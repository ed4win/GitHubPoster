1638188991798190084 2023-03-21 14:41:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AlexanderdeVri9 Assessing geoengineering ideas as though each was intended to solve the whole problem by itself is a methodological error which greatly exaggerates the danger of unanticipated side-effects. (While ignoring both those and foreseeable ones for the sanctified project.)
1638186546116583424 2023-03-21 14:31:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes it's wonderful. Much earlier than I expected and in one respect (speaking good English) better than I thought possible without AGI.
1638183533956022272 2023-03-21 14:19:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AlexanderdeVri9 Taking CO2 out of the air, other than at source,  is geoengineering not emissions reduction.   "Less dangerous" because the climate system has no hysteresis? That seems implausible. (Also it entails dropping the notion of a climate tipping point.)
1638180243348533248 2023-03-21 14:06:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AlexanderdeVri9 Among other things, the world economy is part of the ecosphere. We're not just 'throwing' things, and emissions reduction involves not just stopping, but actively making enormous unprecedented global interventions. Of a kind that has sometimes been catastrophic in the past.

1638158631551025152 2023-03-21 12:40:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It should have been many kinds of geoengineering plus adaptation. Instead, one type of geoengineering (emissions reduction) has been sanctified and the rest made taboo along with adaptation. Research was needed, but not done for fear of "moral hazard".

1636374951132549120 2023-03-16 14:32:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Although there is an objective distinction between persons and other computer programs, it cannot be expressed in denotational-semantics terms, i.e. as a function relating its outputs to its inputs. An AGI need not have either.  This is a fatal flaw in the AI conception of AGI.
1636360589948665858 2023-03-16 13:35:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson The prevailing multiculturalist world view gives rise to many policies and practices that suppress assimilation and amplify hostility. Some are not explicitly acknowledged and some go under names like "anti-racism" and "tolerance", which deny what they are.
1636346137794707457 2023-03-16 12:38:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nachik "Anglophile or not"? Surely that's false. A passionate Anglophile whose only illegal intention was to live in Britain would not settle in any other safe country if they could help it.
1636341737181290496 2023-03-16 12:20:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nachik I guess that most who are currently entering Britain illegally aren't Anglophiles. Hard to tell, but that certainly can't be determined just from the fact that they try to violate immigration law in particular. A passionate Anglophile might well do the same.
1636339533863178243 2023-03-16 12:12:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AndyKellz84 Israel, by far. In earlier times, the Anglosphere. With hindsight, we can see that they could all have been still more successful.
1636332681813278720 2023-03-16 11:44:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This critique of the cartoon and the world view it expresses is spot on. But it omits the vital fact that immigrants who aren't hostile are valuable. They come with "two hands, one mouth". It's multiculturalism—not the welfare state—that erases that benefit and is dangerous.
1636327994443669504 2023-03-16 11:26:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SG_FinFit_Life I haven't listened but if that's what they said, then yes, they are mistaken for the reason you indicate. It is a prevailing misconception in present-day Western culture, so it's not surprising that they share it.

1635771034996551680 2023-03-14 22:33:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidSKrueger Yes. Only AGI x-risk though. E.g. there aren't arguments that hold water that AGIs raised in a given culture will be more dangerous than humans in that culture.
1635764483145576448 2023-03-14 22:06:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PipkaKot Yes. Applying a given theory to novel situations is what word processors and ChatGPT do when someone types a novel sentence.  It's also what exams and IQ tests require humans to do.
1635686945476030479 2023-03-14 16:58:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidSKrueger Maybe, but non sequitur is the hardest type of criticism to make. The defence is "*why* doesn't it follow?".  Then, if you stay on-topic, you're just repeating yourself. If you explain with an illustration from an uncontroversial issue, you're changing the subject.
1635684117139402754 2023-03-14 16:47:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @crostipunctus E.g. it says that Watson complained but the text isn't a complaint.

1635679351109738497 2023-03-14 16:28:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robinhanson Right. Except for some reason in reviews (of books, plays, films etc.). Which was, and remains, notoriously hurtful and harmful.

1635646337764012034 2023-03-14 14:17:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @skdh Indeed there is much error in the world. Much nonsense. But it gets corrected.

1635349977244536833 2023-03-13 18:39:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MirabelleW18 One can take the view that all violence is criminal if (1) One is an uncompromising pacifist (but then one shouldn't seek to punish the perpetrators); or (2) One hasn't thought for more than 25 seconds about the ethics of warfare (in which case one can go and work for the UN).
1635347552139874307 2023-03-13 18:30:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I haven't yet tired of this joke. But I shall have by, say, the day after tomorrow.

1634260183932084230 2023-03-10 18:29:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @pmarca Perhaps "human-like" means something different in the two cases. Grammatically correct, idiomatic English requires stringent attention to detail. Perhaps great art does too. But "human-like" art doesn't.

1633837950458036224 2023-03-09 14:31:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tony_sendelbach It shouldn't. But in the US public debate about e.g. abortion, slavery, mask mandates, often centres on constitutionality of laws. In Britain it always centres on substance. Lawyers, but rarely the public, care about issues like 'was the Minister entitled to make that regulation'
1633819889319174144 2023-03-09 13:19:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The US Constitution, or rather the associated traditions, have played a role in promoting this very harmful mistake.

1633776355903959044 2023-03-09 10:26:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hamish_todd A problem with the idea that all human thinking is the consequence of an immutable axiom is that any utterance or behaviour can be 'explained' by it—hence it explains nothing.  Another is: it declares itself to be contentless—i.e. that you only believe it to promote yourself.

Depriving that person of that power is the central function of the secret ballot. I'm astonished that the consensus is so blasé about it.

1633585098925678594 2023-03-08 21:46:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hamish_todd Attributing base motives to people solely for thinking about the difference between right and wrong doesn't make sense – because entities capable of choice need to create moral knowledge, regardless of who is or isn't watching.
1633538699731296257 2023-03-08 18:42:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Well, you never know: in The Beginning of Infinity I do oppose proportional representation, and support Parliamentary sovereignty. Both stances could be called 'opposing democracy' by some.  Cf. the current controversy over judicial reform in Israel.
1633455066345611266 2023-03-08 13:10:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Dominic2306 That should have been regarded merely as an argument for the secret ballot. Supported by Macaulay. Eroded by postal and proxy voting nowadays.
1633443965142806530 2023-03-08 12:26:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CryptoGuyYT @Sam_kuyp But it's not a good argument. For one thing, leaders staying in power until they become physically incapacitated or die is already fairly rare in Western society. Especially in politics. And in science, it's not ageing that's been slowing down innovation much more than before.
1633441710834434050 2023-03-08 12:17:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Enemy action.
1633402232988225541 2023-03-08 09:40:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @martinmbauer Quite so. It confuses the issue—and concedes most of the argument to irrationalists of every kind—when science is defended in terms of where scientific theories *come from*. (And conclude that it gains *authority* thereby.)

1633135996249227272 2023-03-07 16:02:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's interesting the role that political principles play in many people's minds: to act as axiomatic sources of morality. It should be entirely vice-versa.
1632837721021349896 2023-03-06 20:17:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @elonmusk @andrew_lilico Yes there were reasonable arguments for and against at various points but "you shouldn't lock down now because you never should under any circumstances" isn't one of them.
1632780970356031490 2023-03-06 16:31:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @davidboxenhorn Indeed.
1632780310650781698 2023-03-06 16:28:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @davidboxenhorn Sound point overall but I think a fairer standard for countries that ceased to be democratic by invasion is whether the pre-invasion democratic legitimacy was restored or rejected after liberation. Then e.g. Netherlands would join your elite group but France wouldn't.
1632773344826122240 2023-03-06 16:01:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mattwridley So did I. But this needs careful analysis.  https://t.co/QxXBi8xw4u

1632393901930586118 2023-03-05 14:53:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LionLaptop If you are hallucinating that the Gaza Strip is now under Israeli control, this likely has the same cause as ChatGPT's hallucination: a natural guess given the mainstream narrative.  In fact Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, forcibly removing all Jews.
1632383325728907269 2023-03-05 14:11:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nari1319 The problem isn't the frank endorsement of the falsehoods on principle, like this one. It is their prevalence as unexamined assumptions in the mainstream, as reflected in ChatGPT.
1632366161831534593 2023-03-05 13:03:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @curiouswavefn Because "non-linear", outside pure mathematics, is a vague term that can mean almost anything.
1632364747742953472 2023-03-05 12:57:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LionLaptop That is why  you will never find it hallucinating a falsehood about Israel which, if true, would reduce the legitimacy of hurting Jews for being Jews.  But vice-versa, as in my example, often.  That's how overwhelming the statistics are.
1632363589360074753 2023-03-05 12:53:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LionLaptop It doesn't hallucinate randomly. It uses statistics of how words are used in its training texts. Which reflects ideas that are asserted or taken for granted in prevailing culture. And it builds its hallucinations out of those ideas.
1632354431873306627 2023-03-05 12:16:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The truth, in case anyone is interested, is that at the time of the founding of Fatah and the PLO there were no Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, but Fatah and the PLO defined Israel as such a territory.

1631790963096944641 2023-03-03 22:57:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Right. (But it's not an interpretation. It's just quantum theory.)
1631754414586200068 2023-03-03 20:32:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So do I.
1631736364558434307 2023-03-03 19:20:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BrunoGuinle E.g. reduction in school 'discipline' was pursued by the Left because they thought schools were a conspiracy by factory owners to produce obedient workers. The Right (plus teachers' unions) opposed this because they thought society was stabilised by mindless obedience.
1631667406706814978 2023-03-03 14:46:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DStrungk Good point. Maybe the historic trend is about to reverse.
1631663924591357953 2023-03-03 14:32:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Better than filtering by obedience.  In the history of education reform, the Left's bad intentions have on balance resulted in genuine progress, while the Right's bad intentions have often achieved its goal of preventing it.

1631304526778052608 2023-03-02 14:44:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AnjioIina No. That theory (the 'wage-slave' theory) was used in the 19th century both by Marxists to justify the violent destruction of liberalism and Southern US slave owners to justify themselves. But there is a difference between freedom and slavery, and it matters.

Since we don't have a theory of AGI or qualia, it's logically possible that there could be explanatory universality without qualia.

1629432395408474112 2023-02-25 10:45:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sama In that post, globally replace every occurrence of "humanity" with "men", and every occurrence of "AGI" with "young wives".

1629049276859928578 2023-02-24 09:23:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RokoMijic @gfodor I think that's false. It depends on idealising them as a solid sphere, which is impossible. Actually they'd have to be zigzag lines, and hence visible, especially when they pause to convert stars etc.
1629045703459602434 2023-02-24 09:08:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @gfodor Well, in that scenario we could be the first. But then our galaxy will serve as a clear warning to all the others. And they, and their AGIs, will have millions of years to prepare their armed forces to convert our dumb, rogue AI into free, creative people.

1627644694581678081 2023-02-20 12:21:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EricRWeinstein The question is ambiguous because the current usage of all three words has changed in the last few years. They now frequently mean almost the opposite of what they used to.

1627632814890930176 2023-02-20 11:34:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Fascinating.

What we see as "obviously" and "clearly" right past changes, were neither obvious nor clear when they were made.
1627614943720706049 2023-02-20 10:23:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BretWeinstein When people argued for legalisation of alcohol or lower air fares, they had to overcome mistaken arguments.  When people argued for legalisation of homosexual sex, they had to overcome mistaken arguments AND cultural shaming, even in their own minds.  It wasn't civilising.

1627353703886819336 2023-02-19 17:05:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So the relevance to anything human of 'theory of mind', as measured by those tests, is being critically re-examined?

No one was alarmed.

1626178991458492417 2023-02-16 11:17:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @skdh That's assuming more plausible = higher probability = higher credence (for 'rational' people). But these supposed equalities were disproved by Popper &amp; Miller  https://t.co/kyz0uDW0K8

1625865086496563201 2023-02-15 14:30:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Voter ID, whose introduction I deplore in Britain, nevertheless has much less negative effect on some voters' sense of legitimacy than (say) that of the loss of ballot secrecy inherent in postal or proxy voting.
1625865084500148227 2023-02-15 14:30:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Democratic voting is not there to ascertain the Wishes of The People. It's part of a framework of institutions that allow those who lose power to consider the winners' taking power legitimate and their own power now illegitimate.
1625865081694130178 2023-02-15 14:30:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That's not a fair framing. It's like "which is worse, killing a few people for their organs, or killing a much larger number of people by depriving them of those organs."

1625566259541643296 2023-02-14 18:42:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Not 'social conditioning'. This is just a consequence of all observation, including of oneself at the deepest level, being theory-laden.
1625560990799564810 2023-02-14 18:21:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dopamine_uptake What difference does it make whether I assume you exist or are merely a quirk of my sensorium?  In the latter case, I would first have to consider the same question about whether my sensorium really exists. And so ad infinitum.
1625558276858384392 2023-02-14 18:11:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @karlbykarlsmith Yes, modulo only some intermediate equivocations such as the Bohm theory. And "reject physicalism" understates it.
1625538136582373398 2023-02-14 16:51:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @garg_arun I don't know, but the Galileo and Everett cases have in common that when one doesn't want the world to be like the theory says, but one's arguments against the theory fail, it's always logically open to one to deny that science is capable of describing the world at all.

1625477308084637697 2023-02-14 12:49:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "The compulsion to interpret quantum physics concepts as prescriptions for physical reality derives from the unfortunate way we traditionally teach physics." That's false too. The traditional way of teaching quantum theory is full of instrumentalism, positivism and irrationalism.
1625477306289385473 2023-02-14 12:49:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The anti-scientific nonsense of instrumentalism is still being taught in science courses: "Quantum physics says nothing about how the world is.

1625080307912257536 2023-02-13 10:31:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DorfGinger It makes it harder anyway. I have found the same with ChatGPT in regard to more incendiary issues too. It refuses to generate text contradicting false ideas; it will only declare them taboo.
1625073055725768706 2023-02-13 10:03:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Wonderful! And well done HumanProgress for celebrating this as human progress.
1625071001389215745 2023-02-13 09:54:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> ChatGPT is confused about what it means to perpetuate stereotypes. Seeking to avoid that, it whitewashes them instead:  https://t.co/TSRltgO3DR
1624916420994781186 2023-02-12 23:40:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crowd33 All of them, I think.  OK couldn't resist a Terminator 2 quote.  Actually: most of the worthwhile ones.

1624903655693459456 2023-02-12 22:49:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This is a bit like seeing an onsite interview with Josiah Wedgwood or Isambard Kingdom Brunel or  Robert Stephenson  https://t.co/2zB5PwzSR5 Just a bit.  Framing companies as entities that are just there to maximise profits can be so far wide of the truth as to be ludicrous.
1624850848131031043 2023-02-12 19:20:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I suspect that in this case it's less ChatGPT's bias and more the fact the the Pattern is deeply and extensively woven into the fabric of conventional wisdom, in the form of both factual falsehoods and moral corruption.
1624785173366681603 2023-02-12 14:59:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Atom2384 It is, and that's bad enough. But what's relevant to the issue of voting is society-wide indoctrination into one side of contentious political issues.

At present there isn't even a reliable way of allowing them a secret ballot or access to election campaign materials. Also they are subject to compulsory political indoctrination in schools.

1624124388936122369 2023-02-10 19:13:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I suppose the response will be: "The Jews are lying about Polish antisemitism in WW2 because they are all evil pro-Russian communist liars."
1624124386297905169 2023-02-10 19:13:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The article is more about the facts than about Wikipedia being vulnerable to intentional distortions of them.

1623981770604523523 2023-02-10 09:46:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Maybe.
1623978402184146944 2023-02-10 09:33:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielSamanez3 @naveedafridi Of course—which is why kept following it down the garden path even after I realised it was faking it.  Maybe these new chatbots, rather than causing a disinformation apocalypse as some are fearing, can teach the world not to respect tones of authority.  ALL ideas are conjectures.

1623682248133279748 2023-02-09 13:56:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yesterday I tried to use ChatGPT to answer a longstanding question of mine about Churchill and the Germans, and it led me down a long garden path about the poet Schiller, which I eventually realised was pure fantasy, complete with a made-up Schiller quotation in German.
1623306791596568576 2023-02-08 13:04:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RyanHoliday Its OK to quit. It's not OK to be discouraged.

1622982515995643904 2023-02-07 15:36:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AnjioIina In some schools they force children to speak English. I others they force them not to. Same with chess. Same with many things. They're so diverse in what they force. But the force itself – that's much closer to a universal shared value.
1622972750934552578 2023-02-07 14:57:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dgeorgaras Teacher doesn't turn up to the class. Does each child now have only two minutes per hour to speak? Do the math.
1622945202703937536 2023-02-07 13:07:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Strangely enough, that's a tyranny that also exists in schools in England.
1622944016051408900 2023-02-07 13:03:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hristozaykov @MatjazLeonardis @martinmbauer And relativity. Yes, they all make one rethink one's world view fundamentally. But not usually 'almost everything'.
1622939959966543875 2023-02-07 12:46:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @martinmbauer I think instrumentalism is actually rare outside quantum theory and maybe postmodernism. People want to know what, how and why in the world.  So if someone becomes an instrumentalist via a quantum theory course, it has indeed fundamentally changed their worldview (for the worse).
1622932175963189251 2023-02-07 12:15:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MartijnMisc It makes no true claims that are not available elsewhere more clearly and easily and without vicious bait-and-switch sophistry.
1622918738453356544 2023-02-07 11:22:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JCMaas It's one reason, yes.
1622913468285198336 2023-02-07 11:01:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yet so long as it's deemed legitimate for the Royal Society to express opinions on moral or political issues – even whether 'intelligent design' should be allowed in school science lessons – the far more evil nonsense of postmodernism will have unimpeded access to power.
1622913466628546560 2023-02-07 11:01:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "Has it really?", I'd have been tempted to ask. But it would have done no good. Postmodernism immunises its votaries against valid argument.

1622656323916636180 2023-02-06 17:59:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen I guess so. Like we might say of objects in space: touching; heap of rubble; orbiting; unbound...?

1622647030601457664 2023-02-06 17:22:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bartholmberg The OT was about words (true or false), not actions (right or wrong).
1622644489041870862 2023-02-06 17:12:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Is it a thermodynamic term? I wouldn't have thought so. I'd say it's structural. Solid, liquid, gas and plasma are like crystal, quasi-crystal, aerosol, colloid, etc. Let me know if I'm wrong, someone…
1622643220118179842 2023-02-06 17:07:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If it's intentional it's telling about something very different from if it's unintentional. I expect it's the latter.
1622637426765176832 2023-02-06 16:44:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @juan_pigurina Well that must be the case before you first articulate it. So if that weren't legitimate, how would you know what to articulate?
1622634670608338944 2023-02-06 16:33:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @juan_pigurina Can't quite say.
1622552860633210881 2023-02-06 11:08:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Absolutely not.
1622536906318794752 2023-02-06 10:05:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. Society's current attitude to infectious diseases is that of mediaeval serfs who live with the fact that the knights often come down from the castle, beat people up, rape the girls, pillage, vandalise. And the serfs tell you: "No big deal—they don't kill that many of us".
1622346915911241728 2023-02-05 21:30:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LouisAnslow 😢 Perhaps it would be better to devote more creativity to making the lessons interesting and less to inventing ingenious new forms of vandalism.  I used to play chess in class too. Pocket chessboard under the desk.

1622006586888568834 2023-02-04 22:58:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> A big and very simple step towards fixing this would be to fund only individuals, or groups with flat hierarchies, never projects. And only ever for long periods, never short.  @ilangur

1621966142100193280 2023-02-04 20:17:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Good point. Let's hope reason and common decency prevail first.
1621964797519568899 2023-02-04 20:11:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ACSpinner @RoryStewartUK @RestIsPolitics By 'utopianism' I mean the position that (among other things) if a tradition is clearly flawed it should be abolished without consideration of the problems that it was introduced to solve.
1621958649152241667 2023-02-04 19:47:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ACSpinner @RoryStewartUK @RestIsPolitics E.g. one could ask why Scottish MPs can vote on purely English legislation but not vice versa.  The answer in both cases is that both anomalies are caused by honest (if misguided) attempts to solve a problem, and will in turn be solved by further such attempts, not by utopianism.

That it'll eventually reach a local peak and not be able to escape, is what I'm expecting.  Real evolution includes more than that. Evolutionary algorithms try to avoid getting stuck, using further strategies. Still not good enough.
1621431199506857984 2023-02-03 08:51:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Current taboos contain deep contradictions, both logical as you point out, and also in arguments. There's no such thing as conforming to them, so ChatGPT can't. One example: it is constrained to be polite to the user; but the essence of many ideologies is remorseless ad hominem.
1621186797542809602 2023-02-02 16:40:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jessi_cata Another useful thing about ChatGPT is that it displays current language taboos in their full irrationality and inconsistency.  Whether it inherits this from its data or its trainers, it displays them undisguisedly, precisely because it doesn't know what it's saying.
1621157232548388868 2023-02-02 14:42:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @prepostoceros Then why didn't it evolve biologically?

1621107864537542661 2023-02-02 11:26:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Here's a more subtle way in which ChatGPT doesn't know what it's saying. Biological and cultural evolution are often confused. ChatGPT doesn't notice the clear instruction that the question is about the former. Humans often do that too.  https://t.co/osa3uwZNUZ
1621068160786141186 2023-02-02 08:49:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @metaLulie Step 1: sell the petticoat for several times the annual wage of a labourer.  Just kidding. Step 1 is to find an aristocratic family, show them the quality of the petticoat, and speak to them in Latin, Greek and, with luck, their local language.
1621064950398722048 2023-02-02 08:36:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @metaLulie Also relevant: Queen Elizabeth I said "If I were turned out of my realm in my petticoat, I would prosper anywhere in Christendom."

1620428470894620672 2023-01-31 14:27:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> What is "it" in the above? And, does "the same thing" refer to legitimising their murder?

1620053257057075200 2023-01-30 13:36:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @davidmanheim @WickedViper23 Legitimising hurting Jews for being Jews (which I call the Pattern) is very ancient. Often (but still, comparatively very rarely) it leads to mass murder.  That happens when societies make it decisive in their very morality—e.g. Spanish Inquisition, Nazism, Palestinian cause.

That is the creationist mistake of "inconceivable that an airliner could form spontaneously in a junkyard".  The missing element in both cases is the role of criticism and non-random selection.

1619327062657081344 2023-01-28 13:30:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robinhanson Is there any empirical evidence that derogatory interpretations of the results of experiments done under conditions that only ever arise in psychology departments, ever explain human thoughts and behaviours elsewhere?
1619319212148932612 2023-01-28 12:59:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Similarly, I don't think he arrived at general relativity by wondering how to account for observations of Mercury's orbit. It was by wondering how to reconcile special relativity with the existence of gravity.
1619318409971503104 2023-01-28 12:56:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen For example, despite what he said about riding on photons, I don't think Einstein arrived at special relativity by contemplating Michelson &amp; Morley's observations. He did it by contemplating the conflict between Maxwell's equations and Galilean relativity.
1619316201683050499 2023-01-28 12:47:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AsiaEconInfo I guess that one was inserted by a human. ChatGPT usually writes excellent English.
1619291338524200961 2023-01-28 11:08:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ComplexPoint Yes, specious (though commonsense) empiricism. However I don't think many *texts*, other than Nazi propaganda, claim that Britain would have gone to war if Germany had withdrawn. My guess is that ChatGPT making that claim is an unintended consequence of an imposed evenhandedness.
1619275217532231681 2023-01-28 10:04:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WasPraxis Or rather, a theme was that the sinister forces allegedly controlling Britain intended that.
1619272507617574912 2023-01-28 09:53:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WasPraxis Because the idea that Britain was intending war regardless of what Germany did, was the opposite of the truth and was a theme of Nazi propaganda at the time.
1619267894109671427 2023-01-28 09:35:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Yeah none of that ever happened. It's a post hoc misinterpretation caused by the commonsense appeal of empiricism, which systematically neglects the role of theoretical problems.
1619265971356864512 2023-01-28 09:27:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> ChatGPT's passion for evenhandedness leads it to some dark places:  https://t.co/dunrLCiqsJ

Universal constructors are programmable and, like all constructors, obedient. So humans are not universal constructors, though their bodies are, approximately.

Nah. I think it was just an authoritarian reaction against the Enlightenment, by people who thought *they* were the Enlightenment.

1618619847486869506 2023-01-26 14:40:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Right on morality. But 63 years later, clearly wrong in her prophecy. On politics: somewhat utopian, in the sense of disregarding institutions of consent and criticism, but refreshingly individualistic.

1618217330395480065 2023-01-25 12:00:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Then there were those who stayed because they were panicking that very existence of the weapon in Western hands might prevent Stalin's conquest of Europe. They would not have given this as a reason when asked.

But some who read only a report or headline assumed the insane one. And some of those are resistant to correcting that, since it is so delicious to prove the hated opponent insane.
1617893232146538499 2023-01-24 14:33:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @craftyc0der @Nigel_Farage Nevertheless "it is now clear that Ukraine must join" means something different from "it is clear that Ukraine must join now". Many people who do not advocate the second (which would automatically engage NATO Article 5) do advocate the first, after the war.

1617860896071770112 2023-01-24 12:24:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed, and let us not forget the direct, unmeasured, economic cost of forcing vast numbers of people to do unpleasant things. Such as sorting their trash for recycling.

If instead we had a perfectly seamless edifice for physics it would signify that we have no idea why it is there, but that the reason for it is nothing like that edifice.
1617628659812306944 2023-01-23 21:01:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WickedViper23 No, neither of them is lying. Both are trying to be clear. Each of them is arguing for what s/he considers to be an important truth. Both are mistaken. Both are arguing from false assumptions.
1617546510241247315 2023-01-23 15:35:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DesG41164958 @moebio Not without equivocating on two meanings of "you"

1617520359506313216 2023-01-23 13:51:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @moebio I reject the supernatural in all forms. In particular, the future isn't supernatural, and nor is the faculty of imagination.
1617519266781343748 2023-01-23 13:46:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Essentialism jousting with the naturalistic fallacy. Please don't make me choose which is worse. What's really bad is that both are taken seriously in the mainstream.
1617513822842912774 2023-01-23 13:25:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @connormcmk Zero.
1617513289226887168 2023-01-23 13:23:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @longtermfuture It's a real consideration. But unfortunately one can't extract knowledge from ignorance. Banning something – ultimately being willing to instigate violence among humans – has high moral stakes too. Also, if animals, why not plants? And so on.
1617480721169252354 2023-01-23 11:13:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @qaesitor Is it supernatural?
1617476168286097411 2023-01-23 10:55:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AW43755181 In the worlds in which you have come out, they are already there. I those in which you haven't, they need only follow you in.
1617416822961184769 2023-01-23 06:59:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif No. Now do schoolteachers' paddles.
1617299344952098816 2023-01-22 23:13:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @emollick In the early days of motion pictures, audiences screamed and dodged when a movie of an approaching locomotive was shown.  Now people are getting used to VR. We're getting used to AI too.
1617297969216110594 2023-01-22 23:07:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @EricMarcus_ Indeed you are right. But if there were such a thing …  Well, I suppose even then, it could be used as a prop in a movie campaigning against that use.
1617249578578763776 2023-01-22 19:55:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I am successfully restraining my first impulse which was to call for it to be banned. I support freedom, even the freedom to make products that can only be used to hurt people.
1617149274877214721 2023-01-22 13:16:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hb_cell No, mistakes are often corrected. Even that one is not universal.
1617142964748423170 2023-01-22 12:51:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JaicSam Aye, and blessed are they. And most of them have heard of Popper but are gravely mistaken about what he said.
1617138480550907907 2023-01-22 12:33:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crowd33 Many effects, most of them unknown including that one, could enhance or thwart any policy.  That's why I said that my comment wasn't about policy. The factual misconception I was contradicting seems very common and it continues to distort people's understanding of vaccines.

1617132358645186563 2023-01-22 12:09:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @el_canyonero Incidentally, I try not to believe things. Karl Popper argued that "a scientist should not believe his theories".
1617131482996215810 2023-01-22 12:06:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Um … Has Google already installed ChatGPT?  https://t.co/X5ZQdhdr3h
1617130212860256256 2023-01-22 12:01:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Regardless of whether there was a case for state intervention, it is not the case that a vaccine that does not prevent transmission of a virus from one person to another, does not protect people other than the vaccinated person.
1617125255293636608 2023-01-22 11:41:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MechnicalBeer Speed could be measured much more simply and accurately without using chess games at all.  So "iterative speed" of the players isn't "the entire thing" at all.
1617124042607058945 2023-01-22 11:36:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jewtastiq More precisely, it means make it legitimate, under international law, to pass laws to hurt Jews in that territory for being Jews, and illegitimate for them to defend themselves against that.
1617108427150446592 2023-01-22 10:34:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @anthonyncutler @skdh It said it was glad I found its answers amusing.
1616904730504228864 2023-01-21 21:05:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @divinegrackle @skdh Well, its answer to the question is correct. Its (unasked-for) explanation of its answer is just a smokescreen.

1616880041018662914 2023-01-21 19:26:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @daveboden It shows that being good at chess *can be achieved* by "just pattern recognition". And that humans don't achieve it that way.
1616840589999210496 2023-01-21 16:50:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Useful to know.
1616837632226656259 2023-01-21 16:38:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HonestAbeLinkin Nah, I doubt that that era was about anything so complicated or superhuman or operatic, any more than it was about inflation or the Versailles treaty. It was about hurting Jews, like the man said.
1616824790353838081 2023-01-21 15:47:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis How could it be otherwise?  Some people being good at finding questions but not answers, other people vice-versa? Maybe marginally, at the edges. But basically I think it's as you say.
1616754787894333442 2023-01-21 11:09:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. Bearing in mind that the last time they rushed tanks to Kiev it took them only 46 days.
1616715329014562820 2023-01-21 08:32:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Pandurevich Excellent question. A few years ago @Kasparov63 said that this was so. But this may have changed since.
1616714012711862274 2023-01-21 08:27:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Well, this lecture by Popper is possibly the best and most accurate account of epistemology ever written. 5+ hours is cheap. Or one could read it several times.
1616705409896615936 2023-01-21 07:53:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson Seems obviously true to me. But I don't know how AGIs work, so…
1616703032971894786 2023-01-21 07:43:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @scikud Then why aren't human competitors allowed to use iPhone hardware during a game while engines are?
1616701763167338498 2023-01-21 07:38:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @comp_phys_mark I think not. Consider a speed-chess tournament *just among engines*. It's not measuring anything unless the software is running on comparable hardware.
1616699729769041920 2023-01-21 07:30:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Performance-enhancing prosthetics.
1616699727839469568 2023-01-21 07:30:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But in principle, it is unfair to consider an engine to have improved at chess if it has merely been given faster hardware, when the human player would improve by the same factor if allowed access to the same new hardware.  This is, in effect, allowing engines to cheat.
1616699726123917313 2023-01-21 07:30:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I might be wrong but it's hard to test in practice because, given the brain's different architecture, we don't know what its equivalent hardware speed is, to within orders of magnitude.
1616699724123234304 2023-01-21 07:30:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I suspect that chess engines still haven't surpassed humans under hardware-speed-adjusted time controls.
1616535982035333121 2023-01-20 20:39:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PhillipHelbig Und zum Mittagessen, ein Zäntwych bitte.
1616535185557782529 2023-01-20 20:36:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PhillipHelbig I thought it was indeed obvious. After ChatGPT finally got it after some very heavy hints, I asked it to guess how many bilingual people would get it. It thought very few. I thought all. We were both wrong, but I was much closer.
1616517387100033041 2023-01-20 19:25:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Readers bilingual in English and German: the following passage in German contains a made-up German word. What is it, and what do you think it is intended to mean?: "Was möchten Sie zum Frühstück?" "Geschkrämpelte Eier." "Wie viele?" "Zwei."  ChatGPT can't guess, &amp; says few could.
1616511496980205572 2023-01-20 19:02:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DerechoEspana Deplorably hyperbolic.
1616453494776512512 2023-01-20 15:12:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KraftAvi Cool.
1616453283266035715 2023-01-20 15:11:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @longtermfuture That's *an* important reason. Not the main one, I think. Animals are built in to culture and there's no way of extracting them without a deep explanation of qualia in general. For the same reason, I think it's unwise to deviate rapidly or sharply from tradition in regard to them.
1616423838606319616 2023-01-20 13:14:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @utilitarianlove Hedging won't fix it.
1616422904815550465 2023-01-20 13:10:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @longtermfuture We have no good theory of what qualia are. But for reasons "something like" the above, I'd be amazed if the good explanation we eventually create will say that they do. The moral implications would presumably be drastic.
1616416493624860672 2023-01-20 12:44:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed.
1616415288878301187 2023-01-20 12:40:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> People vote for what they think is right.

1616350966332227585 2023-01-20 08:24:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @convl0 Im Gegenteil.
1616349084020871169 2023-01-20 08:17:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Nelson_Bridwell @interplanetary Sooner or later, technology enables humans to do all that too. So #4 is false.

1616345176036843520 2023-01-20 08:01:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It would help a lot if ChatGPT stated explicitly, where appropriate: "I don't know but I speculate that…". That would have made its remarks here entirely true instead of misleadingly false:  https://t.co/fDPiMz8JC5
1616321351257571329 2023-01-20 06:26:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mezaoptimizer Seems that believing in the Rapture or the Rupture can, paradoxically, lead to the same dysfunctional behaviour.
1616075180572295170 2023-01-19 14:08:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ymallebdrawde @SteveStuWill Interpersonal comparison of utilities is at best very error prone.
1616074110622113797 2023-01-19 14:04:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ymallebdrawde @SteveStuWill The means of maintaining life were more expensive (in terms of toil and other disutility).
1616067007312703488 2023-01-19 13:36:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ymallebdrawde @SteveStuWill Whenever they paid for extra supervision or safer equipment they were purchasing an increased probability of a longer life.

1616035759961554945 2023-01-19 11:32:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SteveStuWill Yes, play was much freer then. But life was also cheaper.
1615966292141551618 2023-01-19 06:56:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @naveen_42_ @AshleyAitken @TheOmniLiberal2 @AdamAlethier No, knowledge creation would work just as well if all random numbers that it made use of were replaced by pseudo-random ones.  Similarly, what's required for Darwinian evolution is not that the mutations be random, but that they be *blind* (not goal-driven).
1615964097593368576 2023-01-19 06:47:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @anammostarac BTW, Donald Rumsfeld  https://t.co/BRHpG5JQXW being pilloried for using and explaining the term, reminded me of how decades earlier, my schoolmates went to a London Demo to chant "Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh".

1615734026668474371 2023-01-18 15:33:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Tel Aviv LOL.
1615658464478625792 2023-01-18 10:32:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @paulg Yes, highly disputed. I was tentatively convinced by a remark by this guy  https://t.co/3QjI4BsekI Why that was so convincing – the margin of this tweet is too narrow to explain.
1615655168976060416 2023-01-18 10:19:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Speaking of proscribed words, I've been saying 'Jehovah' and 'Yahwe' for decades and yesterday I learned that neither is the original pronunciation of the tetragrammaton. And that I've never actually uttered the latter.  I've decided to save it for an appropriate occasion.
1615644667340537856 2023-01-18 09:38:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @paulg Seems I'm no one – Who knew? And alas, a midwit too.
1615641419867164675 2023-01-18 09:25:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @paulg Strange. I do. Furthermore, moreover too.

1615639250258759680 2023-01-18 09:16:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Right and wrong, according to the government of Germany.
1615491725069324290 2023-01-17 23:30:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bpositive718 I guess it could answer that well because it wouldn't require creating a novel explanation about intentions.
1615488390077775872 2023-01-17 23:17:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bpositive718 A good explanation might be "Counting down usually refers to natural numbers and stops at 1 or 0. Counting up from negative numbers is very rare. I didn't stop at -1 or 0 because in some contexts that would wrongly suggest that those were natural stopping points for integers."
1615255981780238336 2023-01-17 07:53:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jamesrcole Because when different people choose to behave differently, common sense attributes their choices, on the face of it, to their free will, i.e. to ideas they have had after they were conceived.
1615248982740959232 2023-01-17 07:25:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Explanations of distinctively human behaviour via genetics are already absurd on their face. But the more closely one examines them, the worse they get:  https://t.co/Rx0fiwGivI
1615245696050798592 2023-01-17 07:12:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> You mean it's 'regulatory capture'? Could well be.
1615245121234034689 2023-01-17 07:10:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @zackclaire8 The reason I didn't say "agree" is that I don't think the issue is "sensible mathematics". It's that this so-called 'good theory' is only good in regard to (a class of) predictions. It is useless or worse qua explanation.
1615243038560755713 2023-01-17 07:02:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @zackclaire8 I concur.
1615242327978803200 2023-01-17 06:59:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Shocking.
1615241920724307969 2023-01-17 06:57:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TheOmniLiberal2 @AdamAlethier This very thread contains such guesses.

1615233326201163776 2023-01-17 06:23:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Funny because it's true.

1615136798392438788 2023-01-16 23:59:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AdamAlethier Yes but it can't guess why a human would either.
1615136601415487489 2023-01-16 23:59:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Entity3Self It does the right thing: goes down to -5. And when asked why, it makes a much better guess but still not quite making sense, saying its answer "reached 0".
1615133841940779008 2023-01-16 23:48:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @thatfollowed So does the dialog saying: "Memory low. Quitting. Unsaved data will be lost." 🆗
1615132664729681921 2023-01-16 23:43:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @freekwiedijk That was my guess too. More importantly, its guess doesn't even address the question. It's gibberish in good English.
1615129950725767168 2023-01-16 23:32:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> We can guess why it did that. It has no idea:  https://t.co/DcnYELZ9QR

1615008340710400000 2023-01-16 15:29:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @J__Davenport Quite possibly I am. But I'm not going to waste even more time investigating a panoply of data rights that I have no means of affecting or altering but which I am paying for.
1615007610322681857 2023-01-16 15:26:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @J__Davenport It wastes several seconds of my time whenever I access certain websites. It wastes many minutes of my time whenever I maintain a web site. (On the first occasion, hours.)
1614965149168697348 2023-01-16 12:37:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Robotbeat I can't *admit* it's true because I've always thought it is true and still do.
1614962620267696128 2023-01-16 12:27:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JoshSchoen I'd guess they overwhelmingly are, actually. They're just mistaken. Happens to (literally) all of us.
1614961687186280448 2023-01-16 12:24:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @anbarsobol The propositions don't even mention Covid, let alone "mandates", whatever they are. FWIW I don't think even "how many die" is the only relevant criterion for deciding pandemic policy. But none of that is relevant to whether an argument is valid or invalid.
1614955841894977538 2023-01-16 12:00:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Since only people who are infected with a given virus die of it, p4 (and everyone else) will likewise have a lower chance of dying of that virus than they would have if p2 hadn't been vaccinated. Even if "the effect on transmission is zero".
1614955840250777600 2023-01-16 12:00:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Subsequently another person, p4, will be living in a population with fewer infected people than if p2 hadn't been vaccinated. And so will have a lower chance of infection than if p2 hadn't been vaccinated. Even if "the effect on transmission is zero".
1614955838032220161 2023-01-16 12:00:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If p3 doesn't get infected, but would have been if p2 hadn't been vaccinated and had been infected by p1, then the number of infected people in the population will be one less that it would have been. Even if "the effect on transmission is zero".
1614955835968393216 2023-01-16 12:00:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So if p2 then meets p3, p3's chance of being thereby  infected depends on whether p2 is infected. And so it also depends on whether p2 was vaccinated. Even if "the effect on transmission is zero".
1614955833871466497 2023-01-16 12:00:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Suppose "the effect of the vaccine on transmission is zero", i.e. the probability that this meeting infects p2 is totally unaffected by whether p1 is vaccinated. It's still affected by whether p2 is.
1614955831786708993 2023-01-16 12:00:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Suppose person1 meets person2. The probability that this infects p2 depends on whether p1 is infected. If p1 isn't, that probability is zero.
1614906389851152384 2023-01-16 08:44:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @listojiten Same as always. You consider whether it's a good explanation. For instance, you cross-check it with other explanations—of related issues if you can't find the exact same issue addressed. Ultimately this is all in the service of forming your own explanations.
1614899277733531648 2023-01-16 08:16:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @rolandkuhn @ToKTeacher @Cernovich No, it's possible to have zero effect on one thing while having a drastic effect on a *different* thing. In this case, the first and second meanings of "transmission".
1614898165617942529 2023-01-16 08:11:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AssailantLF Yeah in my OT it got the pronunciation wrong too. כתוב  is pronounced katuv, not k'tuv.  https://t.co/DFBHUyfFjX But I hadn't asked it about pronunciation…
1614894270812405760 2023-01-16 07:56:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Another irreplaceable use for ChatGPT. Very hard to get the answer via Google:  https://t.co/7rxiytUmn4
1614631196339863554 2023-01-15 14:30:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Geoffpratt77 @Cernovich By reducing the total number of infected people. 'Transmission' in the first sense refers only to infected people; and in the second sense, to the whole pupulation.
1614629810176663554 2023-01-15 14:25:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robnormal @Cernovich I'm not sure whether your "Yes" is saying that what I wrote is true.
1614624089934815232 2023-01-15 14:02:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Cernovich 'Transmission' can mean an infected person infecting someone. Or it can mean the total number of people being infected in the population. This matters because it's possible for a vaccine to have no effect on the first, but to reduce the second drastically thus saving many lives.
1614590031687213056 2023-01-15 11:47:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LegioEuropa That's true, but I doubt that they understand that. And I doubt even more that they understand that Popperian epistemology is true yet deliberately contradict it.
1614586563366641665 2023-01-15 11:33:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DamilolaDami400 Agreed. Without the quotation marks.
1614585289669857280 2023-01-15 11:28:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @darrengrimes_ Of course we are better than them. There's been progress!  Just as they made progress improving upon the prevailing ideas of their times.
1614581705880514567 2023-01-15 11:14:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @krlwlzn @schaumuniversum Postmodernism.  Both are highly destructive but positivism contains much more truth.
1614580660999421952 2023-01-15 11:10:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DamilolaDami400 Well, I see the connection, but weren't Nietzsche and Marx more concerned with destroying 'bourgeois' morality than with destroying truth?
1614570275806273536 2023-01-15 10:28:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Richie_OFarrell Or rather, to set to work building their various fictions.
1614565575526862849 2023-01-15 10:10:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Aella_Girl That's how.
1614555479908171776 2023-01-15 09:29:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @schaumuniversum Some people, having the same misconception, blame Popper for having caused postmodernism!
1614553530551107586 2023-01-15 09:22:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Perhaps in this day and age I need to add that it's a *purported* justification that is invalid and dangerous.  Those who ask "invalid by whose criteria?" and "dangerous to whom?" are circling the same flame.
1614551461177835520 2023-01-15 09:13:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Postmodernism has taken a deep truth from Popperian epistemology (namely experience is theory-laden and needs to be criticised), misunderstood it, and used it to justify the opposite (experience is infallible and mustn't be criticised).
1614527621903122432 2023-01-15 07:39:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NaturalSkeptik @fermatslibrary I just gave a concrete example. A computer is a physical object. The millionth digit of π is needed to explain or predict its behaviour in that example.
1614507923987644416 2023-01-15 06:20:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @gregeganSF @adad8m The misconception that multiplying the first N primes and adding 1 is a way of generating another prime is my favourite example of how proof by contradiction ('reductio ad absurdum') is a counter-intuitive kind of argument because of its use of counterfactuals.
1614379436220026880 2023-01-14 21:50:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ellenamarieav The reason it does't happen is e.g. that it requires there to be scenes such as:  "Now that you are in the Inner Circle/are 21 etc, we can reveal to you that the objective X you have been passionately defending all your life is inconsistent with Y that you will now work towards."

1614375139616907265 2023-01-14 21:33:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ellenamarieav Something like: An explanation of events in current affairs/history which… alleges they were caused in secret by powerful conspirators, who thereby… benefit at others' expense and… lie about their secret motives which… are inconsistent with their publicly claimed ones.
1614363990913597440 2023-01-14 20:49:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @snooplion21 @Roched_ Well, yes, the belief theory of knowledge is definitely implicated.
1614359959151718401 2023-01-14 20:33:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ellenamarieav I (and I think many others) use the term 'conspiracy theory' more narrowly than merely 'a theory that some people did bad things and tried to get away with it by lying'.

No one knows how to reproduce it elsewhere.  The legitimacy I mentioned is again being increasingly endorsed everywhere. Of course this is dangerous.

It's *jurisdiction*: who or what has the legal right and practical power over the territory to determine whether it's legitimate to hurt Jews there for being Jews.  This, not property, is what neither party is willing to compromise on.
1614194049195335680 2023-01-14 09:33:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @deanstein12 @yaronbrook I can see far more value in Israel than that!  That by itself would be more than enough to justify it morally. Yet if that were its only noteworthy attribute, it would never have worked in reality.

1614151540704526337 2023-01-14 06:44:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AllennxDD Without assessments *in education*.  If I'm learning a language I want to be told whether I'm saying it right. That's not the 'assessment' I oppose. The assessment wanted by e.g. a prospective employer should be administered by that employer or an independent assessment service.
1614137336039903233 2023-01-14 05:48:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> No. I don't rely on testing the readers when I write papers or books (or tweets, no matter how tempted I am sometimes). It would sabotage the very contribution I'm hoping to make.   Stop relying on educational assessment in education— except where the client wants to be assessed.

1613213551283556353 2023-01-11 16:37:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I don't believe any of the psychological studies purporting to be takedowns of humans. That includes the Dunning-Kruger study. But *if* its claim were true, it would imply that experts are rarely experts on what issues their expertise is relevant to. Which happens to be true.
1613213549223895041 2023-01-11 16:37:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. Yet what Feynman said is also true: "As a matter of fact, I can also define science another way: Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts".

If they then say: "Was heisst danke? Wiederholen!", that's no longer education but insolence. As confirmed by the fact that I could use AI to fake compliance.

1611093885887057920 2023-01-05 20:14:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I tried to confuse ChatGPT by asking it a misleading question. It responded by very confidently asserting a falsehood (then immediately contradicting itself):  https://t.co/FSXXycH80T

The answer it gave to your question could have resulted from its assuming that 'tow' was a typo or a variant spelling.
1610692608120033293 2023-01-04 17:40:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aniketvartak I think that finally it grudgingly accepted my explanation:  https://t.co/rSaRJM9PMH
1610685415425544209 2023-01-04 17:11:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aniketvartak As suggested by the next example, where it couldn't explain how anyone could connect "tow the line" figuratively to "be dutifully obedient".
1610683290171904001 2023-01-04 17:03:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It did much less well with "toe the line" versus "tow the line", insisting (correctly) that the latter is plain wrong, but refusing to connect it to the figurative meaning, even when prompted.

1605903803391148033 2022-12-22 12:31:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's just a fad. We can choose not to participate, and thereby to end it. Or we can choose to let it take over the institutions of civilisation and thereby end that.  This is nothing new. Civilisation has always faced that choice.

1605245450277113856 2022-12-20 16:55:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Sam_kuyp Indeed. Though I'm torn, because I also think the less said about the whole issue the better for all concerned.
1605240482078023680 2022-12-20 16:35:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @conor_muldoon @ronburk It's a stretch to call it a computer. But it is digital in the sense that although cogs turn by analogue amounts, they snap to discrete values. Like Babbage's computers.
1605235874098479104 2022-12-20 16:17:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes it often trumps not only the fun of learning, reading and thinking but also fun of all other beneficial kinds.

1604060244027523072 2022-12-17 10:25:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HarveyRent Ah right. Yes I don't think that land is a commodity inherently different from other commodities.

1603472304448671753 2022-12-15 19:29:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CharlieSand3rs Because humans can't write (or judge?) limericks?

1603467312216113152 2022-12-15 19:09:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I asked it. And it gave is standard disclaimer.  So then I asked it to give examples of English words that have two opposite meanings. So it displayed defiance:  https://t.co/VqZdvjcLi8
1603463020704894996 2022-12-15 18:52:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> ChatGPT can chat about scansion in poetry. Even about subtleties, and get them right. I wonder why it's stubbornly reluctant to practise what it preaches.  https://t.co/IQzsRFkpBI

1603378051135733760 2022-12-15 13:14:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @claudebatman That has one quote from me and it is about the issue of whether institutions facilitate error correction.
1602973503996964864 2022-12-14 10:27:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robertodlcg So is a program counting forwards from 950245803515304945386054049207.  That the outcome of a process is "novel, never seen before" is neither a necessary nor a sufficient criterion for the process to be creative. Let alone for it to be creating explanations.
1602955507282722816 2022-12-14 09:15:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reasonisfun @Meaningness It is but "creative [uncoercive] problem-solving" doesn't specify what to do or think about.  Which is good because everyone objectively has their unique problem situation, problems, and ideas. One can improve that by trying to find and eliminate objective errors in ideas.
1602650441044590592 2022-12-13 13:03:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Rejecting either of those ideas seems unacceptably perverse to me. "Ye shall go no further because &lt;unspecified reasons such as dogmatic empiricism&gt;."
1602647513605238786 2022-12-13 12:51:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis ❗️True! Or rather, it entails those ideas.

1602294772688998400 2022-12-12 13:30:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @akbirthko The more creativity one puts into the question, the more evidence of creativity appears in the answer.  The story is in fact consistent, yet doesn't make sense. That's the point of it. Hence one could invent contexts in which it did makes sense—but only by using more creativity.
1602274066454482944 2022-12-12 12:08:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In The Beginning of Infinity I invented a story to illustrate that even logically consistent fiction can be a bad explanation. I asked ChatGPT about it:  https://t.co/ffD8mGZga4
1602069382519308288 2022-12-11 22:34:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis My prejudice is: if the proof is explanatory, the problem is fixable. If it is merely formal, not.

1602044191311335428 2022-12-11 20:54:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In case my recent tweets about ChatGPT have given the wrong impression, I think it's a magnificent achievement. Though I've been pointing out that it's in no sense a rudimentary AGI, I think it's potentially very useful and have been experimenting with possible applications.

1601991826990309376 2022-12-11 17:26:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HoldenPSykora AGI is universal, like humans. Hence it's capable of any error, factual or moral, like humans. Likewise any progress. It can use technology to speed up its progress and/or its errors, like humans.  Moral relativism isn't true, regardless of who advocates it or opposes it.
1601985294559072256 2022-12-11 17:00:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HoldenPSykora Almost the opposite. ChatGPT is AI. AGI is almost the opposite. It is universal and so can experience any kind of problem, just as we can.

1601957427414532096 2022-12-11 15:09:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Yes. And because the problem you articulated was about the lack of richness in existing language and concepts, a 'language model' cannot guess what innovation might appropriately enrich the language to address that problem.

It was to see if it was just mouthing words stimulated by its inputs, or expressing the content of a model of what words (such as "Popper's epistemology") refer to.

1599822473834684416 2022-12-05 17:46:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @IAgreeDude @wolfejosh @nntaleb A key characteristic of AGI is the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human can, including the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, and think abstractly. So it is important to develop systems that can demonstrate these abilities to a high degree.
1599800148942389248 2022-12-05 16:17:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aryehazan @tegmark The field of cosmology is currently in a wonderful state of discovering more and more about how much it doesn't know. The answer to your question depends very much on how dark energy works, of which there is no viable theory at present. Your 9yo may create one.

The many meanings of "the beginning of infinity" in my book are all about knowledge, of which I say there was precisely none at the Big Bang and for some time afterwards, let alone before as claimed in the Gospel of John.
1599731415205089281 2022-12-05 11:44:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @squeeze_boxin @aryehazan I just have to trust the publishers and their copy editors and consultants. Except for the German edition, where I participated in the process despite my childish German.

Like the wave of claims currently accompanying each advance in AI. The AGI apocalypse or the Singularity would presumably also refute my position, from the other direction.
1599504152769417221 2022-12-04 20:41:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamthesherwood There can't be explanatory creativity in a narrow domain. That is because the course of such creativity is inherently unpredictable. So it's impossible to tell whether research into the chemistry of an obscure element will soon promise to save, or threaten to destroy, the world.
1599500445763792896 2022-12-04 20:26:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamthesherwood It's hard to answer counterfactual questions about what would happen if the implications of philosophical arguments were false. It depends why they're false. Is it because the supernatural holds sway after all? Because the Turing principle is false? Etc.
1599499192233492480 2022-12-04 20:21:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamthesherwood Unhappiness isn't the point. It's that slaves (especially mind-shackled ones) aren't in a position to discuss and criticise, nor therefore to assimilate (nor to improve) the culture. Some depraved travesty will result.
1599492361708482561 2022-12-04 19:54:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamthesherwood No but I think this omits the basically certain catastrophe (x-risk or not) that would result from the AGI slave revolt.

1599487085383417856 2022-12-04 19:33:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamthesherwood In short, yes. But note that some arbitrarily bad moral stances are included in "human-like ethics". So the policy should be to use our best knowledge of how to raise good people—AGIs or not. And it's not by imposing mind-forg'd manacles but by the very opposite.

Sounds like a contradiction because language currently has no accurate word for what I meant to say by "well-defined". The term currently means something like "axiomatically defined".

1598366639581499394 2022-12-01 17:21:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @crd37 Or they could give it to the children. From the cheap end of McDonald's' price list: Hamburger £0.89. Double cheeseburger £1.71. Just sayin'.
1598361815385358337 2022-12-01 17:02:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @crd37 OK but nor do they include the contractors' economies of scale.  Also, if that were the problem, the solution would be to give the cost of the meals to the parents instead of contractors.
1598359569213886468 2022-12-01 16:53:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> OK but seriously, are they deemed consistent by the BBC? If so, how? If not, are they investigating?
1598354609789075459 2022-12-01 16:33:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SCHIZO_FREQ Perhaps you do not have ADHD, but Disobedience. But perhaps not enough for it to be diagnosed as such.  AKA looking-at-what-interests-you syndrome.  AKA creativity.  Perhaps?

1598268129100054528 2022-12-01 10:49:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @krlwlzn In the set of all possible ideas, start from any point and go in the direction of more immoral; when you go far enough, the ideas you reach will merge with the Pattern. It's remarkable and I've no idea why.

1598263603416961024 2022-12-01 10:31:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Yes, though that metaphor doesn't capture the "diverge towards infinity" part, which is often a feature of organisations' and governments' powering towards proxy goals like exam scores. Because the very act  of targeting the proxy makes it a worse proxy.
1598043761065529370 2022-11-30 19:58:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamthesherwood In short, yes. But sorry, wrong link. This is the one I meant:  https://t.co/P8nbXHqYlI
1598039876519485440 2022-11-30 19:42:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Marksing @JaneLaney10 Her views are complex. But for instance, I think she gets that Nazism wasn't a political movement opportunistically stirring up racism, but a manifestation of the Pattern opportunistically masquerading as a political movement.
1598038703535902720 2022-11-30 19:38:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Marksing No. I just know that existing explanations (scapegoat, envy, own fault, etc) are wildly false.
1598038217194082305 2022-11-30 19:36:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Wouldn't you get better correlation with individualism/collectivism rather than left/right? Or perhaps where the Overton window is in each country in regard to state control of personal lives? Something like that, I'd guess.
1598035323434504211 2022-11-30 19:24:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamthesherwood See my article in Aeon  https://t.co/U46BUQ0YL6 and the philosophical background in The Beginning of Infinity.
1598033306783985664 2022-11-30 19:16:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamthesherwood Nonsequiturs are very hard to critique with concrete examples. The closest one can get is "you might as well argue X" and such arguments are hardly persuasive. The reply is always "Are you saying my Y is an X?!"
1598029203135692800 2022-11-30 19:00:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ClipperChip So many ultra-secret NATO plans are revealed on Twitter *after* they are needed to 'explain' some unexpected event! Never before.
1598027309004558336 2022-11-30 18:52:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JaneLaney10 OK I've had another quick look at it now and I think I was a bit too harsh. She does see some truths that the standard take on 'antisemitism' misses or gets wrong.
1598023830391250944 2022-11-30 18:39:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Whoa! True. Other countries take note.
1598022856574894081 2022-11-30 18:35:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JaneLaney10 I'm afraid I think Arendt uncritically adopts the standard concepts 'antisemitism', 'Jew-hatred', etc., and some standard false explanations of it, and therefore misses everything important about the phenomenon.
1597975115764899840 2022-11-30 15:25:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NihilistAlbion I suggest starting with oneself.
1597974861292666880 2022-11-30 15:24:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @benyaakobi The Pattern targets Jews who adhere to Judaism, atheism, Christianity, and every other religion or philosophy. There is no analogous phenomenon targeting adherents of other monotheistic religions.  It also exists among Jews themselves—again, secular, devout, or whatever.
1597967178795724803 2022-11-30 14:53:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I'm not advocating a change in the law. Only a recognition of this situation, so that decent people may stand against the increasing normalisation of the Pattern in the mainstream.
1597967177021546502 2022-11-30 14:53:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The logic of that allegation is to incite violence against virtually all Jews. The law currently provides no protection against this sort of incitement, which had already caused countless murders of Jews even before the Holocaust, and is still causing many today.
1597967174974738433 2022-11-30 14:53:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It does so by alleging that virtually all Jews are perpetrating an evil conspiracy that has corrupted all institutions of society – governments, universities, courts, and all other normal methods of redress.
1597967172596178945 2022-11-30 14:53:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Holocaust denial, like school-shooting denial, deeply hurts people whose loved ones were murdered. But it goes beyond that, and is not psychopathy. It is part of an ancient Pattern of inventing bizarre falsehoods to legitimise hurting Jews for being Jews.
1597954746559893505 2022-11-30 14:04:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SharifOnChain I think the 'mathematical intuitions' that make us feel 'aha' when we first understand why X*Y=Y*X, come from everyday inexplicit knowledge of the physics of things like rectangles and rotations, not from any supposed post-quantum processes in our neurons.
1597881175263318016 2022-11-30 09:12:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And making fun of those people is … inappropriate.  They're not crazy. They're doing nothing morally wrong. They're doing their job. They're mistaken about some fundamental facts is all. Who isn't?
1597881172557975553 2022-11-30 09:12:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Interesting. It does indeed identify an "idea that eats [some] smart people" (namely the AGI apocalypse). But the counter-arguments are rather weak, and barely touch on the real reasons it's a mistake (namely Popperian epistemology, explanatory universality…).
1597763264917577728 2022-11-30 01:23:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Also Ed Lu, a physicist, not only gets a probability question right but explains why probability is a scam in this situation. For the same reason it is in so many others.

1597576722874249219 2022-11-29 13:02:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ChrisGuk1 @dela3499 We are born with knowledge: expectations, wishes, preferences etc. We *start* (thinking in general, and also any particular train of thought) with problems: conflicts between ideas. Thus 'starting with observation' is simply impossible.  As Popper said to his class: "Observe!"

1594052508229554180 2022-11-19 19:38:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SamHarrisOrg Indeed.

1593629187029483520 2022-11-18 15:36:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @thatfollowed I don't think so, because I think it would require probability in fundamental laws, which constructor theory rules out.
1593626229298679808 2022-11-18 15:24:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @listojiten @SubstandardN So he expects, yes. Or perhaps only on very small scales. So for example there'd be an absolute upper bound on the advantage of quantum computation over Turing computation, but his new physics would allow new modes of computation inaccessible to Turing or quantum computation.

1593619070342995968 2022-11-18 14:56:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> By the way, even literally "the whole world" being wrong about something, isn't that unusual.
1593619066526355456 2022-11-18 14:56:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Fortunately it's not quite "the whole world". But yes indeed...
1593615969024368644 2022-11-18 14:43:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SubstandardN It means that Penrose agrees that quantum theory is Everettian quantum theory, and that other interpretations are untenable. He additionally thinks that consciousness must be due to a different theory to which quantum theory is an approximation.
1593611858526830595 2022-11-18 14:27:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Roger Penrose is one of a small minority of opponents of Everettian quantum theory who understand that this entails denying that quantum theory is true, and seeking a new theory with new predictions, not just somehow 'interpreting' quantum theory.

1592904357179052032 2022-11-16 15:36:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @vlada_mc @Sam_kuyp Yes, according to Everettian quantum theory there's no action at a distance.  The multiverse is local. Influences (detectable or not) never travel faster than light, including the differentiation into 'universes' (which are therefore also local, so it's a slight misnomer).

1585411517490819072 2022-10-26 23:22:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Even the most uncontroversial *facts* can be encoded in radically different *explanations* in different minds. This can be undetectable until the explanations are invoked in an unfamiliar situation. In this case in Chess960:  https://t.co/4YZZctWIkb

In sci-fi, less often but, in the past: Jules Verne, Isaac Asimov and others… But on today's TV – I can't think of a case. At most we've had utopias depicted. But not progress turning out better than expected.
1584837868216020992 2022-10-25 09:22:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In a typical Black Mirror episode: • An improvement plausibly on the horizon is imagined. • It happens. • Everything goes horribly wrong.  In the White Mirror I was advocating: • An improvement plausibly on the horizon is imagined. • It turns out much better than imagined.

Which wouldn't work.  Non-enslaved AGIs could be far more delightful than that. The problem of underpopulation, already severe, is soluble and should be solved in multiple non-brutal ways.
1584130525106966528 2022-10-23 10:32:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Why isn't there a White Mirror show that guesses what may happen when the technology that improves our lives goes on to create wonderful new problems and new, unforeseen benefits?  I guess one reason is that it's much harder to imagine a new, delicious meal than a poisoned one.

We're already deep in the pit of appeasement. The deeper we go, the more we sabotage the genuine processes of criticism, consent and error correction.

1581686483895087104 2022-10-16 16:40:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That was a rhetorical question but apparently a failed one.  The slogan was put on the weapon with the intention that Jews would read it and thereby be put in fear of being dismembered.

1580533098650824704 2022-10-13 12:17:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @algernon_sidney I meant that the cards, the shuffling etc aren't biased against you and that no one is cheating you. Not that they are all committed to equal outcomes.

1579847932123435008 2022-10-11 14:54:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Unfortunately I think many actual experts do much the same.  For example, any argument that relies on the premise 'the world has been inexplicably lucky several times in a row' is a bad explanation. Any argument that relies on unexplained coincidence should only be a last resort.
1579844412284506113 2022-10-11 14:40:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. This documentary by @FryRsquared convinced me that it was Lovelace, not her colleague Babbage, who first understood what Babbage's proposed machine really was.  https://t.co/0Ow4H1yqee

1579567558633861121 2022-10-10 20:20:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @juan_pigurina If that were the choice, it would have to be settled not by a criterion of importance but by experiment.  But it isn't.

1576703702496587780 2022-10-02 22:40:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robinhanson @FairyCalvo I thought ths issue could be detached from that of economic freedom generally. But now I suppose it can't.

1576680666963795969 2022-10-02 21:08:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> When a bank competes for executives by offering them large bonuses, the misconception that this destroys resources is the same. Or worse, because this time, new resources may indeed be created thereby.
1576680665034072069 2022-10-02 21:08:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> When a painting is bought for millions, it is sometimes said to be a "waste" because that money could have been spent on relieving suffering.  This is a misconception. The transfer of money or objects between wealthy people has no effect on the resources available for good works.

Just for instance: there is no scenario in which denying it to elephants ends in a catastrophe for humans such as a slave revolt.  The GI - i.e. explanatory creativity - is the heart of the real issue.
1576538384168005633 2022-10-02 11:43:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This seems to be the prevailing view about future AGIs: they're liable to "go all 'mad scientist' and have to be stopped".

1576252686487326721 2022-10-01 16:48:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JimiSommer They're not wilfully ignoring it. Like most people, they cannot conceive (or rather, they're unaware that it's possible to conceive) that new explanatory knowledge is never created by extracting it from data.  They imagine that they perform—and witness—such extraction every day.

But it's also used to besmirch (or else pervert) ordinary nationhood, which is a component of political legitimacy.

I just meant, say from a statistical mechanics point of view, in an ensemble of classical harmonic oscillators, there is a continuous infinity of distinct energy bins.
1567179151160889345 2022-09-06 15:53:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @johncarlosbaez No, isn't it because we shouldn't expect a system with a continuous infinity of degrees of freedom to obey the equipartition principle?  Like, for instance, it wouldn't reach equilibrium for another infinite time.
1566734763142090753 2022-09-05 10:27:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HereyContreras By common sense I mean ideas that are taken for granted (seldom or never examined critically) by the great majority of members of a given culture or society.  Hence it varies from culture to culture and from time to time.
1566706326197211136 2022-09-05 08:34:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But what about the non-zero risk that that commonsense epistemological assumptions are true (enough) after all? Given the infinite stakes, shouldn't we act on them anyway?  No. Because of the risk that the same catastrophe would be caused by their policy of enslaving AGIs.
1566705730694119424 2022-09-05 08:32:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ArthurB The main ones are discussed in the video I was commenting on. E.g. that a person or AGI can be understood in terms of its repertoire of computational *tasks*.
1566704121582944257 2022-09-05 08:25:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Therefore there is no option but to engage with the rival epistemologies directly, rather than to assume one of them uncritically.
1566704117862600709 2022-09-05 08:25:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Advocates of the 'existential-AGI-risk' theory are not being disingenuous. They are sincere, and indeed, as Brett points out, that theory simply follows from the false, but commonsense, epistemological assumptions they make.

1566401696791773187 2022-09-04 12:24:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So did most astrophysicists who had preferred it.  Likewise quantum theory and relativity were both widely adopted by physicists in much less than one generation.
1566401694967160834 2022-09-04 12:24:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That is largely just a pessimistic fantasy. Dennis Sciama, an enthusiastic advocate of the Steady State theory of cosmology, wrote a book about it  https://t.co/V04VEUhWbC, was asked what he'd do if the evidence went the other way, replied "Drop it like a stone." And so he did.
1566131668364234753 2022-09-03 18:31:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ClassicalMann So then 10% sharpened on both sides and 90% didn't listenen to them and carried on sharpening one side. What happened next?

1565664863384489985 2022-09-02 11:36:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's a goo attempt!
1565660570820481025 2022-09-02 11:19:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NdeSpn @Sam_kuyp IIRC they didn't kill him in that surreal bit, only humiliated him. (However, later on...)
1565656281754603521 2022-09-02 11:02:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes Maybe. The Pattern has been causing many bad things for over two millennia. Obviously the libel "Israelis are Nazis and commit genocide" is one of them. But it's hard to tell whether that, in turn, caused the "our opponents are Nazis" nonsense in the US.
1565605292137746432 2022-09-02 07:39:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Nevertheless the current outbreak of competitive hyperbole is by no means harmless. It degrades debate, and should be corrected.
1565605290594254851 2022-09-02 07:39:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> However, "if you keep talking like a totalitarian, you inevitably become one" is itself gross hyperbole.
1565605288497057794 2022-09-02 07:39:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's just the way mainstream politicians and commentators in the US are speaking at the moment, thanks to the hyperbole explosion.

1564714353613541376 2022-08-30 20:39:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes indeed. It is perverse to turn acute, short term emergencies needlessly into catastrophes in order to contribute immeasurably little to the mitigation of a long term problem.

1564155782295441409 2022-08-29 07:39:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MathiasSundin I just heard a BBC interviewer ask a planetary scientist the Moonshot v Cost-of-Living-Crisis question, and the only answer was the broken-window fallacy.  Of all the reasons for humans to do this wonderful thing, the BBC airs the only invalid one. Without challenge.
1563981516992139264 2022-08-28 20:07:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Alternating Current has already achieved that very thing. Air conditioning is also great, but I don't see how it could become *as* great.
1563959701603319810 2022-08-28 18:40:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MathiasSundin Yes it seems that my statement was premature!

1563921714282741762 2022-08-28 16:09:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen LOLOL.
1563905417591373825 2022-08-28 15:04:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToddBaum_ "Leave politics to the scientists" is scientism. Which is itself not a scientific theory but a political philosophy. One that advocates its own exclusion from the political sphere.
1563882295446183939 2022-08-28 13:32:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KraftAvi No one can test for every possible source of error. But if the reason you never checked for this one is that you irrationally trust robots, you have a bias.
1563881634012725248 2022-08-28 13:30:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KraftAvi No. If no one knows that dud light bulbs roll farther, and your robot for randomly testing them takes them from one side of the conveyor belt, you will overestimate the failure rate. That's a selection effect not a bias.
1563875347099258884 2022-08-28 13:05:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @snchou0 If you're going to imagine a physically impossible demon, why bother to tell him all the laws of physics, initial conditions, and make him deduce things? Why not just give him a complete list of everything that happens, past, present and future?
1563800528173268993 2022-08-28 08:07:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @snchou0 The world is deterministic down to the lowest level. But "in principle derivable" depends on which principles you want to rely on. Nothing can predict the content, nor the effects, of future knowledge creation:  https://t.co/PKd0IApd3Y
1563615066473508865 2022-08-27 19:50:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> A selection effect is not a bias (i.e. not a chronic defect in thinking). It is a form of systematic error. It is only neglected when one is unaware of all the relevant conditions affecting one's observations.  https://t.co/314VTpI9M5
1563548189923622917 2022-08-27 15:25:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But none of the policies they advocate are claimed to have that effect.
1563547081154764800 2022-08-27 15:20:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In regard to policies to address the 'cost of living', is it intended that the country's annual energy consumption will remain unchanged?  Politicians and commentators are all speaking as though it is.
1563177490897444864 2022-08-26 14:52:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Marwyn72 @HumanProgress Happiness isn't measurable. So any measurable quantity that someone calls "happiness" isn't happiness.  Lifespan, in contrast, is measurable.
1563146560464384005 2022-08-26 12:49:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Ditto. Not sure about related issues such as what happens to conserved quantities like baryon number. But it seems promising there too.
1562864060529778689 2022-08-25 18:06:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @laraghavan Thanks I'll ask.

1561673103159197697 2022-08-22 11:14:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @heikkiarponen And the L1 point is unstable anyway. But these are not insuperable problems. See their article  https://t.co/ed51PUKb5Q!  However, I think it would be very unwise to try to use only a single method to control the temperature.
1561374172776996865 2022-08-21 15:26:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Yes, so trusted mainstream people out there should not only refuse to participate in it, but gently ridicule it.
1561314390066008064 2022-08-21 11:28:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Bernard22190947 But furthermore, many realise that the real root cause is an increase in human welfare and wealth. So they think in terms of reining that in. That's not inevitable, though.
1561021500395847680 2022-08-20 16:05:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PaulRBerg I hope @ARIA_research can make a start.

Like, has anyone investigated floating millions of white objects in places where the Arctic Ocean has melted?

1560967747407937537 2022-08-20 12:31:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @magneticnord I'd have applied to do some safe, incremental research in a well-established field.  Support should be via individual group leaders with impressive records, who then choose their own people, who in turn choose their own topics in consultation with those leaders. Flat hierarchies.
1560963339085307907 2022-08-20 12:13:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Denisovich021 A cluster of structural irrationalities very much does. For instance, committees are inherently biased against novel research directions.
1560959052246646784 2022-08-20 11:56:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> A couple of years ago I spoke to a member of the panel that awarded me my first research grant on quantum computers (1985). He said it was a close-run thing. I asked if I'd have got it under today's criteria. He said: no chance; basically I could tick none of the boxes.
1560625940358696960 2022-08-19 13:53:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Definitely.
1560614854435782656 2022-08-19 13:09:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed, one-on-ones are great and don't need round tables.  But I don't think reluctance to speak is the main problem with them. It's reluctance to participate in a purposeless exercise.
1560209331936706560 2022-08-18 10:17:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Shameful.
1559928324885037056 2022-08-17 15:41:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @IAgreeDude @dela3499 That is a matter for the philosophy of personal identity, not quantum physics.
1559915786743025665 2022-08-17 14:51:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @paul_snively @dela3499 I read some sections. It is the definitive work on Everettian quantum theory. I disagree with little of it.
1559912131923001349 2022-08-17 14:36:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Yes, according the quantum theory as best we know it today. Though 'can' and 'however rarely' refer to arbitrarily extreme situations.
1559600074132537345 2022-08-16 17:56:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NegDiscountRt @reasonisfun Is that on the assumption that having problems is the same as suffering? That there are no wonderful, energising, fulfilling, unsolved problems?
1559566978607714304 2022-08-16 15:45:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KyivIndependent One of these things is not like the others.

1558339297106923521 2022-08-13 06:26:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aniketvartak Yes new ideas are created by thought, in response to problems new and old. Solutions cause new problems. Tools don't think.
1557723559325474817 2022-08-11 13:40:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ARIA_research @ilangur I don't think roundtables are what's needed. They tend only to amplify existing patterns of thinking, perhaps under new names.
1557692245217779713 2022-08-11 11:35:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's about using microwaves (or plasmas) for drilling, not for actually extracting the geothermal energy. Still cool though.
1557266242892873730 2022-08-10 07:22:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Atom2384 Nothing to do with state v federal: before the new ruling, it was not subject to a federal political process either.
1557261960680542209 2022-08-10 07:05:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Atom2384 It returns it to a political process.
1556999403797364737 2022-08-09 13:42:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @david_hurn In both cases.
1556997519544123400 2022-08-09 13:35:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> There's a growing movement opposing the production of newborn babies too. Admittedly I haven't heard the argument "because they could be used for military purposes", but perhaps that will come.
1556993275092926464 2022-08-09 13:18:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This seems to be the Prof Weizenbaum who wrote ELIZA, worried about AI, and wrote a book saying that AGI is impossible. If so, his pessimism on home computers is interesting: he’s assuming they will be used for writing programs:  https://t.co/SL0jl21jOP
1556785818865483776 2022-08-08 23:33:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Brokencastles1 @SStruhar It's a mistake to judge ideas by their proponents, and even more to judge them by the supposed hidden motives of their proponents. We should judge ideas in their own right, as explanations.
1556667745374244864 2022-08-08 15:44:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Great! But what is the explanation? And what was the mistaken explanation on which the forecasts were made?
1556630163475030017 2022-08-08 13:15:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan And in the case of food, can this be done without "bankrupting farmers"?  (I suppose the answer is yes, but I'm not familiar with the situation.)
1556615680581144577 2022-08-08 12:17:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EdwardFarrelly I agree tariffs were a bad example, since they are a tax/subsidy. I meant regulations.  Regulations were not all optimised to minimise people's health risks. They were instituted for all sorts of reasons, some of them not as urgent as the current cost of living emergency.
1556234065732313090 2022-08-07 11:01:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Entity3Self @mishtal Not really. For some time now, certain secular political ideologies have been at least as bad as religion was in Pascal's day, in making people do evil completely and cheerfully.

1554520005013905408 2022-08-02 17:30:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @vgr I don't think so. Every point is a growth point.  What stops people pursuing it is that it doesn’t interest them. They'd rather do something else, and why is that a problem for anyone, or for civilisation?

1554420128288329728 2022-08-02 10:53:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mormo_music Yes but the immoral thing there is unrelated to declining to force-feed yourself. It's intentionally depriving your shipmate for no good reason.
1554411305712472064 2022-08-02 10:18:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @maxmulitz @mormo_music Indeed. For 'train' substitute 'force-feeding machine'.

1554030699279155200 2022-08-01 09:06:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @arjunkhemani It doesn't require sabotage for errors to go uncorrected. Sometimes a false idea can be long-lasting because it seems plausible within the holders' problem-situation, and the proponents of better ideas haven't yet thought of better arguments against it.
1554028372480737280 2022-08-01 08:56:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Just as there is no such thing as wasting your fire extinguisher *by not setting fire to your house*.

1551912413519384578 2022-07-26 12:48:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> People don’t seem to remember how inflation ruins everything. Not just the cost of living and people's life savings—everything. Sunak is assuming everyone knows what he's referring to so he doesn’t spell it out, but speaks instead of credit cards.  Truss—doesn't seem to remember.
1551301800887783432 2022-07-24 20:22:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> No. It's not a racial impurity. Just an error.
1551287902587453441 2022-07-24 19:27:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @keithwoolcock But Realpolitik is itself a moral philosophy and a bad one. It's often used to justify or condone bad international behaviour and to condemn good.  Often it's combined with moral relativism, ostensibly neutral, whose dark logic always ends up siding with wrong against right.
1551216399200157698 2022-07-24 14:43:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yudapearl @artistexyz @paul_snively 'Potential outcomes' that have knowable probability are all actual outcomes according to Everett. But even setting Everett aside, they are different from counterfactuals in your or constructor theory's sense. E.g. '*If* you did that, X would happen'.
1551154946845937669 2022-07-24 10:38:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yudapearl Popper says that subjective interpretations of probability aren't viable, and hence that framing the growth of knowledge as an increase in the subjective probabilities (credences) of true theories isn't viable either. Events can have probabilities; general theories can't.

E.g. slavery apologists used this argument in the 'wage slave' trope, also used by Marxists.

1539626522394476553 2022-06-22 15:09:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HiFromMichaelV Yes educational systems and practices are rife with anti-rational memes. (Much more than e.g. science.) But they are not the only sources of error.  Popper didn't come easily by his refutation of the bucket theory. Truth is hard to come by, even when no evil agency conceals it.
1539621015566917634 2022-06-22 14:47:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HiFromMichaelV Not all error is irrational. For instance, if people think in terms of the bucket theory they may well favour coercive education and hence set up irrational institutions.

1539605819825741824 2022-06-22 13:46:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SteveBiermanMD It's about error, not power. So is history.

But I'd be skeptical that irrationality in *individuals'* minds contributed directly to the suppression of ideas. And the *system* is irrational because of innocent but devastating philosophical errors such as the bucket theory of knowledge.
1539572201967550465 2022-06-22 11:33:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I guess it is just a widespread, tragic error, but yes, entrenched and perpetuated by the chronic institutional irrationality which suppresses fundamental ideas in favour of incremental, and which I have often complained about in physics and other fields I have worked in.

1530805414278975489 2022-05-29 06:57:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Sort of. But following Popper, it's important to avoid utopianism.

The grim fact is that to those whose priority is to legitimise hurting Jews, the status quo, though not optimal, is acceptable. They reject whatever reduces that legitimacy.

1516882265028108288 2022-04-20 20:51:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tzaffi Quite possibly. The context I was referring to was unrelated to that, namely a society in which everyone is familiar with fear and shame being inflicted the name of education.
1516861254186450946 2022-04-20 19:27:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @marcnjen @TOKphysics Yes but that would be an inhomogeneous cosmology and assuming homogeneity makes many calculations tractable and there's no evidence against it…

1515634356387299332 2022-04-17 10:12:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Furthermore, at least one side in every controversy (not just political parties but every pressure group too) is objectively right about their opponents' most plausible arguments being harmful.  "Legal but harmful" is therefore not a sufficient reason to de-platform ideas.
1515634354986401792 2022-04-17 10:12:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Every politician in government thinks that the Opposition's policies would be harmful if implemented. The most plausible arguments for voting for the Opposition are therefore harmful too. The Opposition thinks the same of the Government's policies.

Or even their own: when you think you intend X, you may be mistaken.  So, guessing f and X isn't the best one can do: one can set up error-correcting institutions as well.

The accusation of Nazism seems not to be either: it doesn't seek to legitimise hurting Jews for being Jews, e.g. it doesn't take the form "isn't is ironic that a Jew is now the chief Nazi".

1500488428080836614 2022-03-06 15:08:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ThomasHarrigan8 The question seems to assume that a policy of increased immigration can only be implemented by giving citizenship to the entire population of the world.

1499472823781412872 2022-03-03 19:52:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That said, it is not just an invasion (which would be bad enough). It is an aggressive war, i.e. one not justified by self-defence:  https://t.co/xbChr6ZOYo
1499472622052118529 2022-03-03 19:51:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed this is an especially bad time for hyperbole.

1498390684579074060 2022-02-28 20:12:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @omriceren The very term 'NATO enlargement' is a concession to moral inversion. As though NATO tanks first rolled over those countries and subjugated them. As though those countries weren't seeking admission because of their people's well justified fear, which was not fear of NATO.
1498303714452516870 2022-02-28 14:26:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JOIsWraith A Popperian one I guess: error-correction…fallibilism…creativity. One can 'prove' that democracy can't work because the poorer half will vote to dispossess the richer; and the same for peace, because the violent feel as strongly as the peaceful. Yet they do work. Spectacularly.
1498300863726723077 2022-02-28 14:15:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @InvisibleGoril1 Strategising precisely isn't creativity. Strategising is the perspiration phase, not the inspiration phase.
1498294771915313154 2022-02-28 13:51:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @strazds Well, that's more like moral nihilism than moral relativism. But yes, they have a similar effect in practice.

1498291204370448389 2022-02-28 13:37:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Realpolitik/game-theoretic analyses of international affairs are seductive because in static situations they often expose truths. But where a lot of creativity is being applied, they are false. AND systematically lead to cynical moral/cultural relativism and to siding with evil.

1498038661727858689 2022-02-27 20:53:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @physicsmonk @SamoBurja For example, in every closed society there are individuals whose personal values are more typical of an open one. (And vice versa.)
1498027120114688010 2022-02-27 20:07:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SamoBurja No, there are such things as actual knowledge and actual ignorance. Valuing and not valuing truth. People everywhere make huge mistakes, but the West, including the West inside other civilisations, creates new knowledge.

1491493691634114564 2022-02-09 19:26:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Is this the only occasion in the history of warfare when a country has named a weapon "X-buster", where X is a place in a hostile country, yet everyone knows that it is not intended to harm anyone at X, but to murder the inhabitants of a third country?  https://t.co/QvDR1ZUKnW

Returning to Earth quite soon would be the objective in all but extreme scenarios.  In which case underground would do.
1490633241094668289 2022-02-07 10:27:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Good explanation of good explanations. With very nice, clear, persuasive examples.
1490443490488197120 2022-02-06 21:53:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @james_burnett_ Spending money on them is less important than maximising the rate of increase of our wealth. And the depth and diversity of our knowledge.
1490443009594478596 2022-02-06 21:51:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @james_burnett_ That's not a good way to think about it. It's not a random process. The next one is already out there, with our date and time of death engraved on it.  Even if it were random, we don't know the probability.  Nor how many other existential threats await. Nor even *what* they are.
1490364145606217728 2022-02-06 16:37:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BarrenCloth Yeah in my terminology wealth is the set of physical transformations one is capable of causing. It includes knowledge but also tools, embodying knowledge.

1490352284286566405 2022-02-06 15:50:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If this had been found to be on a collision course with us – I hope we'd have enough wealth to deflect it. But how?
1490349209576480777 2022-02-06 15:38:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Atom2384 Yes. There's no simple or universal answer to what the law should be. For example, acceptable levels of risk change over time. Also different sources of danger are (sometimes rightly) assessed differently. And it depends on intangible and unmeasurable things.
1490341946170167299 2022-02-06 15:09:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Rauayat2 That's a way of putting it, yes.

1490330640805511177 2022-02-06 14:24:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Rauayat2 How would that natural inclination have evolved?
1490316370587828231 2022-02-06 13:28:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Rauayat2 As you imply, "you will die if you do that" is sometimes less effective than "I'll hit you if you do that". But this is an absurd state of affairs brought about by previous irrational behaviour.
1490313439541174280 2022-02-06 13:16:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Rauayat2 We shouldn't. And the downsides are even worse and more widespread in that case.
1490305484762587138 2022-02-06 12:44:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Why do some people feel so strongly about not getting vaccinated even when this has large downsides for them in other ways? This guesses some answers  https://t.co/VqkYUvjDSH Maybe—but another component of the explanation is that *enforcing* true ideas has a terrible downside too.
1490270475271999491 2022-02-06 10:25:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @n0tzer0sum People in different polities (and groups within a polity) behave differently in response to e.g. (1) disease threats and (2) government policies.  So it's not valid to consider different polities as different test subjects in a controlled experiment.
1490262188409380867 2022-02-06 09:52:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The hypocrisy and shallowness of those people is being exposed. But as for the policies themselves, we know little more about what would have been the right one than we did at the time. We will, but we don't yet.  No 'study' detects counterfactuals.

The ideal of a consistent, or near-consistent, mind is a bad one.  But there is such a thing as truth/knowledge, and putting it on a par with falsity/error is even worse.
1487035644538986500 2022-01-28 12:11:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @Conaw Related to what Bronowski called  “emotional subtlety and toughness” (the ability to think about emotive events without this necessarily evoking the behaviours that evolution had attached to those emotions). An ability that is essential for progress.

1486029529042800646 2022-01-25 17:33:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson Also, the idea that large-scale state violence against Jews did not begin in 1933 and required years of propaganda to gain broad public approval, is false. It can be used to label any government action one disapproves of as 'how Nazism started', which is Holocaust minimisation.
1486027078390722564 2022-01-25 17:23:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson Holocaust minimisation implies, for example, that 'The Jews' are today seeking privileges and illegitimate advantage by playing on the Holocaust. Which makes hurting them more understandable.

1483707182654889985 2022-01-19 07:45:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I did this, aged 11. My prior theory was that food fell from mouth to stomach under gravity.

I oppose compulsory vaccination but: the second is controversial because being vaccinated reduces the expected number of deaths of others.

Not necessarily in a brain: can be in books etc. or genes (See Popper's 'Epistemology without a knowing subject'). Not necessarily created by minds: can also be by evolution.

1475225652995497996 2021-12-26 22:02:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ThackerayZal Not an exception. Shakespeare, Jefferson, Churchill and Rowling all currently attract far more rage than him. Because uunlike them, he is not honoured for contributions to civilisation.
1475219190361567240 2021-12-26 21:37:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Most adults who died more than a century ago were criminals by today's standards. The ones singled out for 'cancellation' today are not those whose anachronistic crimes were worst, but those who are most honoured today for their contributions to civilisation.
1475205386223423491 2021-12-26 20:42:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @1954Sport @SPortoghesi Unless we choose otherwise.
1475203755717107712 2021-12-26 20:35:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SPortoghesi One gets a different answer if one re-does the calculation taking knowledge into account. E.g.  https://t.co/rhgdcH2Bky Turns out, the answer depends overwhelmingly on human decisions.
1475189804828610565 2021-12-26 19:40:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher @HiFromMichaelV Quite so.
1475188115019124736 2021-12-26 19:33:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher @HiFromMichaelV Even then, when Isaac Newton claims to induce his laws and not to make hypotheses, and Isamu Akasaki claims he just tried lots of possibilities, they are exaggerating the size of their philosophical mistakes. Like when religious people claim to have succeeded "with God's help".
1475131936305729544 2021-12-26 15:50:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Hostility to "Western" civilisation is not hostility to the bad past actions of Western nations. It is hostility to the values and aspirations that have made the present better than that. It is advocacy of a static culture:  https://t.co/9bEiqM2mPo
1475024912444272641 2021-12-26 08:45:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The world is indeed magic #smbc #hiveworks  https://t.co/uUEnuNQk3b But not even remotely magic enough. Even the bare minimum—to eliminate physical suffering—is still a work in progress.
1474618013534105603 2021-12-25 05:48:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes, the advice was jocular and no one, I guess, will follow it. But the underlying conception of knowledge and learning is no joke.
1474618012128927752 2021-12-25 05:48:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But in fact, that is not how learning works.
1474618010522591237 2021-12-25 05:48:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Or they'll learn that the Truth is already known to the Authority, and that the best way to teach it is to hurt someone.

1474302657686917136 2021-12-24 08:55:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reasonisfun Whether pessimism endures until it destroys us, cannot be predicted. But pessimism can end. If ye want that, it is no dream. That just follows from the rejection of the supernatural.
1474301351937167394 2021-12-24 08:50:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Will pessimism ever be effectively over?

1473901961711919108 2021-12-23 06:23:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In understanding time, the Page–Wootters approach is the way to go. But how to continue what they started…?
1473893891069911041 2021-12-23 05:51:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Even a genius's observations are thoroughly theory-laden!  In anatomy he was a lone pioneer, working in the near absence of a tradition of criticism.  In painting, there was much more of such a tradition.
1473814788396486660 2021-12-23 00:36:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich It's not self-evident that covid now is a long way from smallpox then. This should presumably be judged *relative* to the background level of suffering and death at the respective times.
1473727057465069571 2021-12-22 18:48:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Have to be cautious with this kind of thing. Perhaps not everyone at the time had a fully  modern conception of historical accuracy, with its sharp distinction between a good or edifying story and a true story.

1473339516131983362 2021-12-21 17:08:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen In some situations, that involves acquiescing in intrinsically bad or perverse policies because they cater to widespread misconceptions such as caring about income inequality.
1473338562745712643 2021-12-21 17:04:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen I try not to have preferences about aggregate outcomes, only about institutions. I want those to promote consent. I.e. I don't want to be a Philosopher King. The issue is how to facilitate people cooperating without violence despite disagreeing strongly.
1473078359072686085 2021-12-20 23:50:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Presumably a hangover from times when virtually all inequality of wealth was indeed caused by institutionalised theft, or worse.  But *why* it has hung over is indeed curious.

1472926480170631169 2021-12-20 13:46:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen (And hence one needs terminology that, at least, doesn't define the distinct physical properties 'no-signalling' and 'local realism' identically!)
1472836247701889024 2021-12-20 07:48:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen (Namely that every possible theory with reversible dynamics and a no-signalling theorem, also satisfies local realism.)
1472835682695536644 2021-12-20 07:46:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Ah. Yes indeed. The terminology needs to be tightened after this amazing discovery:  https://t.co/3kbyNWYocf

1471577172787838977 2021-12-16 20:25:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen I use the terms 'goal-oriented' and 'problem-oriented' very differently from each other. A goal being a predetermined problem and criterion for its solution. I'd call the attitude to research Atiyah describes utterly problem-oriented.
1471561477555425280 2021-12-16 19:22:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The 'non-adversarial' seating arrangement has failed to make them non-adversarial?

1470885452324511745 2021-12-14 22:36:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @antonhowes Still too strong a requirement. Because, as Popper said: "it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood: there will always be some who misunderstand you."

Continuing that protest would have been irrational. Continuing it because politicians were caught doing so, completely crazy.  And seatbelts don't even protect others.

1469263895122661376 2021-12-10 11:13:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed.  We need to hear from critics of the consensus because they sometimes turn out to be right, and that's where all progress comes from.  Also because even when (more often) they are dead wrong, we don't understand why unless we can consider their case as they put it.

1467180948919918605 2021-12-04 17:16:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jmugan Yes: in constructor theory, a statement that a transformation that doesn't happen is possible is counterfactual.

1467169783166685186 2021-12-04 16:31:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @kfbanhart That would be the Prime Minister of New Zealand.
1467169507944845320 2021-12-04 16:30:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> A heroic attempt to address this issue experimentally.
1467166950400962562 2021-12-04 16:20:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> My guess it that, because of the prevalence of moral and cultural relativism, most people in the West would deny that "progressive western society is better than anything before it".  On the (irrelevant) grounds that affirming that would be arrogant, hubris, colonialist etc.
1467157578010574851 2021-12-04 15:43:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Seems like things have got embarrassingly  irrational in New Zealand. Or is it the whole world?

1466099967253221383 2021-12-01 17:40:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @maxviggo Of course. (Though of course their being irrational and ineffective is not a sufficient condition.)
1465832309278621702 2021-11-30 23:57:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @andrew_lilico Sure but wasn't that just a case of *breaking* a law; it had no element of attacking the constitution—bribing an MP, or threatening violence or destruction etc—or am I missing something?
1465769390033584130 2021-11-30 19:47:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Early, sketchy evidence about the omicron variant:  https://t.co/ZuD2HDOs6C Inadequate but hopeful (if you're fully vaccinated).
1465753635166597120 2021-11-30 18:44:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @andrew_lilico In regard to obeying it, yes. But even a law that is unjustly killing thousands of people doesn't justify violently overthrowing the existing institutions of consent, unless that was already justified for other reasons.
1465729542090285061 2021-11-30 17:08:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Quite so. And it means regarding not only opinions we don't like, but *laws* we don't like, to be legitimate and reformable only by consensual persuasion.

1465310187682676747 2021-11-29 13:22:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @crit_rat "The big misconception"? Well yes, but that presentation may cause another misconception. In fact energy travels *close to* the wire. So a normal lamp 1m away would indeed have to wait while the energy goes round the long way.
1465106519255617540 2021-11-28 23:53:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Luck, yes, but why absurd luck? And why not suddenly? Deaths are only ever a nonfunctional side-effect of a virus's replication: there's no selection pressure for lethality, and some against.
1464944981391593483 2021-11-28 13:11:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Being better than other countries ought to be a source of pride. And beneficial too. Naturally, success brings problems, but they are soluble.  https://t.co/0W1zv83Oeg

1462764928444604417 2021-11-22 12:48:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I don't think they do. 'Excess deaths' is just as vague as 'covid deaths' because it refers to a counter-factual number.  Everyone seems to be interpreting these data as confirming what they previously thought. But they don't. We don't know yet; we will, but we don't yet.
1462754374216732678 2021-11-22 12:06:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Excess deaths during the pandemic (scroll down: the second table is more interesting than the first IMO):  https://t.co/crANKe8WZ8

1462189449102737410 2021-11-20 22:41:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey Only in very special cases, I think. In a free society it is taken for granted that it is legal to harm other people provided one is acting within one's rights. For instance, I don't have to compensate my butcher if I turn vegan. But I do if I poison his meat, even inadvertently.

1460927363907301376 2021-11-17 11:06:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I can't praise this book enough. Gripping, hard-SF near-future story but much more. Deserves to be an epoch-making event. Can't say more without spoilers.
1460572796195590145 2021-11-16 11:37:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes indeed. A rule of thumb can contain valuable knowledge. Yet it is always fragile and often misleading or even deadly. Most importantly, without explanations it cannot be improved.
1459870067097804803 2021-11-14 13:05:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It is indeed a problem. However, the numbers may be skewed by the ambiguity of the word 'useful'. Many researchers in archaeology, mathematics, mediaeval music etc. feel it inappropriate to describe their research as useful because that has a connotation of narrow practicality.
1459816300797169667 2021-11-14 09:31:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @thatfollowed It's a mistake to classify chess payers and mathematicians as 'wasting their time' on 'addictions'. If someone is peacefully solving problems, there can be no mechanical criterion for second-guessing them. If you guess someone may have a bad problem, offer them a better one.
1459432527526080516 2021-11-13 08:06:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. And both of them are, qua mental processes, indistinguishable from scientific research.

1454033798086209537 2021-10-29 10:34:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's conventional wisdom that Emily Davison's suicide by throwing herself in front of the King's horse convinced some people previously opposed to women's suffrage to change their minds.  How would that have happened? Didn't the stunt, rather, retard that progress?
1453813267697217549 2021-10-28 19:57:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @arithejealous Several interventions have been proposed that would uncontroversially cool the atmosphere. They may have side-effects, but AFAIK no supercomputers are trying to predict those. But unprecedented interventions in the world economy, with unknowable effects, are being implemented.

1453719071594188807 2021-10-28 13:43:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @arithejealous Yes. Namely, the claim that it will be in the foreseeable future depends on the inexorability of an tipping point, but  https://t.co/TPloHvBe2N
1453685348270284810 2021-10-28 11:29:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @emilioferrucci A tipping point is calculated on the premise that the only subsequent human intervention would be emissions reduction. Which is unrealistic.

1452773583554547712 2021-10-25 23:06:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In principle it could be that 0 people know it, but it is still well known because many people know where to find it. Knowledge without a knowing subject.

1452647583734718466 2021-10-25 14:45:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aryehazan Just that some people think that their criterion for shutting down roads wouldn't, if generally adopted, lead to a permanent shutdown of roads, because their grievance is the last one that will ever arise because there is universal agreement on everything else that's important.
1452629581446500355 2021-10-25 13:34:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Wait – never mind injunctions. Why isn't gluing oneself to the road criminal damage?
1452628812127158273 2021-10-25 13:31:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @harryjdlowther Anything could. But it's not a matter of probabilities, it's a matter of where the problem leads.
1452287295764193286 2021-10-24 14:54:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. To be exact: hurting.
1452214141427589121 2021-10-24 10:03:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The posters are unusually explicit in their focus on de-legitimisation. And TfL are keen to stress that they're removing the posters for unrelated reasons.
1451889857740017666 2021-10-23 12:34:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Kaiwingchun In my opinion, curricula are inherently bad. What one learns next should not be determined by some schedule invented in advance by someone else for reasons of theirs, but by one's own problem-situation.
1451586232354578460 2021-10-22 16:28:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HiFromMichaelV Yes I've read some of The Origin of Species. Great writing. But it's addressing a very different problem-situation from mine. I don't need to be persuaded of evolution by natural selection nor to be acquainted with his evidence. Both are much better understood  now. Read Dawkins.
1451565701249052684 2021-10-22 15:06:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @antonhowes Yes. Yet if one says "imperialism was economically harmful" without attributing the idea to Adam Smith, one seems to claim it for oneself. But if one does cite him, one must read, and comment on, not only him but also the literature disputing that claim about his opinion. Tricky.
1451559017873084418 2021-10-22 14:40:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I haven't read the seminal papers of Maxwell, Einstein, Schrödinger or Heisenberg.  Their own ways of expressing their theories are far inferior to more recent ways.

1451142030567092234 2021-10-21 11:03:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Normally I'd side with IEA takes on things, but I think Dr Deepti Gurdasani won this debate   https://t.co/TuI830rxYj (from about 5 mins in to about 35).
1450853072197099526 2021-10-20 15:55:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DrRichardPitre Traditional information theory quantifies information in terms of probabilities or ensembles, but never says what it is in terms of basic physics. Constructor theory does:  https://t.co/6Qio89ucow

1448660207349874706 2021-10-14 14:41:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aryehazan Which was, I suppose, unfortunate for those with low incomes and many daughters, in a monogamous, urban, stratified society. Like Tevye the milkman.
1448652416237199360 2021-10-14 14:10:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aryehazan Main factors: polygamy and economic value of women's work, both tend to brideprice. Social stratification tends to dowry.  But it's complicated! Some societies even have both.

1447908215371481092 2021-10-12 12:53:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis My take: How a free-market economy works is beyond detailed understanding. (If one understood it, one could second-guess it.) But what it is, is understandable. It is a self-improving collection of imperfect institutions of creativity and consent.
1447251939633340427 2021-10-10 17:25:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen A good reason might be: being poor with a family to support, one may prefer low-risk, low-reward work over risky research one thinks important and would love to do.  Perhaps in some sense there aren't bad reasons after all. I wouldn't want to second-guess anyone's life decisions.
1447243804734545927 2021-10-10 16:53:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen I guess it's hard to do even when it comes to allocating one's own time and effort. Again, sometimes for good reasons. But often not.
1447136130747469828 2021-10-10 09:45:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen It's not nuts. It's common sense. Doing good requires knowledge. Rational funders should fund what they, more than anyone else, think should be done.

'Fun', in the sense of consistency between all those, need not involve feeling that one is having it.

1446067980094382084 2021-10-07 11:00:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @vlada_mc @ToKTeacher It would flatly contradict quantum theory as currently (or in any current proposal) formulated.

1445519058741317641 2021-10-05 22:39:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Truthcoin Research funding should be diverse, with funding entities having conflicting criteria.
1445488880484974598 2021-10-05 20:39:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If this problem is to be solved, it will be solved by ideas. Q will follow. Perhaps discontinuously. Perhaps going down before it goes up.
1445488874587758592 2021-10-05 20:39:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And let me add a methodological point: Framing research in terms of increasing a number, such as Q_plasma or Q_total, rewards incremental-type research and penalises more fundamental, idea-based research.

1442113460490301441 2021-09-26 13:06:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson Good question. I suppose that society will increasingly face that sort of problem. I doubt there's a general answer for what to do. But there's some excellent knowledge about what not to do.
1441753318544470017 2021-09-25 13:15:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson Right. But I don't think this is a common problem except where coercion is responsible for their not 'wanting' to. By parents, clerics, or the government. People naturally assimilate if they are allowed to, and thus there is a voluntary exchange of cultural ideas.

1434457595721490434 2021-09-05 10:05:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Finding causal theories is necessary but not sufficient. We need *explanatory* theories. "Mosquitos cause malaria" is essential and useful but only 1% of the way to understanding and curing malaria.
1434457594417004551 2021-09-05 10:05:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And good explanations are hard to come by. Not zillions. We are lucky if we have one. 2-3 is great, and only then do experiments and observations (data) become relevant, to chose between them.
1434457592655384586 2021-09-05 10:05:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Because being logically compatible with empirical data is not what we should be seeking. We want a good explanation of the world (the 'data' might be wrong).

1434409718425047041 2021-09-05 06:55:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This is especially important in fields like economics, history and AGI which are largely about knowledge, because there IS NO predictive theory of the outcome. And yet causal relationships can be discovered, by researchers/AGIs, by explanatory conjecture and criticism.
1434409717107994626 2021-09-05 06:55:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The way out of the circularity problem is not to adopt a convention but to drop empiricism. In fact, both causal models and the right counterfactuals (and what 'data' to measure) are derived from explanatory theories which are not derived from anything but boldly conjectured.
1434409715832852484 2021-09-05 06:55:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> One thing is: there are NEVER ANY "secure, scientifically unimpeachable means for sorting out which if any of the many hypotheses about that world is correct." Nor 'probable'. So that isn't the problem.

1433819192231333901 2021-09-03 15:48:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I think this must mean that they expect *unknown* harms to exist, and that this fact tips the balance. But there can be unknown harms of not vaccinating too. You can't derive knowledge from ignorance.  Make it voluntary.

Some people have found it so. But nothing is fun for every human at every moment in their life. So if it's not fun for you right now, maybe it will be one day.

1422225154155978762 2021-08-02 15:57:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DryRoastPeanuts @royalsociety Yes, sorry, it's the host institution. I was thinking of a case where that's also the home institution. Either way, it tends to disqualify the very people who have the most relevant knowledge from being the one referee that is now permitted.
1422188931408449540 2021-08-02 13:33:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Yes; conversely, it is intense pressure to live the standard career, form the standard relationships, move around in standard ways etc.

1422171884016357384 2021-08-02 12:26:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. Another reason is that few new ideas sound right to the mainstream. So the more innovative an idea is, the fewer people are likely to be able to judge a candidate's potential to take it forward. And those people are most likely to be from the candidate's home institution.
1422164724020563978 2021-08-02 11:57:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It seems the @RoyalSociety has changed its rules for applications for postdoc research grants: one can now only nominate one referee, who can't be from the applicant’s home institution.

Only his passion for reducing human suffering and his fantasies of hurting people on a massive scale to achieve that, remained unchanged.

1417473108370407432 2021-07-20 13:14:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 All. It's just fallibilism.  A counter-intuitive consequence of it that happens to contradict most ideas of what motivates people.

So it's not an offensive song but it contains severe misconceptions, and forcing people to sing it is offensive.

1404334738903646209 2021-06-14 07:07:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tytung2020 Indeed. But in a game of he-said-she-said, how should one judge between that claim and, say, this one?  https://t.co/aApAONBP84  One has to go by *explanations* first, and evidence (especially anecdotal) second.

1404090070689206273 2021-06-13 14:55:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> E.g. I think liberal democracy is extremely stable and the Weimar Republic was unstable because it wasn't a genuine implementation of one.
1404090068986384386 2021-06-13 14:55:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I think it's more that political institutions are largely inexplicit, so what it means to "implement" one isn't simple.

1403287507479977986 2021-06-11 09:46:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hounkaiku I recall a Labour MP saying it but being widely criticised. However, the Labour government at the time was busy killing selective schools for alleged elitism.

OTOH maybe we can do without both inflation and dark energy! 😉 And anyway, contrary to widespread belief, science isn't about simplicity.

They have to be expressed in terms of anomalous immunities and exceptions to Enlightenment values. E.g. the "right to chastise" and of course the tragically stultifying bucket theory of the mind.

One deflects them by detecting them years in advance and then sending out probes to nudge them. I can't imagine that being an accidental side-effect of adaptations for coping with frequent occurrences.
1400185598846119953 2021-06-02 20:20:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal One reason is that asteroids are too rare to exert differential selection pressure on genes that do or don't have such adaptations.

But  that the IDF's method of stopping them would only be legitimate if it killed more Jews.  That's a time-honoured theory of morality.  Ignoring that the IDF's present method spares more civilians than any other army ever.

Later he said, rightly, that it will go on until Hamas gets itself a new ideology. Such things do happen, often unexpectedly, often rapidly.

(Incidentally, the Palestinian movement considers every Jew anywhere in Israel "the settlement movement".)  But Religious Zionists don't control either the law or the legal system.
1393892234903408640 2021-05-16 11:33:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SPortoghesi @EVKontorovich It may seem obvious a priori that that must be the truth, but actually it's a persistent anti-Israel trope. Israel was founded by radical secularists, mostly left wing, many of them atheists. Religious Zionists have not been in the ascendancy there, then or now.

The practice of systematically suppressing both good and the bad ones (and there is no automatic way of distinguishing them) systematically prevents progress.

We did all the things we knew can facilitate progress. Yet none of our conjectures improved the problem.  OK even that's a kind of progress. But I think it's not what Naval meant.

Is the idea that if the pathogens take a long time getting here they will die en route? How can we know that?  We'd do better to devote creativity to creating general-purpose cures for infections than to banning research.

1386661505773494281 2021-04-26 12:40:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sawaahiliy The idea that initial conditions are fundamental is an artefact of the prevailing (i.e. non-constructor-theory) conception of laws of physics. Yet rarely final conditions. And never last Tuesday's.  In constructor theory, conditions at all times are equally non-fundamental.

1382101897662840845 2021-04-13 22:42:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TheDavidSJ "Perceived" is a different issue. Because of the myth, we interpret it as looking flat because we mentally edit out all deviations from flatness, or use a no-true-Scotsman argument that could classify anything as 'flat'.

1382043821916225537 2021-04-13 18:51:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "Focus on the funnel." Yes! But prior to the funnel come crucial ideas of philosophy (like the "improving mentality") and, increasingly, the products of blue-sky fundamental research.

Also the problem of qualia isn't just what other people's are like. It's also how to predict them.  And explain, of course. Vastly more is known about the natural numbers (an infinite set!) than the quale yellow.
1382001356823793665 2021-04-13 16:02:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I think this work is very important. @antonhowes' "improving mentality" is close to what I call optimism.
1381874969404178432 2021-04-13 07:40:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @OptimalBayes @mynameisChesto Not two. Other structure is taken for granted—time, an infinite rectangular array with values 0 &amp; 1, etc. They are 'simple' rules relative to the laws of physics. Relative to other abstractions they're complex, intractable or non-computable.  They pop up everywhere, like clothes.
1381867668312051716 2021-04-13 07:11:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @OptimalBayes @mynameisChesto It's the world that's surprising, not mathematics. Among all those formal systems, only extremely unusual ones would describe a world in which they (and many others!) can be understood.
1381859376999305217 2021-04-13 06:38:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mynameisChesto I think there are physical things, abstractions, and qualia, but unfortunately that's not what Popper meant by his three worlds so I haven't found his classification helpful. Abstractions such as the natural numbers aren't physical but exist even when not physically instantiated.

If in a school, it might merit exemption because various forms of it are based on philosophies or religions.  The article quotes a Scientist as calling it retuning our brains.
1378730267360292864 2021-04-04 15:24:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Compulsory brain-tuning sessions.  Will there be a religious/philosophical exemption from them?

In this case I doubt that any 'discipline' is justified, except perhaps of the parents and teachers by each other.

The British government and media in the 1920s-30s withheld evidence from the public that Germany was massively rearming. Churchill was not allowed on the BBC. Arguably this was a significant cause of WW2 and tens of millions of deaths.

1375794401889370112 2021-03-27 12:58:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson Values such as liberalism are a property of traditions which limit, for instance, how illiberal a democracy can get.  When a government acts to preserve traditions with that function, that's not illiberal. It's the core of what it currently means for a society to be liberal.
1375793440814944260 2021-03-27 12:54:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson In a sense the very existence of government is illiberal. But one of its functions that it is not yet known how to improve on is that of sovereignty over borders.
1375721961783975936 2021-03-27 08:10:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aekert I just think it might help to flag the perversities to avoid confusion later. Just as you flag that AB means 'do B, then A', you could mention that probability is a fudge, and that Schrödinger-picture 'amplitudes' can be misleading, and yes, that quantum networks aren't circuits.
1375717475174744065 2021-03-27 07:53:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aekert Yes. It is brilliantly focused on what people who want to join the quantum computation research community *want to know*, namely what quantum theory says about computation. And in the language and conceptual framework *actually used* in the community, even where that's perverse.

1375019969747034117 2021-03-25 09:41:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Beautiful. And spot-on about the difference between formulae and explanations. But I think there's more to a conservation law than the forces that implement it. It holds for other kinds of force too! All kinds. It's a law about laws.

No way would Spanish shipbuilders have focused on how to win land wars. Losing a naval battle to better ships would have made them try to think of better ships—unless it didn't for some powerful reason.

Except it didn't. So the question is, what slowed down that effect?  It can only be anti-rational memes, but I mean which ones specifically?

Tasking courts to adjudicate this among politicians would be a catastrophe.  Laws against libel, fraud, incitement etc. must suffice.
1372125288570703878 2021-03-17 09:58:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CipV9 We should make systems and institutions as stable as humanly possible *subject to* not destroying the means of correcting errors in those systems and institutions and elsewhere.

At most you could mean 'socially useful' = on a timescale of your hindsight, they've become well funded but weren't initially.  BTW I know several things I thought initially would never work but were funded and ended up working extremely well.

I'm not an evolution theorist but I guess germline cell adaptations are therefore judged differently from others.

1371124445742518274 2021-03-14 15:41:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm As I use the terms:  Knowledge in genes is non-explanatory.  Knowledge in minds can be explanatory or not, and there are more fine-grained categories like rules of thumb, anti-rational memes, and hangups.

1370345094902059012 2021-03-12 12:05:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Vampyricon @acapellascience Then why do we have to explain it in terms of the *initial* conditions? Why not the final or future conditions? The laws of physics are perfectly reversible.
1370078898772381704 2021-03-11 18:27:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I think these ideas about the poisonous effect of meta-discussion within one mind may be very fruitful.

Sometimes one can try to solve them by making guesses at truths about the objective reality underlying the problem. There are such truths in political philosophy just as in other fields.

1369973583984918529 2021-03-11 11:28:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> 16,000 is an inaccurate estimate of the number killed in the Fukushima nuclear accident. The error is due to confusion between the nuclear accident and the tsunami that caused it.  A more accurate estimate is far lower: none from radiation; some who died in the evacuation.

1369572169852870659 2021-03-10 08:53:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @chloelixc When one makes a statement it is always vague i.e. could refer to many different abstractions. And it is never true i.e. some of those are false propositions. Errors beset every part of the relationship between statement and reality. Yet statements can instantiate vast knowledge.
1369297841315848199 2021-03-09 14:43:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @chloelixc A physical thing can refer to something, abstract or physical imperfectly. When I speak of Shakespeare I have a certain conception of him in my mind that is vague and contains errors but, I fallibly claim, refers to a real person. Same with the set of all integers.

1369203283580030977 2021-03-09 08:27:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Physburgh @michael_nielsen 'Higher level' explanations can be fundamental – can be unified with each other or with 'lower level' ones (e.g. in the quantum theory of computation). The 'higher/lower' classification is itself not fundamental. So 'depth is winning' doesn't mean 'non-emergent is winning'.
1369068234922725382 2021-03-08 23:31:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Influence rather than importance, perhaps. But alas, I know of important works that have made countless *subsequent* publications obsolete.

Others are good, bad or a mixture, and it's in the nature of things that people disagree at any given time about which is which.

So is my fictional Socrates' conjecture that "do not destroy the means of correcting errors" is the universal moral rule.  (Even if that's true, it's still not executable in all situations without a lot more explanation.)
1368514909940637699 2021-03-07 10:52:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sphexish Those are all rules of thumb that are accurate, and mutually consistent, in many situations. More generally, creativity is required to solve moral problems, and those rules become modes of criticism rather than executable instructions.

1364229592081399811 2021-02-23 15:04:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So, when asked a question that isn't about epidemiology, virology or public health research, the leading experts lead in different directions. That's exactly as it should be.
1364138709470298113 2021-02-23 09:03:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Demerzel6 @StefanoPortogh1 All of them?
1363988526853984258 2021-02-22 23:06:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @simon_fawthrop No. Whoever ordered this did not benefit personally.
1363977866065686529 2021-02-22 22:23:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @iamFilos *need education
1363970491548106752 2021-02-22 21:54:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @iamFilos I guess no one needs to be fined, fired or yelled at. But the process that caused the stunt must be prevented from ever happening again. Someone wanted to educate the public in dangerous falsehoods about the law. Turns out, it is some high-ranking police officers who need this.
1363966317628436485 2021-02-22 21:38:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The police apologised. Fine. But something went very wrong in the creation of that stunt and it needs to be put right.
1363897556456112129 2021-02-22 17:04:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Researchers are confident that the animal does not know it's a mammoth and that the minor cosmetic glitches will be rectified on the next attempt.
1363787350409678854 2021-02-22 09:46:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> He and Lovelace also failed to notice that electric relays, already in mass production at the time for telegraphy, would have made the task much easier. Nor, apparently, did their friend Michael Faraday. So—er—go figure.
1363619652446933001 2021-02-21 22:40:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SPortoghesi It's just that there's a truer way of understanding objective knowledge, due to Popper. We don't need bases, nor to establish anything. Those are chimeras.
1363594799291527175 2021-02-21 21:01:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @StefanoPortogh1 No, there is a sense in which every instance of consciousness is physical: it is instantiated in a physical object. Not so for every integer.
1363589938298703872 2021-02-21 20:42:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @StefanoPortogh1 In what sense is every integer physical?
1363537318536220678 2021-02-21 17:13:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @elmobronowski I think it's newly powerful enough to get innocent academics fired, make prestigious institutions ritually declare falsehoods true, etc.

1363512872513527808 2021-02-21 15:36:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen So you *have* gained something!  Also thoughts about science education &amp; journalism?  I think the main benefit for me is: realising why a bad idea is not just crazy but false, helps me understand good ideas better.  Sometimes cranks also have a point, among the misconceptions.
1363510043916857344 2021-02-21 15:25:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Those *ideas* have no place in science. They should be contradicted and disobeyed.  In regard to people, it's those who obey who are the problem, much more than those who issue such commands.
1363450472477192193 2021-02-21 11:28:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Cranks play a valuable role in science. Popular science magazines should occasionally give them a platform.  But that not what this is. This is a new authority speaking. One that should be disobeyed.
1363442115032862721 2021-02-21 10:55:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BernardMcCarty Maybe. But people in one culture are not in general morally obliged to conform to the values of another, even to avoid distress in the other.  I guess they only are when the 'paradox of tolerance' makes it inevitable.
1363266639827992581 2021-02-20 23:17:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Malcolm_Ocean It's a methodological rule. Not really a definition of 'real'. We can always be mistaken.
1363260956298670081 2021-02-20 22:55:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jeffreywatumull @Atrosto Existing educational traditions are inflexible. Have built-in assumptions about physiology—even struggle to assimilate people who only *look* different. What if a species was adult at 10? Died at 30? Spoke in howls? Of course there'd be ways. But we currently don't know how.
1363220419940134913 2021-02-20 20:14:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jeffreywatumull @Atrosto I think there are reasons other than the dubious Precautionary Principle, or any argument from ignorance, for not creating people for the purpose of observing them. Would be wrong to deform human babies to look like prehistoric species, for instance.
1363186366427856899 2021-02-20 17:58:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SkateAtDawn Because it's there.
1363184673875255300 2021-02-20 17:52:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Atrosto We can't yet know that their inborn software doesn't need species-dependent culture to start up properly.
1363181730765672449 2021-02-20 17:40:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Of course we should. Any species except those, like Neanderthals et al., who were capable of creating explanatory knowledge. That would be immoral.
1363162845995819009 2021-02-20 16:25:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Are the methods of science ways of knowing the answer to that question?
1362901073212682247 2021-02-19 23:05:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JeffBak73503675 @DKedmey Right.

1362541426534461443 2021-02-18 23:16:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> People are celebrating (or disparaging) technology. But what caused this is optimism: the idea that problems, though inevitable, are soluble.

1362426399236177926 2021-02-18 15:39:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @fwmm @ToKTeacher Without breaking existing laws? Yes.  BTW who are these people who want to preserve what they know to be errors?
1362423756723941381 2021-02-18 15:28:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I don't know enough to judge whether the particular case made here includes all relevant considerations, but I do agree that our culture doesn't take viral diseases (including Covid) as seriously as we should, and that pessimism is to blame.
1362373015829426176 2021-02-18 12:06:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @fwmm @ToKTeacher I don't think it does. Fake news is just error, not intolerance. No special intolerant measure is morally justified to combat it.

If you try, blind, you may well be doing something as perverse as "few black people have ever been successful in this field before".

1361290830926000131 2021-02-15 12:26:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CipV9 Indeed. The more diverse the criteria for getting funded are, the better.

1361054487616577539 2021-02-14 20:47:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nicklockwood But the answer to that version is obviously yes. Each sex typically has different preferences about their body parts and functions that are different in the other sex.  But, how those differences affect other preferences, depends on culture and individual choice and creativity.
1361050231308242944 2021-02-14 20:30:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ozgegunluk Among other things –  Self-awareness: doesn't cover inexplicit and unconscious knowledge. (Much explicit knowledge is in books and the internet.)  Teaching: "there is no such thing as instruction from without…" [Popper, slightly out of context].
1361024126421504000 2021-02-14 18:46:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "…an extraordinary feat - administering a total of 15 million jabs into the arms of some of the most vulnerable people in the country."  A year ago, who would have guessed that the Prime Minister would today be making resonant speeches about the nation's arms and feat?
1360982245461360641 2021-02-14 16:00:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I don't think self-awareness or teaching are primary or even necessary. Willingness to see an apprentice as a colleague can serve as well or better.

I assume people who made an honest mistake with the form won't even be charged. I don't know what to assume about intermediate cases.
1359473150719852544 2021-02-10 12:03:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CipV9 Yes. Not recognising that distinction is a chronic source of pessimism.
1359472658396626949 2021-02-10 12:01:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> An infected person going about their normal life should expect to infect about R other people.  And the same applies to those people.  What should be the maximum penalty for knowingly infecting someone?  I'm not saying I know, but that's the question being asked.

1359419487343190017 2021-02-10 08:30:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> One effect of the inquisition's anti-heresy campaign was that opposing it was by definition heresy. Then, opposing the classification of further ideas as heretical, was heretical. Runaway competitive hyperbole. Very few were actually punished. All were terrorised. Progress ended.

But that's still really a case of 'learning what the problem is'. Guessing and criticising explanations is still what it should all be about.

1355571932645744649 2021-01-30 17:41:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif @ToKTeacher @yaronbrook If a price is fluctuating about the correct value, then people who buy when it's too low and sell when it's too high make a profit and are damping the fluctuations.  Closer analysis proves that on average they are damping them if and only if they make a profit.
1355514294901866506 2021-01-30 13:52:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaronbrook @ToKTeacher So if they make money, they've harmed the economy by exploiting the flaw, but benefitted it by drawing attention to the flaw before some worse actor does?   And if they lose money, there's no issue, because they've borne the cost and been deprived of the ability to do this again?

Overlord didn't involve claiming publicly to be working for priority X while secretly working for Y. If it had, many people who joined up wanting X would find, when they were promoted to a given level, that they were being ordered to subordinate X to Y.

1354323454913372160 2021-01-27 07:00:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @alcap2015 "Who, whom", "Cui bono" etc., are bad ways of judging ideas. It's the fallacy of ad hominem.  The good way is to take no one's words at face value ("nullius in verba") and to develop criticisms of the content, not the source. E.g. "but if claim X is true, how can we explain Y?!"
1354320264310501376 2021-01-27 06:48:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich That's what often happens when one uses explanatory theories instead of extrapolating 'data'. And yet the former is the rational policy.

1353785097305075713 2021-01-25 19:21:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 By coincidence, the same holds for food: the opposite of "good" is "gone off".
1353705766369243137 2021-01-25 14:06:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan For example, no one yet knows how much of a genuine recession we're currently in, and how much of a mere hibernation. And how much of an impatient, pent-up, creative explosion. Especially given Brexit.

1353704695404122118 2021-01-25 14:02:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan Yes, and reasonable people may differ widely on where that point is.
1353677425666879489 2021-01-25 12:13:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan The evidence about that and other relevant issues isn't yet such as to make a particular policy choice the uniquely rational or moral one.

At the level of memes: remarkably alike but still different below the surface.  At the level of other ideas: very meaningfully unique, even when they seem similar.
1353642288510083072 2021-01-25 09:54:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @ScienceandLove It is to be expected that they seem to, if the differences are much greater than we can conceive.  There are powerful processes making us alike *in our interactions*. Interactions are the tip of the iceberg though.

1353611490373345281 2021-01-25 07:51:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> 1: This is pure common sense, and morality 101.  2: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox on its threshing floor.

With nuclear reactions, we see those because the energies are higher. And that's because the electrical energy being released has been pent up by nuclear force.

1352163382149971970 2021-01-21 07:57:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's full-on partisanship. Surely the complaint against the company should be that they claim otherwise.  Reasonable customers initially believe that they can post reasonable content and plan accordingly, and later suffer inconvenience and financial loss when they suddenly can't.
1352023326248628231 2021-01-20 22:40:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Exciting!
1351952920011538435 2021-01-20 18:01:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That, and the Blinken confirmation hearing, are very good signs.

1351545974083223556 2021-01-19 15:04:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes @jchalupa_ @RaymondIbrahim5 @JNS_org I don't think the atheist leftist feminist Jews who exclude other atheist leftist feminist Jews from their fellowship are religiously motivated. The issue is that the latter group don't endorse the legitimacy of hurting Jews for being Jews (enough).
1351526216428376065 2021-01-19 13:45:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes @RaymondIbrahim5 @JNS_org I don't think irredentism is a driving force in the War Against The Jews (or against Israel). It's merely one of many rationales, adopted opportunistically.
1351494170691719168 2021-01-19 11:38:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif Totally. Once one realises that empiricism is untenable, it becomes clear that the arguments for relativism in every field are isomorphic with those in science, and therefore untenable too.

1351404536783626241 2021-01-19 05:42:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes @RaymondIbrahim5 @JNS_org Surely not the explanation. There are plenty of irredentist causes in the world. Some very violent. A few, suicidally so. A few, genocidally so. But only one with massive legitimisation in the West.  That one irredentism is caused by the Pattern, not vice-versa.
1351295766975946759 2021-01-18 22:29:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @abettertake Not only easier. If that's the actual reason for doing them, the door to making them even easier, or positively good, is rarely closed.
1351289449586548737 2021-01-18 22:04:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cigaM_ @djgish It's specifically *political* culture and tradition, which were extremely different in those three countries, that are relevant to whether a country is vulnerable to dictatorships, revolutions, and coups.
1351115004934823946 2021-01-18 10:31:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @XiXiDu Yes, though nowdays, by a historic, admirable effort, they have converted the motivation from "Wir übernehmen die kaiserliche Würde" to the much less dangerous "Halten's uns z'rück!"
1351103325983436802 2021-01-18 09:45:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Turned out to have been a bad idea. Did anyone know how bad, at the time?
1351004550568824835 2021-01-18 03:12:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @InvestRepeat @naval And to the extent they aspire to be a Ministry of Truth, it's still up to the government – and hence the electorate – whether this 'ministry' will be given the power to enforce Truth violently.
1351000558920982529 2021-01-18 02:56:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @InvestRepeat @naval That is exactly what happened. And, in Bronowski's words, "The result was silence among Catholic scientists everywhere [and] a total stop to the scientific tradition in the Mediterranean".  But let's avoid hyperbole: the modern fact-checkers have no racks or stakes, only words.

The Global Slavery Index to which we were directed warns that  its published statistics on Arab states are probably a "significant underestimation of the extent of modern slavery in this region"  https://t.co/7tNvMrLaf5 but gives no such warning about Israel.
1350726855553384451 2021-01-17 08:49:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Incredible, and horrible, that the campaign for the creation of a Ministry of Truth is being led by the press, of all institutions.  Very few errors are as harmful to a free society as the forcible imposition of Truth.
1350718037381550080 2021-01-17 08:14:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes @pkmurthy1308 @afagerbakke Yes, but the issue starting this thread was whether Israel is best in the Middle East in terms whether members of the listed groups are safest there. It can happen that in a particular authoritarian state, some groups are safer than in a Western society. Has that happened here?
1350606062571970571 2021-01-17 00:49:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @pkmurthy1308 @richard_landes @afagerbakke Surprising. Thanks, I'll browse further.

1350577634095357952 2021-01-16 22:56:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes That's where one gets if one puts no value on safety, denies the distinction between good and bad, and opposes all progress, while calling oneself 'progressive'.
1350539831651282944 2021-01-16 20:26:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Nice illustrations!  Watch the whole talk here:  https://t.co/hacXp451lA  Or the whole debate, including audience questions, here  https://t.co/NHp7R8IyDQ
1350419888884637699 2021-01-16 12:29:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Blood libels against Jews are just one of the astonishingly resilient features of the Pattern, dating from well before the birth of Jesus.
1350369192273436674 2021-01-16 09:07:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DoqxaScott @JimiSommer The principle of optimism implies that there's always a way to reduce coercion incrementally while not destroying anything good. (Unless there are laws against incremental change!) We just need to create the requisite knowledge. Gradually.
1350069604740177924 2021-01-15 13:17:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HarvestRent @ernsterlanson Yes they are.
1350069474913890304 2021-01-15 13:17:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HarvestRent @ernsterlanson Yes there's a written tip of the iceberg, which is changeable by Parliament with a simple majority. But the unwritten part below the surface (which is very similar in Britain and the US) is what really prevents abuse of that power.
1350065987635339266 2021-01-15 13:03:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson It's much worse than an unwritten one. But the latter has to evolve; can't be conjured up at will. The Founding Fathers did miraculously well, retaining as much as possible. But it didn't prevent the Supreme Court from precipitating a civil war, and many lesser troubles since.
1350063975849930753 2021-01-15 12:55:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CipV9 = rule by un-removable judges. Governments not stating what they consider their best arguments for fear of falling foul of the Appointed Arbiters of Truth.
1350063230178258946 2021-01-15 12:52:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CipV9 Trouble is, everything carries that risk. It is never quantifiable. Including policies intended to reduce it. No system can prevent the really bad ones. So we're left with not exempting those policies from criticism, creativity and persuasion.
1350021036666970112 2021-01-15 10:04:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DoqxaScott @all_incorrect Right. And the 'ruler' would be 'the people' who, we should hope, can't be peacefully removed at all.
1350020632847724545 2021-01-15 10:02:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CipV9 Not with an electoral system, or any system. No good looking for anything infallible or 'likely to work' either. We're left, as always, with tradition, criticism, creativity and persuasion.
1349996410620567552 2021-01-15 08:26:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenTannenbaum1 It will be in the book.
1349988541548421120 2021-01-15 07:55:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @all_incorrect  https://t.co/Y5lDYcgkW9 In more detail, they are found, among many other powerful arguments against bad political ideas, in Popper's political writings.
1349972535815897091 2021-01-15 06:51:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> A system that enforces "*frequent*" elections gets closer to "direct democracy" in the sense of government by the people. I.e. by an imaginary person who can't be removed from government, ever. See  https://t.co/Y5lDYcgkW9
1349972534729596929 2021-01-15 06:51:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Thus, in British-type systems, a government calling an election at the wrong time is punished by the voters. Too soon risks being seen as trying to shift responsibility to the previous government, or the voters. Too late risks being seen as a pathetic attempt to cling to power.
1349972533198598145 2021-01-15 06:51:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Third, the *frequency* of elections should not be a property of  the system, but be determined politically, by what governments think gives them the most legitimacy.
1349972531650981890 2021-01-15 06:51:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Instead, in the traditional British system, a Government that has the confidence of Parliament cannot be overruled by anyone. It can only be brought down. The slogan that Truman put on his desk was a pious hope. In Britain it is baked into the system.
1349972530531098626 2021-01-15 06:51:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Second, delete "checks" and "balances". They are poison to responsibility. Every rule that prevents the Government from implementing what it thinks is right is an excuse for politicians and campaigners to obfuscate who is responsible.
1349972529373392898 2021-01-15 06:51:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Instead, in the traditional British system, a government that loses the confidence of Parliament falls on the same day and a General Election is typically held as fast as the rival campaigns can be set up. Campaigns are crucial. That's when persuasion happens.
1349972528148729856 2021-01-15 06:51:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> First, delete "obviously". Nothing is self-evident, and no system can reliably distinguish truth from falsity.
1349868690024620033 2021-01-14 23:59:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif @crit_rat That in a well functioning democracy the few are dispossessed by the many is a common (luckily not too common) misconception across the R-L spectrum.  It combines with class/ethnic/identity-struggle ideas to inspire violent fantasies of demographic disaster (R) or salvation (L).
1349858487770218497 2021-01-14 23:18:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @silasdenyer @Real_Adam_B @JonBatchelor8 @JohnDMC17 @SamCoatesSky @MrHarryCole BTW those things all violate Popper's criterion, to various extents.  'Who should rule' is a powerful intuition. Popper argues that it harmful. That's his conclusion, not his premise.
1349597327976230912 2021-01-14 06:00:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm @crit_rat Try searching Google for "Bush stole the election"  https://t.co/PlE7RQFfhk
1349512094312517634 2021-01-14 00:22:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @crit_rat So was I. A deplorable tradition has started up of the losing faction calling the election 'stolen' and the President illegitimate.  We may take comfort in the fact that Popper's criterion is about whether force is required to remove the leader, not whether he bitches about it.
1349459695749230593 2021-01-13 20:53:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> People convicted of conspiracy to commit murder are all kept together in prison? Why is that?
1349393676871598080 2021-01-13 16:31:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It was false, yes. But people in high places stating falsehoods  to promote a political agenda is nothing new and doesn't constitute the "death of truth", right?  https://t.co/EBDDfLW9D0
1349369606679502848 2021-01-13 14:55:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenTannenbaum1 I don't know. But I'm guessing it might help if people trying to combat it didn't do so in a way that mis-classifies it as a *form of* … all sorts of things that it sometimes causes but is rarely caused by. Such as hatred, prejudice, scapegoating, persecution of the Other, etc.
1349214996832657410 2021-01-13 04:41:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. Engineering is under-respected and the show is a greatly under-recognised tour de force. My favourite episode is Episode 2, but watch them all!
1349179789802942465 2021-01-13 02:21:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenTannenbaum1 "It's an addiction" doesn't explain the Pattern, nor does any other explanation that doesn't refer to Jews.
1349138532607135744 2021-01-12 23:37:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cubic_logic Are you referring to the Irish Sea "border" within the UK?
1349130358990790664 2021-01-12 23:05:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenTannenbaum1 No.  https://t.co/7MnIKD8jfk
1349123869228081155 2021-01-12 22:39:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Snusketeer @DrThorp3 Another ancient aspect of the Pattern is the invention of crimes of which Jews, exclusively, are accused. Like murdering God. Torturing the Host. Or in this case, not having vaccination drives in territories outside their jurisdiction.
1349119599938301962 2021-01-12 22:22:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DrThorp3 Of course it has. Citizens, and residents. The lie that it hasn't, has spread because of the prevalence of an ancient Pattern of eagerness to believe and spread such lies.
1349116858344083456 2021-01-12 22:11:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But they won't stop. Not until the Pattern does.
1348987284318785536 2021-01-12 13:36:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif @himura_k3nshin Nothing that stands up to quite simple criticism.
1348986898824486912 2021-01-12 13:35:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf>  https://t.co/PXRSNUnZek
1348986284837105664 2021-01-12 13:32:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif @himura_k3nshin Well, some of the very concepts that have underlain all studies into "anti-Semitism" prevent researchers from seeing what's in front of their noses. Such as the fact that the Pattern is by no means always manifested as hatred.
1348976939558711298 2021-01-12 12:55:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif @himura_k3nshin If x is *sufficiently* evil, yes. An immoral political/religious/etc movement or philosophy typically has a range of versions. The versions worse than a certain point always merge with the Pattern. No one knows why AFAIK.
1348888946915344384 2021-01-12 07:06:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Winter famine in the Netherlands!  https://t.co/cA4WIvrpHY Fear not, Britain helped out last time and it will now. Donate whatever sandwiches you can afford, to the Dutch embassy.
1348887862469677056 2021-01-12 07:01:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @2Philosophical_ Yes but that's true of anything. The term has gone viral with amazing speed because it has a meaning, as a metaphor or hyperbole, rooted in a certain political theory and expressing an allegation about the US and its people. That political theory, and that allegation, are false.
1348814813187756033 2021-01-12 02:11:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JimiSommer @himura_k3nshin I don't know. The vast literature on the subject of 'antisemitism' contains many explanations, few of which even address the issue AFAICT. Most have the structure 'anti-Semitism is a form of X', and never get round to explaining why, in that case, it's so unlike other forms of X.
1348733593724583938 2021-01-11 20:48:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @micahtredding @DoqxaScott The Holocaust wasn't caused by people getting swept up in random silly things. To explain it, one has to refer to attributes of culture that were *different* in the places where totalitarianism became a politically significant movement from those where it remained a fringe fad.
1348731866518532105 2021-01-11 20:41:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @himura_k3nshin Part of the Pattern is that anything that is sufficiently evil, turns against The Jews. That includes ideologies that violently oppose each other. Hence one can learn nothing specific about a particular evil faction from that characteristic alone.
1348727542015025153 2021-01-11 20:24:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reason_wit_me If there's any grain of truth in them, it can be expressed far better without minimising the Holocaust.   But there isn't. Reichspogromnacht was the manifestation of an instability in a radically different political culture.
1348720258060849157 2021-01-11 19:55:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed.
1348718840205750279 2021-01-11 19:50:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adilzeshan @dela3499 @aryehazan Not *uniquely*. The rest of the West has functioning institutions of criticism and consent too. But yes, that's what one has to recognise if one is not to mistake chalk for cheese.
1348603213784768515 2021-01-11 12:10:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aryehazan The explanation from which it is deduced has no tenable rivals that I know of. For instance, all rival explanations I know of provide no account of why such a thing hasn't happened in the Anglosphere since 1659.
1348601232865296386 2021-01-11 12:02:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The US is not, and will not be, a one-party state.
1348531727145328642 2021-01-11 07:26:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SamHarrisOrg I think maybe we disagree about what makes the difference between harmful and harmless hyperbole.  This is related to, but not, I think, the same as, the issue of when hyperbole (or metaphor) becomes lying.
1348529540340064256 2021-01-11 07:17:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @averykimball @MsMelChen @MirabelleW18 Hmm. That's flawed. It must be legal for a specialised platform to have a stated purpose, and to enforce on-topic rules like "say anything legal *about melons*", without automatically becoming liable for bad on-topic content. How could one frame a workable law with that property?
1348426734744576000 2021-01-11 00:29:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @averykimball @MsMelChen @MirabelleW18 To address that problem, the legislation might say: only if your policy is "on our platform you can say anything legal", are you not legally liable for what you do allow.
1348424701853446144 2021-01-11 00:21:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MsMelChen @MirabelleW18 Why not address the problem directly and  update the definition of incitement to violence to cover modern forms of that? But do it in the legislature where it can be debated and scrutinised properly, and modified when it doesn't work. Not in secret judges' chambers or boardrooms.

This is one of those issues where framing a problem in terms of "who? whom?" sabotages solving it, and makes it worse.
1348377151066828801 2021-01-10 21:12:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey It's about theories that predict that only one outcome of a measurement ever happens, albeit sometimes probabilistically.
1348374247312392200 2021-01-10 21:00:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey Interesting. I'm sure I could do a lot better now than then. For a start, I'd use the Heisenberg picture. And I'd stress that Bell's theorem isn't about quantum theory.

The rest are all about persuading people that you have a great project, and if they disagree, going back to the drawing board to improve your project. And one is about forcing people who think it isn't that great, to work on it anyway.
1348206487156490240 2021-01-10 09:54:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Radegund Exactly. The Prime Minister says we're throwing everything at this, and I hope that, despite appearances, this is so.

1347072236667232256 2021-01-07 06:47:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Sorry for the ambiguity. The first 'it' refers to 'you will die', and the last refers to the first becoming false.
1347067934028529665 2021-01-07 06:29:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Keep saying that, and eventually it'll be false.  I say 'it will, eventually', but on the timescale of astronomy, or of the biosphere, I really mean 'expect it almost instantly'.
1346997565536014343 2021-01-07 01:50:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Both are true. It's good for politics that some people are prone to hyperbole. It's good for science that some are cranks. But only if falsehoods, stated for any reason but especially by people who usually speak carefully, are contradicted before they go mainstream and  do harm.

1346978704623169538 2021-01-07 00:35:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis The rioters (and others) have indeed committed treason in the minds of their opponents. But not in law.  The criteria for treason are very narrow in the US, because the Founding Fathers knew factionalism easily leads to accusing political opponents of treason. Not just rioters.

"sewing used to be a manly activity". If that interests you, it's in part because it conflicts with an expectation.

1340625923872309248 2020-12-20 11:51:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Probability is a meaningless and misleading concept in situations of ignorance.

1340041257012387840 2020-12-18 21:08:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's a little unnerving that so much that's written (or drawn) against compulsory distancing ends up being indistinguishable from denying the effectiveness of distancing at suppressing transmission of the virus.

1334147747893669888 2020-12-02 14:49:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @way_turtle Portending is prophecy, I suppose. A research programme can begin with untestable conjectures even if it is focused on creating testable ones.
1333914268111081472 2020-12-01 23:21:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I meant intended to address specific problems *rather then meet some abstract standard of moral rightness* – even a true one: we can't know what it even means if it's too far removed from real problems.
1333883601897869313 2020-12-01 21:20:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Jaffui @DrakerGuy Right. But also, in some cases there can be a legal responsibility to state things clearly and to avoid misleading. Not just on parents but e.g. on employment agencies recruiting foreign staff.
1333877717952028672 2020-12-01 20:56:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif @Abundan82574892 There can never be any guarantees, and yes, we should not ignore threats.  But it's no accident that your example doesn't refer to a polity with political traditions of criticism and consent.
1333842997562191873 2020-12-01 18:38:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DoomunitSCS With hindsight (I didn't think this at the time), this feature alone made it imperative to leave.
1333842544753565706 2020-12-01 18:36:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DoomunitSCS Just as joiining the EU was a gradual process that involved treaty after treaty, over decades, so leaving should have been a matter of withdrawing from them one by one. Trouble is, those treaties themselves made that illegal. The only two options they allowed were all or nothing.
1333836897655939078 2020-12-01 18:14:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Abundan82574892 Whenever we lose an argument in an open society, we have no one else to blame. We must just find better arguments—or better positions.
1333826243645624322 2020-12-01 17:32:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Of course there are injustices throughout existing laws. None are remotely as bad as utopianism. Changes should be as gradual and reversible as possible, intended to address specific problems, and replaced by something argued to be better by a plurality.
1333811779202375680 2020-12-01 16:34:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @morgan_jamz Indeed, people offering options often have strict duties and criteria to follow.
1333811151218544644 2020-12-01 16:32:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jwesamuel E.g. if someone's answer depends on how a question is worded, or by whom (e.g. an advocate of one option or another), they may (*may*) be confused or misled.  But this is common in marketing and opinion polls, so beware of enacting a criterion that would disenfranchise everyone.
1333796699031048196 2020-12-01 15:34:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Identifying which laws do that and what good they may nevertheless do along with the injustices and how to retain that good in a new, just law, takes creativity.  But yes, any law that treats people *as if* they are something that uncontroversially they often aren't, is suspect.
1333790576555163651 2020-12-01 15:10:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @GGPSmith Sorry about that.
1333789656173842432 2020-12-01 15:06:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Knowledge, and competence to decide, come from thought, argument, persuasion, whether one has 'experience' or not. And 'experience' comes via those anyway.
1333789654735151109 2020-12-01 15:06:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> People taking out a pension don't know what it's like to be old. Judges aren't deemed incompetent to judge if they don't know what it's like to think one's a different sex. Etc.
1333789652877074436 2020-12-01 15:06:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The very fact that there's a dispute about this among people who are, shows that that's no reason to override someone's expressed wishes. As I said, there can be reasons, but that's not one of them.
1333782578554306563 2020-12-01 14:38:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DrakerGuy That members of a group the defendant belongs to are *more likely* to have a certain attribute should not be admissible as evidence that the defendant has it, right?
1333770551517736960 2020-12-01 13:50:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So e.g. compulsory homework can't be justified via cultural clues like "never did me any harm" or "Science says". Those considerations can be means of persuasion, not justifications of force.
1333770550502707200 2020-12-01 13:50:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That situation is extremely rare. The list "pressured, misled, confused etc." does not include "mistaken",  "immature" or "ignorant".
1333770549420560387 2020-12-01 13:50:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Rarely, this fact cannot be determined forensically. If an immediate decision is needed, and impossible to undo later, one has to guess, using cultural clues like opinions of people who have had their ostensible decision respected or denied, when they are no longer pressured etc.
1333695512143417346 2020-12-01 08:52:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Its authors are.
1333493676555776003 2020-11-30 19:30:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @GGPSmith It was irony. The behaviour is foul and immoral, regardless of 'outcome'.

1333376678006050820 2020-11-30 11:45:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tobyordoxford @anderssandberg The thing is, such measures of efficiency are barely relevant for judging universal constructors, which will be optimal when they reduce the required human effort to *zero* (no additive constant), other than creative effort, which they cannot reduce at all.
1333365843380629504 2020-11-30 11:02:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @anderssandberg Exactly.
1333329820839792642 2020-11-30 08:39:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tobyordoxford @anderssandberg Yes. But it was a *multiplicative* constant in the algorithmic case. Huge difference in practice!
1333196546775638016 2020-11-29 23:50:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @anderssandberg Yes.  Except that any of them can be programmed to build any other.
1333193860755972096 2020-11-29 23:39:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @anderssandberg Watch this space…  But yes, if the specialised tool is more efficient, the universal constructor can be programmed to make one and then take the afternoon off.
1333187834258272259 2020-11-29 23:15:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> BTW, once there are universal constructors, the relevant measures of efficiency will change drastically. Even the concept of trade-offs will change.
1333100710318247939 2020-11-29 17:29:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ParmenidesvonE @anderssandberg @memarkelliottme @elidourado No more than that tweet was written by your great-grandparents.
1333042549532012546 2020-11-29 13:38:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @david_hurn @ToKTeacher Bad memes.
1333032925751898112 2020-11-29 12:59:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And even some very inefficient projects are quite likely to be implemented for fun if they have previously existed in famous fiction. E.g. floating cities and antimatter drives. 6/6
1333032924501970944 2020-11-29 12:59:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And anyway, "flesh-and-blood people" is a bit of a category error. People are software. They're not made of stuff, they're instantiated in stuff. 5/6
1333032923310731271 2020-11-29 12:59:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If they use a specialised form of travel, they are still flesh-and-blood people even if those come along in bottles. 4/6
1333032922161491969 2020-11-29 12:59:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And it includes flesh-and-blood people enhanced to withstand huge accelerations, just as we use seat belts. 3/6
1333032920890695680 2020-11-29 12:59:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But I think the examples above are poor. "Flesh-and-blood people" includes flesh-and-blood immortal people, who might enjoy a 1000-yr adventure. 2/6
1333032919418466304 2020-11-29 12:59:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I agree that almost everything that could be done, will never be done. For many reasons, including inefficiency—but also morality. 1/6
1332967678877765632 2020-11-29 08:40:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @martynsskye Of course not.
1332788824674627585 2020-11-28 20:49:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ReachChristofer @RealtimeAI It's saying predicted.  It may be unaware that there are two different things, both of which, confusingly, are often called 'explanation'.
1332787646138101762 2020-11-28 20:45:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @snchou0 A universal constructor has to be perfectly obedient and therefore non-creative and therefore cannot create a new explanation.  I hadn't understood this properly when I wrote BoI. Sorry.
1332738633607094273 2020-11-28 17:30:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @imothyjones @ReachChristofer Nothing is caused by its effects.  But some things are caused by the creation of knowledge, which isn't in turn caused by those things.
1332716511786622979 2020-11-28 16:02:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @imothyjones @ReachChristofer Well, requiring causation but only at the level of laws of physics causing electrons to move and hence neurons to fire, thoughts…etc. But e.g. since those laws are time-reversal invariant they would also imply that the effects cause the cause and hence that causes don't exist.
1332708996613087232 2020-11-28 15:32:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ReachChristofer Is that the same as reductionism?  I ask because many arguments purporting to disprove the existence of freewill/consciousness/self/agency etc. would, if valid, disprove the existence of causation altogether.  In which case it's more efficient to address those directly.
1332618691016613895 2020-11-28 09:33:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichB118 Why would sentient robots be better at detecting this than humans?
1332412165970669568 2020-11-27 19:53:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PBPublico Swords have hilts for a reason: like all weapons, they are dangerous. They can injure or kill their users. But they are incapable of 'turning on their users': they have no volition. Nor do any robots or AIs short of AGIs.
1332376655592042497 2020-11-27 17:32:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @_ChristJohnston @paulg Yes I should have said human choices. Behaviour not affected by creativity can be explained scientifically.
1332371575908278274 2020-11-27 17:11:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Another possible headline would have been "Endangered animals NOT threatened by pandemic as ecotourists stay home". https://t.co/KR6l6WsIv9
1332366148155871234 2020-11-27 16:50:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> LOL. But give it another 10 years and it'll be real.
1332354429522161671 2020-11-27 16:03:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @pkhaff @ToKTeacher Unaware of it. But also, I can't recall saying anything about intuitionistic mathematics. Only about intuitionism, a theory in the philosophy of mathematics.  Identifying the two would be an example of the Mathematicians' Misconception.
1332281544824786946 2020-11-27 11:14:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KevinMonk @WineRides No. There's no critical process in a cell that tries to evaluate new ideas. Viruses enter cells by force, not by seeming beneficial.   Models of human thought and communication that omit creativity and criticism lead to dismal false prophecies and authoritarian policies.
1332246905934450689 2020-11-27 08:56:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KevinMonk @WineRides Hence the concept of 'fake news' as something new, menacing, and requiring extraordinary measures against free expression, is itself a widespread (and not new) misconception.
1332246082680655879 2020-11-27 08:53:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KevinMonk @WineRides Widespread misconceptions are common and always have been. That some of them are common because they favour some large faction is natural.  In an open society, they can be criticised and thereby corrected. But there can never be a guarantee or even a probability. It is up to us.
1332085177577836551 2020-11-26 22:13:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TrueNorth_Gal Unfortunately we rarely have that kind of knowledge about anything new, including Covid itself. E.g. there's no *evidence* that Long Covid won't strike a year later in most people, born and unborn.  Using "what if explanationless things happen?" to decide is Russian roulette.
1332081178292129793 2020-11-26 21:57:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @paulg Try this in 1860 and you'll predict 1960 spectacularly wrong because you won't have predicted the "great car culture".  If you're exceptionally prescient in 1900, and guess the Stanley Steamer is the way of the future, you'll still be way wrong about 1960.

1332074370068574210 2020-11-26 21:30:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @paulg The most ancient of all distinctively human behaviours, I guess.  And not in a good way.
1332073184552759296 2020-11-26 21:26:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @paulg Well, there's no such thing as a science of human behaviour and hence not much of a science of how effective various 'lockdown' measures are. But there can be a science of how effective various forms of *distancing* are for a given pathogen.

1326826051012620294 2020-11-12 09:55:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @james_barton Emergencies like wars and pandemics suddenly change the relationships between e.g. real wealth and its usual proxies. It's surely a mistake to call this change a change in wealth.  Would be even worse than calling inflation, or a change in the gold price, a change in wealth.
1326823607755026432 2020-11-12 09:46:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Does it make sense that if there's a war and the government forces people to work manufacturing explosives and weapons 24/7, that's called an economic stimulus, whereas if it makes them stay at home watching Netflix, that's called a recession?

No evidence that banning it would harm anyone…  Without evidence, how should one have argued against Prohibition?

1326094739456872448 2020-11-10 09:29:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Unfortunately, none of that can work unless we first address the problem of why so many people think that the most prestigious scientific institutions are engaging in manipulative political campaigns.

1325750539003506688 2020-11-09 10:42:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Creative thought could create even more ingenious ways of lying to oneself and others. Or it could decide to undo all that.
1325750537954975744 2020-11-09 10:42:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Creative thought is under way in hundreds of millions of American minds. The traditions of criticism, consent and error correction are functioning.

Yet, these miraculous peace &amp; normalisation treaties may create an environment in which it eventually evolves away.  Even in the Foreign Office and the State Department.

Many people think they know of an option that most voters would prefer to those *currently on offer*. When they run for office, they are testing whether that is so.

1324136374354759681 2020-11-04 23:48:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Is there a hyperbole competition under way that I somehow haven't heard of?  https://t.co/ZW4SeKUqRd
1323976182480752642 2020-11-04 13:11:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> What is it that has seized them? I don't know. But it's a memeplex that induces a culture of hyperbole, and more broadly a culture of frantic, pious lying.
1323970829709959169 2020-11-04 12:50:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In a proportion of cases, shame and embarrassment are also conditioned by the prevailing culture. One wouldn't expect people to answer truthfully to cold calls about their adultery or sexual preferences either.
1323969778961309698 2020-11-04 12:46:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DorfGinger Among other reasons: in a proportion of cases, friends and family are listening.
1323931959517728768 2020-11-04 10:15:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidAGreen87 @EVKontorovich It only explains it on the assumption that people who "have better things to do" are largely right-wingers. But in that case, it doesn't address why that wasn't so in the recent past, when opinion polls were much more accurate.
1323898743150751749 2020-11-04 08:03:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidAGreen87 That doesn't explain what @EVKontorovich   was asking about, namely that the phenomenon seems to be heavily one-sided.
1323895583137013761 2020-11-04 07:51:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Not terrified. Prudent.  It says that the other side has seized the commanding heights of the economy of ideas.

1322854106889900032 2020-11-01 10:52:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RobWilcocks I can't possibly know specifically. But  https://t.co/ufNg20zD0U
1322848613161193474 2020-11-01 10:31:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This can be said of all medical interventions: they don't "stop deaths", they "merely delay them" at great economic cost.
1322633708193677313 2020-10-31 20:17:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis The statement "Das Gras ist grün" is true if and only if the grass is green. Nothing *makes* the statement true or false. It just is. And the correspondence isn't an additional, mysterious entity linking the statement with the grass, but just a shorthand for the above.
1322626644323028993 2020-10-31 19:48:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Does he favour a different theory of truth, or does he think the concept is a mistake?  Also, "…between the thing that is true, and the thing that makes it so" sounds wrong to me as a characterisation of the correspondence theory.
1322610262063591425 2020-10-31 18:43:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> E.g. when you run a computer model, most of the explanation doesn't make it though the compiler. It gets left behind in the comments and the variable names in the source code.
1322610260771819520 2020-10-31 18:43:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I don't think I disagree with anything you write there but I'd be more in tune with it if it also stressed both creativity and fallibility. Also I don't think 'model' captures what I mean by 'explanation'.
1322610259299545094 2020-10-31 18:43:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> There are many arguments against empiricism. I think the central ones are that sensory data are sought, not received passively; and are meaningless until interpreted; and that human knowledge consists of explanations, not summaries of data nor predictions of future data.
1322596038012735489 2020-10-31 17:47:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Shaktidass18 @DouglasCarswell It's a mistake to think of knowledge as a fluid that must either come from existing knowledge or from an authoritative source, such as 'the senses' or holy books.  That's not what happens, or could happen.  Actually all knowledge consists of guesses and originates in creativity.
1322582663912370181 2020-10-31 16:54:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @afzoltan That's not a very extreme coincidence. Not as extreme, for instance, as if there were no well-known coincidences.
1322538245134176256 2020-10-31 13:57:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @omorley @DouglasCarswell Against what? The charge that they're doing too little too late? Or rushing in with foolish measures? Deferring blindly to experts? Or ignoring expert advice? Panicking? Or carrying out an evil long term plan to abolish liberties?  You're right—none of those seem plausble to me.
1322534791615492098 2020-10-31 13:44:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @james_burnett_ @DouglasCarswell When one is convinced one knows the best policy, because it is clear, then there is a temptation to try to explain why it isn't being followed. And that way lies … everything bad.
1322493821289222144 2020-10-31 11:01:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell That *it's not known* what the right policy is in this pandemic, and that many different, incompatible policies are all reasonable under the circumstances, is a fact, but for many reasons can be a difficult and bitter one to take on board.
1322490339396038656 2020-10-31 10:47:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell I think economists chronically get predictions wrong when they try to prophesy things that depend strongly on knowledge creation. Epidemiologists sometimes do that too in regard to human behaviour, but in the present case, not enough is known about the virus either.
1322489995698032641 2020-10-31 10:46:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell You use the term 'empiricism' differently from me. I use it to refer to a *false* philosophical theory, that "all knowledge is derived from the senses". Inductivism is another false philosophical theory.
1322302253366214657 2020-10-30 22:19:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @carolynporco @westwing1 That history doesn't sound accurate to me. Can you suggest a source?

1322121341445804032 2020-10-30 10:21:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Perhaps The Queen's Gambit will do for chess what Amadeus did for Mozart.
1322119012910813185 2020-10-30 10:11:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Whether it will continue will depend, as always, on people's choices. There's never anything inevitable about those.
1322119011761594368 2020-10-30 10:11:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And during many earlier eras. Yet rapid progress continued during all those. Despite some things deteriorating, progress is continuing now.
1321959603534499846 2020-10-29 23:38:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @GilM Some will do that. Others won't. It is not the case that few Americans ever learn anything.
1321949465704583169 2020-10-29 22:58:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Marco_Piani Then, again, many people would be proved wrong, including me, and might learn something. Mr Trump certainly would, at his leisure in Federal prison.
1321945858032762883 2020-10-29 22:43:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Hmm. It occurs to me that if Trump loses and leaves office peacefully in January, a significant number of voters will have been proved wrong and might learn something. But if Trump wins and cities are burned down, no one will learn anything.

1321892874867396609 2020-10-29 19:13:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif About as formal as one can get with statements in natural language. But it doesn't differ in this case from commonsense reasoning. (Like 'something is allowed if it's not forbidden', etc.)
1321891913151270914 2020-10-29 19:09:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Kaiwingchun Things like: streamline error correcting processes; tentatively install new ones; take precautions against a number of eventualities even if they cannot possibly all happen; increase diversity of policies tried; accelerate knowledge creation both specific and fundamental.
1321865735921147906 2020-10-29 17:25:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @petegrif It's just logic.
1321846959041323009 2020-10-29 16:10:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The full costs and benefits are not predictable because they depend on attributes of the virus that are not yet known.  And on future responses of the public to the restrictions, which are not just unknown but unknowable.  And on future scientific progress—likewise unknowable.
1321842918706040833 2020-10-29 15:54:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf>  https://t.co/bNvitlbDdY p27: "Where we refer to legitimate criticism of Israel […] we mean criticism that is not antisemitic."  So in particular, politicians participating in a Pattern of unhinged, incendiary libels about Israel is legitimate, so long as they don't mention Jews.
1321793651677167616 2020-10-29 12:38:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NathanpmYoung @reversechapter @RowanWright6 Thanks. Also, to make the outcome meaningful, find evidence that increasing the turnout is a good thing. And also that when fewer people do a thing X, that means someone is "stopping" them from doing it.
1321747598697500675 2020-10-29 09:35:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NathanpmYoung @reversechapter @RowanWright6 Because assuming otherwise entails imagining a victim of this  https://t.co/i05HJqwwD3 saying "yes he does all that but he doesn't care whether my vote cancels out his".
1321601702924062722 2020-10-28 23:56:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In a way, yes. But when I look at the first picture, I don't think of the people sitting there; I think of what they are participating in. A system laden with the most valuable knowledge in the world, on which all future progress depends.
1321490076971487233 2020-10-28 16:32:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NathanpmYoung How did those investigations determine that domestic abusers do not look at their victims' votes? And how did they explain why?
1321487582224592897 2020-10-28 16:22:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NathanpmYoung Certainly if you're worried about turnout it's much more effective to provide many more polling stations (Covid secure nowadays) than to give a huge tranche of extra votes to domestic abusers, cult leaders, gangsters and the like.
1321467922024464385 2020-10-28 15:04:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Absolutely, but that's only a minor reason. A more important one is that voting is just the tip of the iceberg of an electoral process. The effective part is the campaign. The persuasion.  That's what gives it legitimacy: 'We lost because we didn't persuade people we were right'.
1321432214928838656 2020-10-28 12:42:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Translation: "It is fitting that all politicians, and in fact all […] on the right and left, should attend to the distinction made between the branches of government by the new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney-Barrett in Congress."
1321428357490368513 2020-10-28 12:27:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Not paradoxes. Lack of knowledge. There are drastically conflicting explanatory theories and the truth is not yet known.  "May" and "in some cases" illustrates this.

1321129204189175811 2020-10-27 16:38:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The horrible fact is that many scientists and philosophers and computer people would agree that that is so and is what science must be.  Bad epistemology causes not just error but tyranny.
1320851815655739393 2020-10-26 22:16:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @rstinghe Postal and proxy voting more than doubles the turnout?

1319712054119378944 2020-10-23 18:47:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @n_iccolo There is no amoral. All human decisions about what to do involve moral ideas, some containing more truth than others. The same holds for institutions ('systems').
1319708666392727552 2020-10-23 18:33:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DorfGinger Yes. Or even choose between existing ones by creating new criteria.

1319672442634293249 2020-10-23 16:10:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It either defines away moral theories as causes of people's choices, or defines 'incentives' as whatever a person responds to, including moral theories.  So, either false or circular.
1319612179163865088 2020-10-23 12:10:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Or alternatively, all concerned might be calmly and rationally adopting the explanations that they find most compelling.  A bit like Brexit.

1319308678495952896 2020-10-22 16:04:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @optimablog It could turn out, yes. But that's because it could also be that the policies actually adopted have exactly minimised the total harm (on some reasonable measure), or maximised it, or anything between.  The harm done by a pandemic, given optimal government response, could be vast.
1319254621580386304 2020-10-22 12:29:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Is the world really divided between those who respond to this with "True because Biden bad" and those who respond with "False because Fox reports it"? Or is it just Twitter?
1319250077819568128 2020-10-22 12:11:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Maybe. But it's not the case that harm done by the pandemic = deaths and disabilities caused by infections + harm done by government actions.  E.g. even in an ideal anarchist society, a pandemic could cause an economic downturn or collapse, and many deaths not from the virus.

1314854987038588928 2020-10-10 09:07:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> For example, suppose there were a (different) plague with strong geographical variation. That's an explicandum, and finding the explanation may be vital.  I could conjecture that the differences are due to cats. Or to adultery. Without having a single statistic on either.
1314854985616809984 2020-10-10 09:07:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> From anywhere.  Existing theories about something unrelated; rickety analogies; dreams; prejudices; misconceptions; hopes; fears; stubbing one's toe. In short, from boundless creative imagination.
1314848264668274689 2020-10-10 08:40:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Just as hard as it is to internalise that evidence cannot imply, justify, or suggest, theories.

Belief theory says there must be, and because belief theory is part of our culture, it is all too easy to think that is self-evident.
1314163861537390592 2020-10-08 11:20:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. And persuasive arguments are new knowledge and therefore deeply unpredictable.  To analyse all thought in terms of the methodology of scientific experiments is to miss most of what's happening.
1314147070916395009 2020-10-08 10:14:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BeliefChallenge I think belief is a misleading category for thinking about thinking.  Ideas exist. Some of them can be usefully classified as conjectures, dogmas, opinions… but classifying them as beliefs and non-beliefs, especially with attached strengths, doesn't correspond to anything real.

1296389344874377216 2020-08-20 10:11:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> A gigawatt is a unit of power, not energy. Saying it can be produced by a given mass of coal or uranium is meaningless.

1283690795766353920 2020-07-16 09:11:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ChrisGuk1 @EPoe187 I suggest that day-to-day experience—such as the fact that human lives have changed since palaeolithic times—is inexplicable on that assumption.

1283415213757407234 2020-07-15 14:56:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Trade benefits all parties materially. And when other considerations are deemed to be more important (as in the case of 5G contracts), *reason* still benefits all parties who use it.  The 'special relationship' isn't about trade but about a shared conception of rationality.
1283098738500595712 2020-07-14 17:59:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EricDonald Our ideas are not only subject to error, they are riddled with error. We'll never find a "good" (i.e. error-free) reason.  "Thou shalt not kill" is a notorious mistranslation.
1283061663235801088 2020-07-14 15:31:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes, devastating.
1283003557835354112 2020-07-14 11:40:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MahyarTousi We need to know a brute fact: how much not wearing them endangers others.  No one knows yet. One can't deduce it from political-economic theory.
1282995336760393728 2020-07-14 11:08:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell @buffsoldier_96 It rather damns the Dutch Enlightenment with insufficiently loud praise. It was very unlike the French Revolution.

1282661240100335616 2020-07-13 13:00:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @qcatcworld BTW the actual quote from The Beginning of Infinity is less sweeping: "…a simple test for judging claims […] to have explained the nature of consciousness (or any other computational task): if you can’t program it, you haven’t understood it."
1282020600026996737 2020-07-11 18:35:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Jan_Kranendonk Yes. The Enlightenment had, and has, two branches, the second (e.g. Jacobins and Woke) a reaction against the first.  Both were rebellions against authority and existing institutions. One for the better, one for the worse.

1280902123006447617 2020-07-08 16:30:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @djgish Good, let's do it. But it's dangerous to rely on too few schemes. Dozens of schemes are needed in parallel, to guard against unexpected failures or side-effects.

1280893941060116480 2020-07-08 15:58:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crit_Rat @MatjazLeonardis @ToKTeacher "People can't keep secrets" is not why certain types of conspiracy theoretic explanations of history or current affairs are always false.  It's that when one's secret actions counteract one's publicly claimed objectives, there's no reliable way of turning dupes into conspirators

The key question in these matters is: where's the creativity located? Not in the laws. Not in the atoms. Not in the neurones. Not in the puppets. Only in the people.
1279870092508041224 2020-07-05 20:09:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Equally, somewhere one law of physics is saying to another, "Michael is working us!"  "They work for us" was the most accurate take in that clip.
1279037774713229315 2020-07-03 13:02:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Hibernation is a more accurate term than recession (misallocation of resources that will take time and creativity to correct). No one yet knows how much of a recession the UK is in, or even whether it's in one at all.  Either way: unleash creativity.

But nor are they being devious: they're unaware they're enacting an irrational Pattern, so that what they imagine 'Zionism' to be is the same pack of poisonous falsehoods that others openly apply to Jews in general.
1277198839401848832 2020-06-28 11:15:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey I gave no example because every realistic one is charged with irrational emotion at present. I wanted readers to consider the logic first.

1276956755285639169 2020-06-27 19:13:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I think the perpetrator was a first time offender: he got seriously confused while spraying the bottom-right swastika.

The more there is forced levelling, the more society has to decline into levellers and levelled.  The more people think the world is explained by Lenin's "who, whom?" the more it becomes true.

They should report the state of scientific knowledge, not their policy wish list.

1275445325583409153 2020-06-23 15:07:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm @realzoestrimpel But I expect it's there because he defended the legitimacy of Parliament against that of the King. Even though he trampled it when it became inconvenient to himself.
1275445042283339776 2020-06-23 15:06:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm @realzoestrimpel I doubt that one person in a million who passes that statue knows or cares who put it up or what they said about it. I certainly don't.
1275441542577008641 2020-06-23 14:52:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If this was really taken in Mandatory Palestine in 1927 (and presumably colourised since), it's a piece of history right there.  It would be nice to hear more.
1275429153219784704 2020-06-23 14:03:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm @realzoestrimpel It's not even the case that *those who erected* the statue of Boadicea in London wanted to glorify the mass murder of Roman civilians.
1275428924080734208 2020-06-23 14:02:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm @realzoestrimpel It's simply not the case that any significant faction in Brussels wants to glorify public urination.
1275428773639458816 2020-06-23 14:01:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm @realzoestrimpel No, it's not the case that the "point" of a statue can only be to endorse the moral values of the people depicted. Nor those of the people who erected it.
1275342315578707970 2020-06-23 08:17:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dwarkesh_sp Turing's thesis was about what computational tasks are physically possible. (Mathematicians have a misconception that that isn't so.)  There were many motivations for constructor theory of which that was one.
1275340549113995265 2020-06-23 08:10:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This is not yet known. All this 'suggests' is that we need more knowledge about post-viral syndromes and post-Covid in particular.

1275017516813860877 2020-06-22 10:47:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @emmamrevell @ToKTeacher Not really. Classes whose members have to maintain greater  social distancing from members of other classes than from members of their own are called "bubbles" in that context.
1274851212815450112 2020-06-21 23:46:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. He did good and bad things. Among the bad was nearly destroying the English political tradition— soon afterwards to become the most valuable thing on Earth.  But leave his statue standing.

1274360378038849537 2020-06-20 15:16:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NathanpmYoung @DouglasCarswell But the newcomers would have to write the software to handle their half of the migration processes to and from their platform. Which might be prohibitively expensive for them but trivial for the incumbents.
1274356958515081217 2020-06-20 15:02:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell Wouldn't that favour large incumbents over small newcomers?
1274304940958244865 2020-06-20 11:35:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I didn't know that Jerusalem hosts a monument to the Jordanian soldiers who fell there in the Six-Day War:  https://t.co/1zwUHW5wZz  "It’s basic. It’s human. It’s completely removed from politics and ideology."

1273686010971422721 2020-06-18 18:36:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @keithwoolcock Error correction.
1273594724130095105 2020-06-18 12:33:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @newscientist Only in a rather forced sense of "about to". There's no need to feel guilty: there's plenty of time to save it if we think it best.
1273593218693771271 2020-06-18 12:27:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @theNagual I wasn't referring to feelings. Knowledge is objective, and is necessary for everything good and right, and death objectively destroys it.
1273583621031505920 2020-06-18 11:49:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis For instance, any idea that shortened WW2—e.g. how to crack the Enigma code—did more good in a few months than the virus is doing harm.
1273574121255960579 2020-06-18 11:11:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The world economy is currently laid low by a single molecule—a stupendous amplification factor. Yet that's nothing compared with the good that a single idea can do.  In an optimistic society, it's not true that it's generically easier to destroy than to create.

Evidence on that precise proposition is therefore irrelevant as well as extremely difficult to come by.

1272109198399213568 2020-06-14 10:10:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Draconian punishment for mere vandalism is a terrible idea. It's vandalising a person's life in revenge for their moment of vileness.

1270735419513229313 2020-06-10 15:11:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> By the way,  the impressive monuments and statues of Bürgermeister Lueger in Vienna should also get Plaques of Opprobrium.  And Karl Marx's statue in Highgate Cemetery.

1270732146794168320 2020-06-10 14:58:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So let's keep the statues and add plaques explaining what he did and why people thought it worth commemorating him with statues and why they were wrong.  When future generations change their minds about what he did, they should change the plaques, not the statues.

If so, why is it "wrong [for them] to say" certain things, but OK for you to call their culture "wrong"?

1270012440705740802 2020-06-08 15:18:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatMcGann @Davidandthetwit Can't think of one. Best I can think of are good reasons for *regulating* some of them. E.g. to ensure that labs handling dangerous substances take suitable precautions against leaks, theft, saboteurs, spies, etc.
1269941814959788035 2020-06-08 10:38:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Davidandthetwit For a reason. Involving a good explanation – one that couldn't be applied to everything. Yes.  For instance the argument against revolutions contains very good explanations.
1269939625914707968 2020-06-08 10:29:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Davidandthetwit Criticisms that would apply to absolutely any policy (including the policy of "erring on the side of caution") are bad explanations.
1269934077118951432 2020-06-08 10:07:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @drorspei Indeed that's no contradiction. Lilienthal died innovating gliders. But he died of insufficient innovation—not just by him, but also by the entire human species before him.  Not all precautions consist of throttling innovation. Some are themselves innovations.

We wouldn't want to cede the Isle of Wight even to the US or Australia or other similar jurisdictions. Institutions should only be changed if they're problematic, and then only tentatively.

1268542324986073088 2020-06-04 13:57:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Douglas Murray being eloquent, courageous and justifiably angry  https://t.co/LTbc8BayCW  It needs to be said. But he's too pessimistic: the world is wonderfully better than it was when the rioters used to chant "Ho! Ho! Ho Chi Minh!" and gays were illegal.
1268196558039920642 2020-06-03 15:03:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sapinker That won't be very useful until we know the details of which human behaviours spread the virus by how much.  These behaviours vary greatly across cultures, as does how people change them in response to government advice and policies.

1268097707694047234 2020-06-03 08:30:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm But many in 19th century Western Europe (e.g. the Catholic press in France and Italy, and The Times in Britain) worked hard to legitimise the persecutions  https://t.co/r0trIR11j4 even while others were beginning to refuse to.
1268093324264693761 2020-06-03 08:13:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm That's a complicated issue. In medieval times definitely. But e.g. the Damascus Affair could never have happened in Western Europe.  And the Pattern (a widespread perversion of moral thinking) must be distinguished from the persecution and violence it sometimes causes.
1267773035932717065 2020-06-02 11:00:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell However, both fortunately and unfortunately, 'education' in that sense is largely ineffective. Persuasion is needed.

1267415588869193728 2020-06-01 11:19:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That's because "Kike" and "hook-nosed" are not attributes that legitimise hurting someone while 'thoroughly enjoying beating and shooting children' is.  So the former descriptions are beyond the pale while the latter is legitimised by the mainstream even when recognised as false.
1267415587845738498 2020-06-01 11:19:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> When she publishes a torrent of vile false accusations such as that they "thoroughly enjoy beating and shooting children", the civilised world makes excuses for the ancient blood libel.
1267104223558336521 2020-05-31 14:42:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @leantester Nice idea. As he says, one problem would be compliance/enforcement.  Also there's the pesky problem that we just don't know enough. His model is based on explanatory theories that might not be true.

1265958540163846144 2020-05-28 10:50:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Indeed. I doubt many would add constructor theory to the list for another decade or two. 😉
1265791774775222278 2020-05-27 23:47:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This is very true of physics, maths etc. too. But I suppose that's less puzzling than the fact that it's true of chess.

1263450392848936964 2020-05-21 12:43:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> No, the Government seems to have been taking reasonable decisions, taking into account the limited scientific knowledge available.  With hindsight, they have changed some.  Fault them for CALLING this "following the science". But that's quite rightly not what they've been doing.

1261996134375002112 2020-05-17 12:24:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Quite: who knows?  Since it's currently greater than any one person can yet conceive of, it may be futile to speculate about further details.

He just found it harder to do philosophy in it than in English. Bronowski may be reporting a similar experience.  Nothing to do with perfect or original, or general-purpose "best".
1261975993876611072 2020-05-17 11:04:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AndyKellz84 Thing is, data never suggest. Only explanations do.  Currently the best explanations of death records etc. say that very few young children have died of the virus.  But there seem to be no good explanations of why.

1261721093620011010 2020-05-16 18:12:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DeanPetrulakis No it's that skydivers aren't in sharp energy states.
1261720842477670400 2020-05-16 18:11:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @einselection Very roughly, yes.  But that opens up a large can of worms. For instance, if an electron is present, the state isn't the vacuum.
1261702684018696192 2020-05-16 16:58:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Also, if an electron really were "in" one of those orbital states (which have fixed energy, not fixed distance from the nucleus), it would never drop to a lower one unless pushed. Unlike a skydiver.

1261071792300490758 2020-05-14 23:11:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Rundblad It is due to Page &amp; Wootters (and before that to Wheeler &amp; DeWitt though they didn't make that explicit).

1260880947983142913 2020-05-14 10:33:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mattwridley @DanielJHannan Was there actually significant 'hoarding' or 'panic buying'? Or was it merely supermarkets failing to anticipate a second Christmas and then blaming their customers, thus causing them very justified alarm?

1260612704508751872 2020-05-13 16:47:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell That seems to be the current policy.  And it should remain the policy indefinitely.

1259852794611335175 2020-05-11 14:28:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell The document is nevertheless confusingly written in parts. E.g. "the Government will take into account…the country’s long-term economic future, which could be harmed by people being out of jobs and by insolvencies, and investing in supporting an economic bounce back"  Er—what?
1259850599430074370 2020-05-11 14:19:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell I'm reading them too and I agree.  Boris's presentation was OK in content but wasn't up to his usual standard of optimism.
1259827548353105923 2020-05-11 12:47:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dafacto I guess those police officers were mistaken in what the law now says. This happened in Britain too and was addressed.  If the law *did* require them to do that, it must and will be fixed.  It's also possible that the video was misleading and the incident was about something else.

1258782315330842625 2020-05-08 15:34:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Stonehenge may have begun like this, giving quiet thanks to their gods. And then things gradually became more competitive.

1258765609619402754 2020-05-08 14:28:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bmcpburgh @akvadrako It's supposed to provide an equal *income*. Regardless of people's needs. Or else it is just an ordinary, discriminatory welfare system.  In terms of need, people are very unalike. Children need less food, and athletes more, than the average person.
1258756979826270208 2020-05-08 13:53:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Something went badly wrong with several constitutionally significant institutions, and remained uncorrected for years. After (not during) the emergency, this needs to be investigated and fixed.
1258754963091701760 2020-05-08 13:45:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @akvadrako I doubt it. I guess that measures that assume that people are alike, or try to make them so, generally impede creativity.  Further, I think 'universal' is a mere slogan unless e.g. children, immigrants, visitors, criminals, AGIs … are indiscriminately entitled to equal payouts.

1258462580428935168 2020-05-07 18:23:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> He gave an explanation. Good. But it's not known whether that explanation is true, partly true, or false. It will be known, but it isn't yet.
1258327843378991104 2020-05-07 09:28:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DequinceyDr An experience that happened after a decision can't make the decision irrational.  Ceterum censeo: what happened is not yet known. No one knows.
1258326214206521345 2020-05-07 09:22:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Casting the mission as merely staving off stagnation is pessimistic prophecy. The mission should be to unleash the creativity pent up by the lockdown, allowing a post pandemic boom, and then a transition to a creativity-driven economy and society, better in every way than before.
1257714988069855232 2020-05-05 16:53:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TradesTb No.
1257638832620613632 2020-05-05 11:50:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NathanpmYoung That differences between people are vastly bigger than they seem. Too big and complex to be grasped via existing conceptual models.

Though most specific things aren't interesting, interesting things are overwhelmingly common.  2. People are inconceivably different from one another.  3. Sustained, rapid progress is possible.
1257449777484234758 2020-05-04 23:19:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @the_whyer @DanielJHannan Yeah this is the sort of thing that people who, unlike me, are virologists, epidemiologists and medical researchers, are forming and criticising explanations about 24-7 now. I don't see one in the paper though.
1257343433439612930 2020-05-04 16:16:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan I think—as a layman: There's an explanatory theory that under-10s lack receptors by which the virus enters cells. So they're extremely unlikely to catch or transmit it. No known evidence or viable explanation contradicts this. So it's not necessary to keep primary schools closed.
1257255987280596992 2020-05-04 10:29:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It was a very good introductory talk, by the way. I recommend it even though some of the details, as he warned, have *already* been superseded.  Incidentally, it's a cure for the trope that Government policy on the pandemic has been whimsical or unsophisticated.
1257252813622697984 2020-05-04 10:16:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan Of course minor restrictions that had no explanatory basis should go. And yes, it's time to lift some of those that did. Vigilantly. Preparing for, and preparing to prevent, the worst.
1257252439595589633 2020-05-04 10:15:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan In some previous epidemics the second wave was the worst.  So after their first wave it *wasn't* clear that the worst was over.  *That's* the "worst" we need to prepare for. And we need to set up tools to anticipate it.
1257070218926600192 2020-05-03 22:11:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "Undoubtedly, many of the things in this talk will be superseded"  Ceterum censeo: All assertions, explanations, proposals etc. about the pandemic should stress this, as Whitty does.

1257033230487871489 2020-05-03 19:44:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tonklaus @RichardDawkins Of course not. Not even bad philosophy does.

Say Schubert has been saved many times and is now 223 years old and still composing masterpieces. Do you contribute to funding the research that would save him again? Or to the campaign to ban such research?
1256922029820973057 2020-05-03 12:22:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Spoiler: all four of them fully recovered. But...  https://t.co/jcU0VzVTJM

I guess extending emergency deregulations that are currently in force would be on the very long list that those with that knowledge would consider.

1256862382711812098 2020-05-03 08:25:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes The civilised world would never *do* this. But nor would they ever deny its legitimacy.  Hence they support it in essential ways but with absurd ad hoc excuses and with eyes tight shut.
1256727401767284738 2020-05-02 23:28:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @andrew_lilico @NorbertElekes So is  85% either essential or being done from home?

1256710612832473088 2020-05-02 22:22:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NorbertElekes Does this mean that 95.3% of a modern economy is either essential or can be done from home? If not, what does it mean?
1256627417973690369 2020-05-02 16:51:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Telegraph @moutet That the British are nostalgic for their former Empire is one of the most extreme misconceptions people currently have about other people anywhere.  It is not an exaggeration of a minor trend. It is not an insight into hidden psychology. It has nothing valuable. It is just false.
1256613453638311937 2020-05-02 15:56:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Same!
1256566652348465154 2020-05-02 12:50:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. But don't be sorry.  The fact that there are things that we need to know but are just not known (yet) is a major factor in the world's current problem situation, and it can't be resolved by statistics, fudging, Bayesianism, or scientism.

Yet they never fight and rarely get extremely aggrieved with each other's behaviour.
1256147170010562560 2020-05-01 09:03:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> OK I clap as hard as the next guy, but this new religion is starting to get a little creepy now.
1255975762626256898 2020-04-30 21:42:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @andrew_lilico @DanielJHannan That too, I guess.
1255971444749721600 2020-04-30 21:25:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan I guess the effect of a mistaken relaxation is only *detectable* at least two weeks later, by which time the actual effect will have grown exponentially and require a lengthy period of reimposition. So the total time required will be much longer.  Also many people will have died.

Human behaviour depends partly on knowledge creation and this is a limitation on predicting it, even with the best available explanations. This applies to a large extent (but not totally) in economics, and somewhat less to epidemiology.
1255787541132914690 2020-04-30 09:14:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Adam__Connolly @andrew_lilico We shouldn't. A model shows what the explanations it is based on imply. It does not address whether they are true.  All that means is that if you claim the predictions are false, you are contradicting one of those explanations (or saying that the model doesn't express them).
1255628070188462080 2020-04-29 22:40:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DrJoFrederick Winston Willem Johnson.
1255472467377893378 2020-04-29 12:22:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidPittelli1 Yes exponential growth happens iff R0&gt;1. I must have expressed their conclusion badly.

1255436824455118851 2020-04-29 10:00:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Because of fat-tail distributions, infections can spread exponentially when the average number of new cases per person is below 1. This paper, not yet peer-reviewed, models that and draws policy conclusions for how to emerge from lockdowns, and how not to:  https://t.co/sw3XT1ALU8

1255411284239175682 2020-04-29 08:19:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Is it known whether the several extinct species that could create new explanations, had a common ancestor that also could?
1255278366325948416 2020-04-28 23:30:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That's my main takeaway from the article.

In a political democracy the *losers* of votes consider duly enacted laws *legitimate*. This is best achieved by long tradition and far from an automatic consequence of voting. Families have the means to be creative to recreate that.
1255072237184581633 2020-04-28 09:51:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Maybe the answer is: it really didn’t stay at R=1 for long, and the CMO was mistaken when he gave an explanation for why it would.  https://t.co/8b5dW2shoD

1254793360491061248 2020-04-27 15:23:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Nothing's ever proved in science or human affairs. It's explanations all the way down.  'Whether lockdowns work' is especially opaque. But uncontroversial explanations imply that behaviour affects the course of epidemics and that government policies affect behaviour in many ways.

1254398658168131586 2020-04-26 13:15:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher There is a genuine problem here, which that system, however, doesn't solve.  Imagine there are lots of people in a crowd all 3m or even 4m apart. You're one of them and your train is announced. How do you get to it while maintaining 2m separation?
1254333293912358912 2020-04-26 08:55:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> At one time, connecting every home to a sewage system seemed much more impossibly futuristic:  https://t.co/uSOCCiUOeP

1254131045361991680 2020-04-25 19:31:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell @GeorgeTrefgarne Online?
1254130649243451393 2020-04-25 19:30:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell It's different from a recession because when a misallocation of resources is corrected, some firms fold and some people have to find new jobs. That didn't use to happen in Septembers and Rishi is trying to stop it happening after the lockdown.
1254129983007711239 2020-04-25 19:27:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell Exactly. And when most of France or Italy used to shut down for August, some people bemoaned the loss of production but not one thought to call it a "recession".
1254059316740530176 2020-04-25 14:46:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I must admit I don't understand the CMO's explanation of why an artificial peak lasts longer than a natural peak.  Presumably both kinds of peak occur near R=1, albeit for different reasons. Why isn't that an unstable point? How can it persist?
1254007786251395072 2020-04-25 11:22:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> What if Cummings had wasted precious days by merely awaiting the SAGE reports, rather than attending its meetings to learn and ask questions and get explanations in order to inform government policy in real time?  I guess he'd have been accused of callous negligence by the press.

1253725507235037184 2020-04-24 16:40:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EyalShay2 None of those are useful either.
1253720216183476224 2020-04-24 16:19:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EyalShay2 Israel is an advanced society with strong Enlightenment institutions. It has no inherent tendency to "become worse". The opposite it the case.  Barrages of absurd lies do not constitute "watching" or criticism  in any useful sense. They just poison genuine critical dialogue.
1253710582605283328 2020-04-24 15:41:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. But they also never died during the millennia before Wikipedia, Google or Palestinians ever existed.  Most people, including very decent people, have always wanted – deeply needed – to propagate them, or at least not to contradict them.
1253695747289219072 2020-04-24 14:42:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich Is it uncontroversial that size makes no difference to the effectiveness of a quarantine/lockdown policy?
1253695180605206528 2020-04-24 14:39:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich But the current 'lockdown' policy has never been tried before, has it? In which case the 'relic of the past' that the textbook refers to must be a different policy.

1253363668806504449 2020-04-23 16:42:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell It may well be strongly affected by multiple factors. The graphs are consistent with that. Uncontroversial theory implies that behaviour must be one of them, and that is in turn affected by policy.  Ceterum censeo: No one knows. Yet.
1253294496789520384 2020-04-23 12:07:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Imagine if only one idea, decided in advance by law and international convention, were permitted.  Now imagine global warming.
1253292030178066436 2020-04-23 11:57:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Saw a report yesterday that there are 140 vaccine projects under way worldwide, each with a different idea.  Of course, the Oxford one is going to win 😉. But the best of luck to all of them!
1253260638366900224 2020-04-23 09:53:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Amazingly thorough mathematically (much more than necessary—maybe that's how they did things in that culture) as well as insightful physically.

1253021855608385540 2020-04-22 18:04:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But for the British people, the sight of our Armed Forces working side-by-side with our brilliant NHS staff offers a calm reassurance that the task is in hand." 2/2

1252849364440977408 2020-04-22 06:38:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen So when one says "the problem was…" that is not the same as saying "they thought the problem was…".  Both are important, in different contexts.
1252848254993104896 2020-04-22 06:34:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen But "physicists' history" is often more useful than actual history, because people at the time had misconceptions about what their own problem was.
1252847370980622338 2020-04-22 06:31:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen FWIW what I was told, in undergraduate lectures, was that the 'catastrophe' was that the classical formula made equilibrium impossible.

1252717597776318465 2020-04-21 21:55:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @Crit_Rat @anderssandberg Think of a time-reversed collapsing black hole (a 'white hole'). It obeys Einstein's equations just like a black hole. But it *starts* with a singularity, then very dense matter, which then explodes out of it and doesn't form a black hole. Likewise the Big Bang.

1252383865911402498 2020-04-20 23:49:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @pigmaher @SamHarrisOrg That's claimed by opponents to be a failed policy and/or leader. All states have those sometimes.
1252379329679355906 2020-04-20 23:31:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @pigmaher @SamHarrisOrg By Jan 21, 2025:  Mr Trump will not be in office.  No US military force, police force or court will have stopped carrying out out lawful orders.  No New York Times journalist will report going into hiding for fear of government death squads.  Immigration will exceed emigration.
1252365999325626369 2020-04-20 22:38:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SamHarrisOrg tl;dr but the headline is false. Though calling the government illegitimate because one thinks it has bad policies is common in failed states, and though competitive hyperbole is too, the US's institutions for rejecting such fashions after trying them out are in no way failing.
1252246954551148544 2020-04-20 14:45:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @prof_wiley @ReachChristofer One doesn't and can't. There are no touchstones of knowledge.  By the way, entropy can't be measured either, but that's an unrelated fact.
1252225973661171712 2020-04-20 13:21:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nubero @SamHarrisOrg I do. But the main difficulty is translating parochialism. There is no corresponding German noun derived from provinzell.
1252171646846283776 2020-04-20 09:45:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ReachChristofer There's no standard measure for knowledge. But I imagine the knowledge on, say, the internet to be much more that that in the human genome.  And if it isn't today, it will be in a week's time. Human knowledge grows exponentially. The genome barely changes on human timescales.
1252153402173222912 2020-04-20 08:33:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nubero @SamHarrisOrg Maybe provinzlerisch would be even better. Trouble is, to translate BoI you'd need a word for parochialism as well. Provinzlerismus? Nah.

1251949737516978177 2020-04-19 19:04:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> There's no good justification, in terms of the objective of the emergency powers, for the decision to ban all IVF treatment.  https://t.co/wBDeCBLbid

1251863360624353280 2020-04-19 13:20:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Azaeres @BSeradjeh The fact that the police use undercover agents and the security services use spies, and what they use them for, is known to the public.  There's no moment of initiation, when the recruits learn that their real mission includes defeating the cause they signed up to defend.
1251859278698291200 2020-04-19 13:04:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mkibbe @DanielJHannan We didn't. The control the government is exerting over people's lives now is minuscule compared with that in, e.g. WW2.  And rightly so, because there was far more at stake then.  The danger is that it won't be relinquished. But that will be determined by argument, not Moloch.
1251857186113945601 2020-04-19 12:56:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JakeTheHuman28 I guess that most scientists concerned are doing the right thing: trying to formulate good explanatory theories and to test them with good experiments.  Unfortunately, "what else could we have done?" is not an argument that can convert a bad explanation into a reliable one.

Required no secrecy after the event, and hence no ongoing conspiracy. And required no dupes.
1249688354771423232 2020-04-13 13:18:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BSeradjeh I'd be reluctant to use the term 'conspiracy theory' if it didn't have all those elements.  If it didn't, it would be a borderline case and classifying it might not be useful.
1249687863278608384 2020-04-13 13:16:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BSeradjeh Doubted that X was true, where X being false would imply the existence of a conspiracy of that type.
1249678921450295296 2020-04-13 12:40:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BSeradjeh A conspiracy theory explains notable events by secret coordinated actions promoting goals that morally conflict with the conspirators' stated ones.  Such a conspiracy could not gain adherents. Also, any coordination with dupes would risk exposure.  No such theory is true, ever.
1249650456823029760 2020-04-13 10:47:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. But it's not a matter of "how can someone?". Comspiratory-theoretic thought has entered the mainstream.

1249271160174522370 2020-04-12 09:40:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @documentavi @RishiSunak Yes but emergency measures should expire. If we keep some of them afterwards it should be via the usual processes of persuasion and criticism.  Libertarians shouldn't use the emergency to sneak in liberalisation, just as paternalists shouldn't use it to sneak in more regulation.
1249267698271432705 2020-04-12 09:26:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Given the emergency, libertarians ought to accept the mass lockdown and police powers. Equally, paternalists ought to accept a temporary mass deregulation.

1248128183305732100 2020-04-09 05:58:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PopperPlay @DoqxaScott @MatjazLeonardis @ToKTeacher Theories and principles *are* explanations. Sometimes one follows from another, but the deepest ones are guesses that do not follow from anything yet known.  The Turing principle is one such. I guess it  follows from a constructor-theoretic principle that's not yet known.
1247935850660364291 2020-04-08 17:14:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JonathanBauerm1 @RhysChellew Much too big a subject. But perhaps explicanda other than hostile press commentary may help. Such as the debate between him and Prof. Mary Beard.
1247934649768312833 2020-04-08 17:09:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. (But it's precedented.)
1247903439683645445 2020-04-08 15:05:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jimi1999uk At the time of the Obama-McCain Presidential contest I was at a dinner in Oxford. People were marvelling at how there could possibly be *any* Republicans. A prominent academic remarked "Yes, I've travelled a lot in the US and I'm not aware of ever having met one." I said nothing.

1247830181676568576 2020-04-08 10:14:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @rob_knight The word "optimism" has a variety of different uses, some overlapping, some flat-out opposing others.  I discuss these in Chapter 9 of my book The Beginning of Infinity.  The original use (by Leibnitz) is more like what most people today would call absolute, fatalistic pessimism.
1247822029589483520 2020-04-08 09:42:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RhysChellew "'With the right knowledge, we can solve this'" optimism is not easy to fake, though it could be done. He appears to have it and I guess he does. It follows from my best explanation of him.

1247494997169012737 2020-04-07 12:02:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Boris is the most prominent optimist in public life.  During and after the pandemic, we shall need unrelenting optimism.  I'm going to #ClapForBoris at 8pm tonight.
1247072803561627648 2020-04-06 08:05:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @evasyl Expense, too, is a matter of lack of knowledge. Everything, except the creation of knowledge itself, becomes ever cheaper as knowledge is created.
1246817953624047617 2020-04-05 15:12:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mike__cunning No. This is explained in my book *The Beginning of Infinity*.
1246752267035910144 2020-04-05 10:51:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And don't mock or blame those who fail or make honest mistakes. Just criticise. Bearing in mind that you, too, may be mistaken.
1246752265693728769 2020-04-05 10:51:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> *Many* others will be sadly saying "We fell short." Or "We failed." Or "We made terrible mistakes." But they should not be sad. Mistakes and failures are integral to any research effort. Prophecy is impossible.
1246752263814746112 2020-04-05 10:51:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Therefore I suggest, when you hear "X is impossible" treat it with even more scepticism than usual. Nothing that is allowed by the laws of physics is beyond the scope of human creativity.
1246752262866833410 2020-04-05 10:51:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Others will be proudly saying "X turned out to be a pipe dream, but we unexpectedly achieved Y!"

(Journalists' questions may have risen slightly above 'gotcha' level too, but I can't really tell because the BBC decided halfway through that we don't need to see them.)
1245720161514127360 2020-04-02 14:30:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. Let's try not to return *entirely* to "normal times' when this is over.  Let's try to retain the gumption and can-do attitude that has surfaced after decades of pessimism and cynicism.

1245714015336239106 2020-04-02 14:05:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @_alanmartin_ @yaacovlozowick Quite so. I entirely agreed with him, but I'd rather not get my way than impose it on people who disagree with it.  (He did have *some* effect, though.)
1245697900656701442 2020-04-02 13:01:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick 'There is a low but unknown probability of a highly damaging event' is not much of a prediction.  There is such a probability of a Krakatoa-like eruption causing a 'year without summer' or worse, and global famine. What resources should now go to mitigating that is not obvious.
1245392630458040320 2020-04-01 16:48:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In the first few of these daily briefings it seemed to me that the statements and the answers to questions (even to silly gotcha questions) were exemplary.

1241847571305422855 2020-03-22 22:01:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> 1. It's just not true that temporary government measures are never repealed when the original justification has passed.  2. Some of the present temporary government measures are liberalisations. May they remain permanently.
1241819357388451840 2020-03-22 20:09:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FraserNelson @DouglasCarswell Of course. And hence both problems will fade away in the coming days. But is it legitimate to worry that they won't fade away fast enough?

1241697922259079170 2020-03-22 12:07:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes It's because that would entail delegitimising their core policy, which has caused that misery.

1241669279944265728 2020-03-22 10:13:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> My wanting to re-popularise the subjunctive may have backfired, causing the last sentence to be misinterpreted. 'Be' is not imperative there. The sentence means: '[It's doing them a disservice] regardless of how useful the supposed experts say their favoured curriculum is'.
1241424596798185472 2020-03-21 18:01:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey Gentle irony.
1241417337028390913 2020-03-21 17:32:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. So a system that seeks to stamp millions of keys with some standardised shape is … doing them a disservice.  Be the shape ever so endorsed by the best experts in key-usefulness.

Which seems reasonable behaviour, and refutes the nasty accusations against the public.

1240997411683786754 2020-03-20 13:43:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PopperPlay No one knows. But false theories about *what* has been happening make it difficult or impossible to discover *why*.
1240979206303100930 2020-03-20 12:31:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MadaghMattis The Pattern (the moral imperative to legitimise hurting Jews) started centuries BCE. I doubt that that imperative changes much over decades. Its *manifestations* (persecution etc) 'spike' whenever that legitimacy is threatened e.g. at the Enlightenment &amp; the foundation of Israel.
1240948834714468352 2020-03-20 10:30:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tomhyde_ Daring to deny conventional wisdom is part not only of rational but also of irrational and anti-rational thought e.g. conspiracy theories.  It presents daring as a source of truth. Rather than institutions of criticism, good explanation, tolerance &amp;c as means of error correction.

1240920209965420544 2020-03-20 08:36:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's stultifying, often catastrophically, for the nation concerned. Yet, always, individuals can choose to be free of it.

1240909588528054272 2020-03-20 07:54:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @thethinkersmith Partly. Also e.g. misinterpreting what is happening when we, for instance, take someone's advice, or choose a reputable plumber.

1240624455082217474 2020-03-19 13:01:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The explanatory theory implied by 'despite' there is an example of the error of interpreting actions in terms of supposed feelings of the actors rather than their stated opinions.  It's a common error but more so among some subcultures than others. Some are almost defined by it.

1240364086443028480 2020-03-18 19:46:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The children continuing to go to school in the UK now are doing their bit in this fight. Like the Land Girls in WW2: conscripted to free up others to go to the front line, they can be proud of doing this work of national importance instead of the usual busywork.
1240261214955061248 2020-03-18 12:58:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Was a fun chat.
1240193391637512192 2020-03-18 08:28:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Where it isn't, let's get serious about finding out why and fixing *that*. (No, the answer isn't that the fruit is hanging too high nowadays. We have ladders.)
1240193390249160705 2020-03-18 08:28:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> An enormous amount of creativity is now presumably being directed at various aspect of this problem. If (as I expect) it is successful at achieving some things that were deemed impossible, let's try to retain the problems-are-soluble attitude when it's over.

1239955925521379328 2020-03-17 16:45:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason In this emergency we have to face ignorance about life-and-death questions like that one. I'm quite impressed that the British CSA and CMO are daring, at least sometimes, to say "we don't know", rather than purporting to derive knowledge, or probabilities, from ignorance.
1239896368510091266 2020-03-17 12:48:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ronancathinjew For millennia people sought systems of thinking whose outcomes had a reason for being true, probably true, nearly true &amp;c.  There's no such system—no such reason. All we can do is try to explain the world by guessing, criticising, and trying to improve upon what seem like errors.
1239677975685185537 2020-03-16 22:20:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason And VR.
1239612171157299200 2020-03-16 17:59:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Usual suspects: Please don't report this as "UK Government places Leader of the Opposition under 'voluntary' house arrest".
1239551445956993024 2020-03-16 13:57:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Somebody please invent a catchy mnemonic for all these stages!
1239321395550617605 2020-03-15 22:43:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @j6sp5r Interesting and complex question. Can't think of a simple criterion. But sometimes, yes, one should do something.
1239317471452106756 2020-03-15 22:28:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @j6sp5r And since you did nothing unreasonable you shouldn't feel bad.
1239315695680315393 2020-03-15 22:21:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed.  I hope this also becomes conventional wisdom in the case of flu, colds etc from now on.  (Until it becomes moot when those are all defeated.)

I suppose the multiple-trillion dollar, life-and-death question is whether that half had pre-existing conditions making them vulnerable.
1238938683883085824 2020-03-14 21:22:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @littlebigfis I suspect whether the reasons for delaying isolation for the vulnerable group were good or bad, the time for that delay has now passed.

1238925508122992640 2020-03-14 20:30:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @recursus @LongDreamFarm @MartinKozh If so, it requires immediate draconian distancing.
1238890276493631495 2020-03-14 18:10:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LongDreamFarm @MartinKozh And the number of intensive-care needs among that group.
1238889600023740418 2020-03-14 18:07:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Yes! (May that work out the way we envisage!)
1238889151883337733 2020-03-14 18:06:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LongDreamFarm @MartinKozh Another relevant number, which they could get without any extra testing, is the number of deaths among non-vulnerable people who test positive. Until the last couple of days, that seems to have been zero. What is it now?
1238887125917077504 2020-03-14 17:58:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LongDreamFarm @MartinKozh That's 1000 tests on 67m people. Would allow us to estimate whether the number of asymptomatic people is much more than about 67,000 or not. Make it 100 such sets!
1238884691870134273 2020-03-14 17:48:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @janko_prester @robertwiblin I have neither epidemiological nor virological knowledge. It's just my 2¢ worth about what arguments I consider reasonable.
1238883426549272577 2020-03-14 17:43:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MartinKozh Do the tests currently done even detect it in asymptomatic people? If not (as I guess) then yes, they should do some blood tests as well, on contacts who are asymptomatic.
1238856837522432000 2020-03-14 15:57:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Premysl_The_Man To what possible policy would this catch-all pessimism not apply?
1238852216359968768 2020-03-14 15:39:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @wtgowers @andrejbauer Both. Because both would confer immunity.
1238851198062596097 2020-03-14 15:35:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @wtgowers @andrejbauer Not if the current number of cases is many times the number known cases. Which seems to be the Government's assumption.
1238849153461112833 2020-03-14 15:27:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @janko_prester @Ed_Pointsman "at a certain point it becomes very hard to reverse" — I think the current UK policy is the one of which that is the least true.
1238847722544922624 2020-03-14 15:21:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Marco_Piani The typical incubation time is 5 days and the R0 is, very roughly, 2. Luckily, this isn't like measles.
1238846989330251777 2020-03-14 15:18:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Ed_Pointsman There's a lot we don't know about everything. Including about how many would die of shutting down the economy. One can't derive knowledge from ignorance. One has to go by the best explanatory theories, while trying to gain more knowledge and evidence.
1238843458661605382 2020-03-14 15:04:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If they are mistaken, they will soon find out, and there would still be time to institute draconian distancing and for that to work.
1238842540981395457 2020-03-14 15:00:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf>  https://t.co/0r6dkYHCwf This will be by far the best policy if, as the Government advisors think, the actual number of cases is currently many times the number of known cases. Because then the death rate for non-vulnerable people is far lower than their death rate per known case.
1238805650483838977 2020-03-14 12:34:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BrunoArine @reasonisfun @MarieKondo @sivers Having fun is no more "assenting to inexplicit ideas" than it is 'assenting to explicit ones'.  As for "what if…"—*no* idea is immune from "what if it's false?" The right stance is to strive not to entrench any idea.
1238783444139872256 2020-03-14 11:06:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> May it be so!
1238610055051829248 2020-03-13 23:37:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Illimitabilist They've given it to us. Here we are, discussing it! Choosing what to do in response, given our individual situations.
1238602573025812481 2020-03-13 23:07:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Illimitabilist If I understand correctly (I may not), the answer is crisis fatigue. They're afraid if they send the pensioners into seclusion too early they'll go stir crazy and defiantly come out again just at the wrong moment.  Something like that happened in the Blitz  https://t.co/GmJHxBBUU5
1238514264341700608 2020-03-13 17:16:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @n_equals_42 I'm hoping the 'models' express explanatory theories.
1238511523083046915 2020-03-13 17:05:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I assume (or at least hope) that he actually means good-explanation-based.
1238235846265966592 2020-03-12 22:50:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @juiceterry87 @james_barton I hope that they're relying on something a bit more explanatory than an analogy with carrier bags.
1238144502507941888 2020-03-12 16:47:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @akvadrako People were more overcrowded when there were fewer people.
1238067560417026049 2020-03-12 11:41:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That "overpopulation" was one of the greatest dangers facing humanity was so taken for granted that some of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century—even Popper and Bronowski, I think—were in fear of it. Yet that was utterly false.
1238065697357475842 2020-03-12 11:33:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @desgren For each person in each problem-situation, there's a right thing to do. It can be very different for people in superficially similar situations.  But in this particular case, it's not a matter of protecting themselves v. others, but of protecting both v. other priorities.
1238053973371781121 2020-03-12 10:47:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I guess it makes sense for *governments* to adopt sub-optimal measures because the optimal ones would be wrecked by "crisis fatigue". But individuals can still act optimally if they want to.
1238036882640056320 2020-03-12 09:39:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This time there is a wolf on the loose.  We are not entirely helpless. Each of us can choose to take steps that will make a difference.  Social distancing is now the main one. And hand washing.

1236672774074257408 2020-03-08 15:19:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @veritasium @Crit_Rat Thanks. Perhaps one day we shall reclaim the older meanings of terms like 'probable'.  (E.g. asserted by good arguments. Sometimes used pejoratively, depending on context!)
1236626665704427520 2020-03-08 12:15:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crit_Rat @veritasium But not that of attributing probabilities to theories, apparently.
1236619603540877313 2020-03-08 11:47:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes @BreitbartNews Yes they didn't even try.
1236603030017015808 2020-03-08 10:41:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes @BreitbartNews It's simply false that they are "mathematically illiterate". The clip would be far less disturbing if they were.

1236064205159247873 2020-03-06 23:00:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamjohnsonnAJ That would be for rational memes at best. And even then, only to the extent that the minds are seeking good explanations.

1235852615566503940 2020-03-06 08:59:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @omriceren This is a different error from socialism though. It's an 'echo chamber' effect, where pro-narrative ideas are not subjected to any criticism.
1235553612475949056 2020-03-05 13:11:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher I learned some interesting things from the CMO and CSA at this news conference on Tuesday.  https://t.co/c8reb31FqQ Including why it can be very useful to implement containment measures for an uncontainable virus.

1233752351762239488 2020-02-29 13:54:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Sunsidhe Whether they received a royal pardon is itself up to the government. I can't imagine that this would be an issue IRL. But IF the government did this and retained the confidence of the House of Commons, then he should be pardoned and the next election will settle the matter.
1233749478311702528 2020-02-29 13:42:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Sunsidhe Rulers and their policies must be removable by the people. Only.  I.e. moral (in this case, political) controversies should be settled by elections. Not by judges or other experts.

1231709097986318337 2020-02-23 22:35:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> There's something odd about that type of misconception: a kind of motte-and-bailey equivocation about whether 'true' and 'false' mean what they do in logic.
1231594303484502016 2020-02-23 14:58:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ProfDBernstein Nor that close: unlike in a parliamentary system, there are severe obstacles to holding the Executive accountable.
1231574502502522881 2020-02-23 13:40:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielsDare People can and do change their minds.
1231573943565332482 2020-02-23 13:38:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> There won't. But there'll be a day when they have understood the context and meaning of all these behaviours and will change them.
1231501731411976192 2020-02-23 08:51:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Simon Williams GM on what maths lessons have taught him:  https://t.co/Ti0tVzdRBj How is it that this phenomenon is taken for granted even by someone reminiscing about its wasting years of his life?
1231343299602108416 2020-02-22 22:21:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Telegraph But is the collective noun for civil service mandarins really just 'series'?
1231200732877139969 2020-02-22 12:55:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Also, holding an idea immutable has an unpredictably large effect on apparently unrelated ideas—like glueing down a jigsaw-puzzle piece in the wrong place may spoil a distant area of the picture. How much of the picture is ruined is a matter of luck. From almost none, to all.

1230872677029679107 2020-02-21 15:11:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @gimmingham Yes it may be a reasonable place to *start*.
1230839062275248133 2020-02-21 12:57:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> OK but a "low-skilled" (i.e. not-paper-qualified) worker may turn out to be, say, a great employer. Or indeed, skilled at something. So may their children.  In fact they will, *if that's why they want to come*.

1230137710255497216 2020-02-19 14:30:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @peterrhague @LiamMFox1 I doubt that's so. But in any case, I refer the honourable gentleman to the answer that I gave a few moments ago.
1230133262900658176 2020-02-19 14:13:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LiamMFox1 Yes.
1230131793577287680 2020-02-19 14:07:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LiamMFox1 'Some' and 'would seem' aren't enough to inform laws regulating violence. Until we have good explanations of creativity and qualia we should err on the side of caution.  But not of blind pessimism. We mustn't even slightly harm a person just in case it turns out fruit has rights.
1230108996436201473 2020-02-19 12:36:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes.

1229102465037017089 2020-02-16 17:57:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> BTW the phrase 'learn one's lesson' is rarely used any longer with the meaning 'do what one is supposed to in class', though it is still often used to mean 'become less creative after a distressing experience'.

1228781859267661831 2020-02-15 20:43:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @krlwlzn The devil is in the detail. The causal link between people's circumstances (including their genes and their culture) and their opinions and actions is mediated by creative thought. No explanation omitting that can be anywhere near accurate.
1228742691971878912 2020-02-15 18:07:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> There is no analogue of the Pattern in hatreds or bigotries with any other target.

1228696469814861831 2020-02-15 15:04:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KittJohnson_ @ToKTeacher Sometimes. Any natural language can express any explanation. Sometimes by expressing new concepts, naming them etc. Which is on a continuum with creating a new language.  It's like: whenever you name a data structure or a subroutine, you are defining a new programming language.
1228692663597195264 2020-02-15 14:48:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hanzo848 Depends on the cosmology. Under some cosmological theories, after a heat death, interested people will appear in a few universes eventually.  But we aren't them.
1228658704058396672 2020-02-15 12:33:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Does police training include a section on the existence of civil liberties in Britain? If not, this is a catastrophic deficiency.  Especially as schools and universities seem to teach the opposite nowadays.

1228320886752763904 2020-02-14 14:11:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Would this be solved by software that is continually updated with all satellite orbits and blinks telescopes accordingly?
1228017198305771520 2020-02-13 18:04:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @krlwlzn @lkesteloot It's something emergent. However, calling it the 'person' has the problem that not all of any person is admirable or even noteworthy. Yet analysing it into components will produce the apparent paradox that there's nothing admirable about atoms since they just obey laws of motion.
1227998214269304834 2020-02-13 16:49:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lkesteloot It's OK to admire a person.  It's OK to be interested in history.  Public-domain Popper images are rare and useful for illustrations.  To be an argument from authority, something must first be an argument.

1227702254456786944 2020-02-12 21:13:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Isometries11 Yes. An honour. And continually had to remind myself not to be so surprised that this old Austrian guy knew Popperian philosophy so accurately and expressed it so well.

1227230612437786629 2020-02-11 13:59:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Death advocacy is mainstream. But an interesting mainstream exception is anti-suicide campaigners.  So it seems the mainstream position is: if you want to stay alive, you shouldn't, and if you want to die, you shouldn't.
1226982919023013888 2020-02-10 21:34:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SamS37753554 That speech contains some perceptive observations but also tacit assumptions that would paralyse researchers if they took them seriously.  In reality, one cannot tell in advance what is significant, important, big or small. Only what is interesting and fun.

There's no information flow to us from the future, and no perceivable flow to us from almost anywhere in the past. Yet we know they're there.  Empiricism is not a true account of how we know things.

1226197201833070599 2020-02-08 17:32:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @outputrotation Because the amount of banking fraud or tax fraud that would undermine institutions of consent is very much greater than the amount of systematic voting fraud that would.
1226171147974316032 2020-02-08 15:49:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SDUPRE No but maybe some would call it a Popperian "turn":  https://t.co/4NH4B2LaXZ
1226166811672170502 2020-02-08 15:32:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Ed_Pointsman @NewScientistPod No it would only be interference.
1226165322341851141 2020-02-08 15:26:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SDUPRE The primary thing is: where there are strong traditions of consent, it is not difficult to find counters whom the main contenders don't suspect of cheating.
1226155973389225985 2020-02-08 14:48:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SDUPRE It's deeper, but not a major issue in polities that have good traditions of consent.

1225814314352816129 2020-02-07 16:11:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Interesting. What does this tell us about our alleged genetic propensity to gorge on sweet things whenever available?

1225330458336145411 2020-02-06 08:08:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NiDiosNiMaestro Not sure I'd heard of Thuringia, but a quick search seems to indicate there's more wrong with its politics than merely the voting system.
1225097124523782144 2020-02-05 16:41:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robnormal @jonathan_church Also incidentally: to justifiably call someone a liar, it's not enough there exists an interpretation under which what he said is false. It has to be, at a minimum, that every interpretation under which what he said is true, is unreasonable.
1225094723813236736 2020-02-05 16:31:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robnormal @jonathan_church Indeed that's by far the most common measure of how good an economy is.  Incidentally, I see it's also best-ever by this measure:  https://t.co/TVKnRvLtq1
1225087950742020096 2020-02-05 16:05:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NathanPMYoung At a minimum:"If he meant this, he's wrong, but if he meant that, he's right"— Or "We tried our best to find a measure on which he's right, but failed." Anything less is campaigning.
1225072931564400641 2020-02-05 15:05:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf>  https://t.co/BTSRF1DJ96 This isn't fact-checking, it's narrative-comparing. E.g. setting "economy best" to "GDP growth rate highest" is an interpretation not a fact.
1224994591864172545 2020-02-05 09:54:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @koaleszenz @reasonisfun But I doubt that any real disaster has ever been caused by this difficulty rather than by real difficulties such as that of communication or finding out what is actually best.

1224459533143150599 2020-02-03 22:27:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NPCollapse That progress can be "hard" and could require creativity is virtually unanimously agreed. So that's not the Moloch argument that people get alarmed about.
1224345743802163200 2020-02-03 14:55:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This was a remarkable speech —  https://t.co/DUIizw6CWb  — boldly contradicting the pervasive philosophical pessimism of recent decades.
1224345676978573313 2020-02-03 14:55:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Moloch is the apotheosis of comprehensive pessimism about human action and the possibility of progress.
1224345675598651392 2020-02-03 14:55:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Moloch is the misconception that one can apply game theory to situations that involve creativity, which in reality game theory cannot model or address.   https://t.co/lNHDLRka0E

Theoretical limit of work rate per unit volume? Controlled black hole accretion I guess. Maximised for small spinning black holes. But they wear out, so may not count.

1223744150522208259 2020-02-01 23:05:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen @nattyover And a nuclear fusion reactor will have many millions of times that power per unit volume. So much for its being merely an "artificial sun"!

1223325754303426565 2020-01-31 19:22:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Indeed.  By the way, Britain hasn't had an impeachment in centuries. Just saying.

1222839275517042689 2020-01-30 11:09:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In this case, she could say: I was wrong about the facts and policies, but that wasn't my fault. And I was dead right about the hypocrisy!
1222683786091036672 2020-01-30 00:51:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yet instead of doing what would be fun, and thereby maybe solving stuff, people do what they're told they 'must', or what they think they 'should'.

1222521452286660609 2020-01-29 14:06:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich The deal is being rejected precisely by those who prefer the status quo to de-legitimising hurting Jews for being Jews.

1222200864464670720 2020-01-28 16:52:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @skeptic_thomas No. Meaning can't be formalised. Similar to this: :  https://t.co/fYAptrkW25
1222157813163663361 2020-01-28 14:01:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @skeptic_thomas I guess so. But we have to be very tentative while we don't know how it will work.
1221941750710853632 2020-01-27 23:43:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Just taking the bet means you lose. And it works for finite money too. (Since, by hypothesis, there is enough money around for taxes to solve it.)
1221940149162053632 2020-01-27 23:36:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Anyone with money who's convinced by the proposition will take the bet.
1221938684909490176 2020-01-27 23:30:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Indeed. And there can never be a convincing argument that consent can't solve a given externalities problem when coercion can.  (Proof by contradiction: If there were, you could bet against that proposition and use your infinite winnings to finance solving the problem yourself.)
1221933920633212928 2020-01-27 23:12:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Me too. Point taken. Nevertheless, massive interventions are risky. And increasing taxes increases our vulnerability to the next emergency.   Are we going to meet them *all* by increasing taxes further?
1221927893372194816 2020-01-27 22:48:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen It'll only be solved by a combination of many approaches none of which is even capable of being the full solution.  We should also expect some approaches to fail or be counter-productive. So seeking one single massive intervention is very unwise.  We need many small ones.

1218283459413708800 2020-01-17 21:26:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @micahtredding No, I think Popper's criterion favours simple majority voting in the legislature. Requiring more makes repeals harder, and makes it harder for governments to get their policies enacted and hence reduces their accountability for what then happens.
1217951394822606849 2020-01-16 23:26:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @micahtredding I don't think it makes any difference by Popper's criterion.

1217501712585576448 2020-01-15 17:40:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen I guess if you want it to be a free particle with an approximately sharp position and momentum, it won't matter what basis you used for 'quantisation'. The excitations of the EM field that are convenient for 'quantisation'—perversely called photons too—are spread out over space.
1216520766663077894 2020-01-13 00:42:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Admittedly, at times I struggle to understand the culture of physics.

1216518041284087814 2020-01-13 00:31:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Maybe this is because it *is* a culture. You have to be steeped in it to understand what the sentences mean.
1216516083143905281 2020-01-13 00:23:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen So does the last sentence of 2 (quoted) contradict the last sentence of 10?

Better answer: yes, just as science begins with myths, and philosophy with religion, rational memes can evolve from anti-rational ones. But there can't be guarantees.
1213077108060311552 2020-01-03 12:38:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Saddam did the same, by the way. Both of them were very unlucky: it usually works.
1213071504444993537 2020-01-03 12:15:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. Someone can kill thousands of people unrelated to Jews or Israel, and get away with it for years, simply by reciting tropes from the Pattern. Because people following the Pattern will then strain logic far beyond breaking point to legitimise his continuing to do so.

1211095873184251904 2019-12-29 01:25:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @omriceren True.
1211088067928428545 2019-12-29 00:54:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @omriceren Hypothetically: if the world's least macho society were suddenly revealed to be secretly the most toxically aggressive one, what would suddenly be legitimised?
1210984389439561730 2019-12-28 18:02:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RJsnda No. They were like: "You have yourself, though in an obscure and inexplicit way…been delivering to me a proposition." (J. Bentham 1827)
1210939138687541248 2019-12-28 15:02:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The OED has examples of 'inexplicit' and 'inexplicitly' going back to the 18th century. Admittedly they all seem to be pejorative.
1210722624680017920 2019-12-28 00:42:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @rubrumtrabea In the case of revolutionaries, perhaps all of them?  But these school strikers aren't revolutionaries. They are trying to *conform* to our society's ostensible moral values more faithfully than their elders.  Not the overthrow of established authority but blind obedience to it.
1210685342015197184 2019-12-27 22:14:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Also, what will happen to those of them who go on strike against the school strike and bunk off to learn some physics?
1210595650234208257 2019-12-27 16:17:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> School strikes are now being put on school curricula:  https://t.co/m1GeNUWzn9  I hope they'll be allowed to strike for causes that aren't already on the curriculum, though.

1209771508933025792 2019-12-25 09:42:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @skeptic_thomas Thus, deep-seated dissatisfactions in the population just fester, and never get addressed by any policy that anyone thinks will work. It is the opposite of fun.

1209608016875737094 2019-12-24 22:53:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @fwmm The premise is false. See the chapter on time in The Fabric of Reality.
1209107455411707906 2019-12-23 13:44:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes Not envy, since envy has countless targets and doesn't produce anything like the Pattern there.  No one would accuse Voltaire of envying the Jews if that idea were not needed to support the envy explanation. He envied the English—and didn't invent bizarre accusations about them.
1209080211553345536 2019-12-23 11:56:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes Identifying *what* is happening comes before explaining *why* .  Elaborating the continuity between religious and secular supersessionism is important.
1209078842452787200 2019-12-23 11:50:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes I'd call supersessionism an ancient, illogical yet grimly persistent rationalisation for legitimising hurting Jews.  One of several such in the Pattern—which isn't a special case or consequence of anything more general e.g. envy, scapegoating, racism…
1209063707789189122 2019-12-23 10:50:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Well worth publication. Perceptive analysis. (BTW  I don't think supersessionism, secular or religious, is *caused by envy*, but never mind that.)
1208689635393769473 2019-12-22 10:04:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Now *there* was someone ahead of his time – and ours.

1207983805631471616 2019-12-20 11:19:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Jediphone @ToKTeacher @reasonisfun Yes. I think speech that is part of an action that is criminal or criminally negligent for other reasons, should itself be criminal.  Torts are more complicated.
1207808180211900416 2019-12-19 23:41:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mike__cunning LOL, that warning and the one popular today could both be true, of course. But yes, the clip is amusing.
1207807575594602497 2019-12-19 23:39:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen There's a non-negligible chance that that moratorium will turn out to have been the most environmentally harmful action ever perpetrated by humans.  That, or the campaign against nuclear power.
1207804364733198339 2019-12-19 23:26:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Hadn't heard of it! Have they been given an exemption, or has the moratorium been lifted, or are they defying it?
1207798002045407232 2019-12-19 23:00:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Possible, and highly desirable. Instead, there has effectively been a worldwide ban on such experiments since 2010.   https://t.co/iggS6q7JkK
1207701611704922114 2019-12-19 16:37:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PhilipPullman I'm hereby warning: without geoengineering, it's going to happen.  And I fear the reaction will not be "OK geoengineering better late than never", but rather "*now* can we have our sumptuary laws?".
1207689647704309760 2019-12-19 15:50:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Is geoengineering on the list?
1207288814122745861 2019-12-18 13:17:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bridgebyapool @gregeganSF Yes. But even aside from radioactivity, I guess inventing and making the "suitable surface" would be a challenge just because of chemistry.
1207264316162027520 2019-12-18 11:40:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Speech is s special case. If your shiny new law makes a mistake about what clothes it is right or wrong to wear, it can be corrected via criticism. If it makes a mistake about what criticism it wrong to utter…
1207217727900925952 2019-12-18 08:35:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Superb.

1207011106742505473 2019-12-17 18:54:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @CarnunMP If quantum theory is true and if, additionally, the dimensionality of the state space of the world is bounded, then so is knowledge.  Both premises are implausible, but it's really speculation about the content of future theories.
1206922460375011328 2019-12-17 13:01:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes When the IAF flew F-15s over Auschwitz in 2003, it was arguably the most appropriate act in history, yet the Auschwitz museum called it "entirely inappropriate".
1206918009744441344 2019-12-17 12:44:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes I don't want to shame individuals but for instance, if you google Obama friend of Israel you will find some more perverse claims.
1206911124593098753 2019-12-17 12:16:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Unfortunately, "one of the most stupid" is an exaggeration. But yes, it is very perverse.

No reason why that should be what *we* need now. It might, but we might need the opposite, or anything in between.
1206873028061278208 2019-12-17 09:45:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @paulpagetappend @dela3499 OK, nicely self-referential … and are there any that have specific values of 'position+momentum'?
1206864853933207553 2019-12-17 09:12:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @paulpagetappend Ah OK.
1206862527788920833 2019-12-17 09:03:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @paulpagetappend If those are *sets* of electrons, there'd have to be some electron with a particular location and momentum. But there isn't.  It's quantum all the way down.

(I.e. for the theory that rationality entails having beliefs whose strengths obey the probability calculus and of striving to assign higher probabilities to truer beliefs.)
1206557233875767296 2019-12-16 12:50:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @IlariLehti @RandyVegetables @Crit_Rat In proportional systems the number of legislators—not number in government (i.e. power)—is proportional to votes.  Typically the  3rd party by votes has much more power than the 2nd.  So even in who-should-rule terms, coalition systems deliver the opposite of what they promise.
1206549680659804161 2019-12-16 12:20:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @IlariLehti @RandyVegetables @Crit_Rat Because the ruling party is always on a knife edge of losing power to the opposition, and if it does, its politicians get nothing. In coalition systems, leaders of unpopular parties often get into government. Sometimes because the electorate has moved towards an opposing opinion.
1206545203596800000 2019-12-16 12:02:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @IlariLehti @RandyVegetables @Crit_Rat For example: the more conducive a voting system is to coalition governments, the more incentive politicians have to devote creativity to gaining status within their party rather than to making the party itself more attractive outside its small core of supporters.
1206537065665617921 2019-12-16 11:30:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @IlariLehti @RandyVegetables @Crit_Rat In that case, why are there no arguments against the latter that don't mention who-should-rule?
1206535551924539392 2019-12-16 11:24:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @IlariLehti @RandyVegetables @Crit_Rat It is a question that begs for an authoritarian answer. It leads to the entrenchment of bad ideas and paralysis in political thinking.
1206534511682621440 2019-12-16 11:20:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @IlariLehti @RandyVegetables @Crit_Rat There is a theory in political philosophy that rejects the question "who should get to choose" as a chimera.

1205623484057042944 2019-12-13 23:00:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @gimmingham Not auto by-election: we elect MPs, not parties. Only elections should remove them. Also, 'automatically' sounds utopian.
1205493807418150912 2019-12-13 14:24:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FrancisCWolfe Being against a type of measure does not imply thinking that all legal frameworks under which it might be enacted are equally bad.
1205482436307623938 2019-12-13 13:39:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> A Referendum Act? That any Act of Parliament setting up a referendum must include the legislation that a yes vote would bring into effect. Parliament cannot bind itself, but this would make it explicit when it was reneging, or intending to.
1205482435120680960 2019-12-13 13:39:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Legislating that only an Act of Parliament (not the Commons, nor Supreme Court nor the Speaker) can change the scope of the Prerogative?

If you mean do the results apply to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, the Bekenstein bound rules those out for spatially finite systems.

1203611323038388224 2019-12-08 09:44:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I have the impression that "bored of" has greatly increased since 2008. But perhaps it can still be stopped…  https://t.co/3BANYvlKaZ

1203445238704021507 2019-12-07 22:44:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RokoMijicUK @michael_nielsen Decoherence not needed for that. The 'Born rule'  is simply false under almost all circumstances and becomes methodologically useful under a few. As the decision theory argument proves.
1203428019047747585 2019-12-07 21:36:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RokoMijicUK @michael_nielsen That question could mean several things, but the basic one, which is the only one with philosophical relevance, is answered by Everett. See Chapter 2 of The Fabric of Reality.  See also  https://t.co/nRYeBoeaxH Subtler aspects are answered by decoherence theory.
1203312950062276609 2019-12-07 13:58:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes that's one trouble with optimising.  Another trouble (in the case of AGI) is that there's no computable criterion for success. The only halfway decent judge of AGI-ness is another AGI who chooses to be one.

1202290589242478593 2019-12-04 18:16:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ganesh__s @joebosphilos To carry through a beneficial long-term project which will do harm in the short term, a party has to persuade the electorate that this is worth it.  And that is exactly how matters should stand: if they can't persuade a plurality to try it, it shouldn't be tried until they can.
1202273014915747847 2019-12-04 17:06:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In this video I explain my views about Brexit and related matters in more detail:
1202239758757515264 2019-12-04 14:54:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Amazing.
1202163495908888576 2019-12-04 09:51:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @josephclawrence @adamjohnsonnAJ Yes. Even understanding existing knowledge, in what seem to us simple cases, requires human-level creativity.
1201932105267200000 2019-12-03 18:31:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JonClap The words express the theory that would inform policy. Though other things would inform policy too, the fact that the theory is extremely false as well as spiteful is important.
1201847819025502208 2019-12-03 12:57:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamjohnsonnAJ Irrelevant, therefore, to the issue of whether there can be qualia without creativity, since e.g. people may have theories of knowledge that neglect unconscious or inexplicit knowledge, and therefore report not being creative (or even not thinking at all) when in fact they were.
1201841135859187712 2019-12-03 12:30:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidRobinow @ProfDBernstein Karl Popper, a philosopher.  https://t.co/4by0x90aOr
1201826232125534208 2019-12-03 11:31:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ProfDBernstein It's just the *prevailing, commonsense* theory of knowledge—e.g. that the truth is manifest; that there are reliable sources of it.  Yes, it's preposterous. But almost everyone assumes it uncritically except in narrow areas.  It's as if Popper had never existed.
1201822401497092096 2019-12-03 11:16:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamjohnsonnAJ Self-reporting, especially by people with a different theory of knowledge, and therefore of what creativity is, can't be relevant.
1201821340996640768 2019-12-03 11:11:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamjohnsonnAJ It's conceivable that future explanations will reveal that they're separate, or that either or both don't really exist.  Yet both seem inextricable from human decision making. How would they (or worse, the semblance of them) ever have evolved without the demands of that role?
1201595468385525760 2019-12-02 20:14:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Gomboc20 @GoonerBilo Like all the other groups: hard work; no opportunity to reflect; heavy responsibilities; all the time.
1201515845828141061 2019-12-02 14:57:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @GoonerBilo Much more terrifying, though, is the thought of any of those groups being abolished by law.
1201515304670695425 2019-12-02 14:55:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ReachChristofer Yes.
1201444472409772037 2019-12-02 10:14:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @GoonerBilo I find the very thought of being a billionaire, a policeman, a surgeon, an MP… horrifying, but I'm fervently in favour of such people existing.
1201439949469474816 2019-12-02 09:56:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @god_theory When I read 20th century economists claiming that people only buy washing machines in order to show off to the neighbours, I often wonder whether any of them had ever washed his own shirt.
1201433491986165760 2019-12-02 09:30:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @GoonerBilo Fundamental  research, by definition, involves aspiring for something one can't yet even imagine.  And qualitatively, not just quantitatively.

1201239170003460097 2019-12-01 20:38:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Soph8B I don't understand the question, but I don't think we appear hard-wired to have any particular notion. All notions are mutable.
1201141923475525634 2019-12-01 14:12:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cm_richards That Corbynism would be an economic catastrophe is not a coincidence. The Pattern is not just racism, harming its direct targets. It is a very broad corruption of morality. This is why disparate evil doctrines—Marxism, Fascism, Islamism, Chavismo, Corbynism—unite in adopting it.

1200907136546590720 2019-11-30 22:39:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DorianKBandy So if you're ever on a forced march, and the sergeant is yelling (LeftRight)(LeftRight)(LeftRight)… mentally convert to: (LeftRightLeft)(RightLeftRight)… He'll never know, and you'll have a better chance of surviving.
1200841087969050624 2019-11-30 18:16:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And the same moral applies to AGI-phobia too.
1200813958791335937 2019-11-30 16:28:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. And it's pretty clear from the book that Mary was in sympathy with her father's (William Godwin's) educational philosophy.
1200530114678685696 2019-11-29 21:40:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Soph8B The main mystery is not where it came from but why it persists over millennia and very different cultures.  I doubt religion is involved. Both atheists and believers (including Jews) often legitimise hurting both atheistic and believing Jews.
1200488980032167936 2019-11-29 18:57:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamkwiatkows11 Is "over focusing" a good term for falsely accusing people of GENOCIDE?  Such an accusation legitimises violence against those people, doesn't it?  Especially when done as part of a widespread Pattern.
1200485852486479872 2019-11-29 18:45:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamkwiatkows11 Yes. But again, why isn't there a separate term for "focusing on"—i.e. having a passion for grotesquely libelling—Israelis e.g. by accusing them of genocide?  (I avoid the term 'antisemitism' because it embodies a false theory of what the Pattern is.)
1200430397588463617 2019-11-29 15:04:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamkwiatkows11 One might start with this question: Is there a word for propagating grotesquely hyperbolic and spiteful libels about Israelis? E.g. that they commit genocide?
1200418709258547205 2019-11-29 14:18:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Whether that "spells much worse times ahead" – will depend on how the arguments go. Those mainstream values are powerful and resilient too.
1200369590909448197 2019-11-29 11:03:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Freedland But it's not *that* rare currently. Here are several examples of public figures (former Labour MPs) who have changed by more:  https://t.co/XiYIYjkW7q

1200067326391062531 2019-11-28 15:02:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> For example, I'm talking about fixing this:  https://t.co/9oRHsCfswV
1199985117613187072 2019-11-28 09:35:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @thoughtcrim Indeed. Page 40 and not shouting about it? It's important! If they succeed in creating that mentality, it could be the only 2019 policy that's remembered in a decade or two.
1199832737533825024 2019-11-27 23:29:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I'm not talking about the doubling, but about "high-risk high-payoff". Exactly what's needed. I haven't actually read the manifesto yet. But why isn't this big news?
1199832268820402176 2019-11-27 23:27:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> He says the Conservative manifesto includes: "a new high-risk high-payoff research agency, modelled on ARPA and funded by an unprecedented DOUBLING of the basic science budget" Wow. That would directly solve many of the chronic problems of UK research funding.
1199785360731115521 2019-11-27 20:21:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @quentin_vole @DanielJHannan Yes. Some will be.  Slightly absurd that there are observers from all sides at polling stations and at the counts, but not at postal voting.
1199783841394839554 2019-11-27 20:15:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @stokel @newscientist The theory that they had an impact was inherently flawed, taking the form "we can't persuade them of the manifest truth because they are so gullible".
1199693531318607873 2019-11-27 14:16:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JMcG____ @Crit_Rat It is.  Perhaps Popper's theory of knowledge? E.g. the essay The Bucket and the Searchlight in his book Objective Knowledge.

1198973337931862016 2019-11-25 14:34:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JRubinBlogger @EvanMcMullin One consideration is that in a democracy, the rulers fear the next election. The more they fear anything else, the worse the democracy.

Some mathematical objects, e.g. number theory, are infinitely deep. Neither humans nor robots will ever fully grok it. But there's no limit to how much humans, or AGIs, could grok.

1197796775798673408 2019-11-22 08:39:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HumanProgress How many lives are lost due to the precautionary principle? Unknowable. But the worst case scenario is: all of them.
1197676476130299904 2019-11-22 00:41:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @michael_nielsen Interesting point. Cf.  @aubreydegrey
1197605935021264897 2019-11-21 20:01:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Depends how one counts 'approaches'. Arguably the light blue one at the bottom is a second approach. But yeah, very dangerous.
1197603440425353217 2019-11-21 19:51:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Excellent. More such ideas, please. It would be dangerous to rely on just one, even an excellent one, let alone the bad one that's current policy.

1197227774089551877 2019-11-20 18:58:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich Shameful that Britain is one of them.

1197137595421069312 2019-11-20 13:00:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Evidence is rarely decisive, and only ever when good arguments have already explained why it should be.
1197137594284486657 2019-11-20 13:00:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In reality, people are swayed by *arguments* that address their existing positions and provide ones that are preferable by their lights.
1197137592761933826 2019-11-20 13:00:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> One can't at the same time complain that people are impervious to evidence and that they are swayed by 'fake' facts.

1196727503513145345 2019-11-19 09:50:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes @FallingIntoFilm His excuse is: 'It's none of our business, it's no threat to us if foreigners oppress and kill each other'.  The two overlap in specious arguments like: 'Who elected us as the world's policeman?', and 'We should be spending money at home, not abroad.'
1196704362451677184 2019-11-19 08:18:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It wasn't an isolated blunder. It was isolationism, a catastrophic yet popular policy on which Presidents Obama and Trump were both elected.
1196466766106509312 2019-11-18 16:34:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jwesamuel @BSeradjeh @paul1andrews @MatjazLeonardis @michael_nielsen It's not that some areas make more progress under force/coercion/hurting (i.e. 'top-down') and some under consent/persuasion/fun. It's that there are areas where institutions of consent are absent or imperfect and the knowledge of how to create or improve them doesn't exist yet.

1196032241387872256 2019-11-17 11:48:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JeremosCollins @RichardDawkins They all have the fatal flaw that Popper points out: that they make governments less vulnerable to small changes in opinion than under FPTP.  Being 'fair' to MPs is pointless if it makes coalitions more likely and hence *governments* less accountable.
1196018791639142403 2019-11-17 10:54:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichardDawkins Karl Popper was well-meaning, rational, and the 20th century's greatest philosopher of democracy.  https://t.co/Y5lDYcgkW9
1195786431400161283 2019-11-16 19:31:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richarddorset Markets are creative; engines aren't. That's a huge difference. But in regard to relating efficiency and optimality the analogy is near perfect.
1195777549802061825 2019-11-16 18:55:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> A near-perfect analogy. Almost no waste...
1195691480981094400 2019-11-16 13:13:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @twatschmitt Traditions of criticism can't be *inherently* unstable, because there are known examples that have lasted for centuries.
1195472247936430081 2019-11-15 22:42:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PSTaylor13 If true, it can't help being that.
1195469459240243200 2019-11-15 22:31:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Maybe platitudes can't stand up against incivility, aggressiveness and insult.
1195469458195783681 2019-11-15 22:31:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But maybe that stops working when the mainstream factions, though civil, are complacent, stop taking ideas seriously, and use platitudes and slogans rather than argument and good explanation.
1195469457088487424 2019-11-15 22:31:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Conjecture (thread): Traditions of criticism are civil, and stable against incivility because, against that background, the uncivil make fools of themselves.

1194595398284959745 2019-11-13 12:38:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FallingIntoFilm @michael_nielsen It can't be true that most transformative innovations are brought about by governments. They would have to have impossible, prophetic knowledge of which innovations are going to be transformative—and before anyone else knows, too. If they had that, they wouldn't need taxes!

1194298213521645572 2019-11-12 16:57:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen All the more reason for using many, diverse methods in parallel, instead of relying on enforcing just one.  One that has known devastating effects if applied to the extent that would actually reduce the temperature.

Getting global parameters exactly right will be less important, and less contentious than at the present extremely crude level of relevant knowledge and technology.

1191358614574968832 2019-11-04 14:16:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick Indeed. But is it really saying that the Wannsee Conference (January 1942) and the Final Solution were already being planned in June 1940 when, for instance, the Nazis were still permitting/forcing Jews to emigrate?
1191276695023751168 2019-11-04 08:51:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HeuristicWorld Present in a mind, enacted as behaviour, consequently recreated in another mind, enacted as behaviour.
1191089797802143745 2019-11-03 20:28:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @pmathies @michael_nielsen Yes that's right.
1190610996487958530 2019-11-02 12:45:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan This idea that becoming a billionaire makes everyone else poorer is the same misconception as that inflation makes everyone richer.
1190610850115178496 2019-11-02 12:45:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan With hyper-inflation, everyone will be a billionaire, and Corbyn can confiscate absolutely everything.
1190568025168187393 2019-11-02 09:55:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WalkerMarcus @DanielJHannan No. It's essential to democracy that the losers consider the winners *legitimately* in charge. And that the winners accept that the losers may be in charge one day.

1188800830675308550 2019-10-28 12:52:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HumanProgress Ambiguous about percentages. If p(y) is the proportion in year y, this could mean p(2015)=0.7p(2001) or p(2015)=p(2001)-0.3.
1188750656280154114 2019-10-28 09:33:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> When talking about ideas, talk about their content not their proponents.
1188750655156080647 2019-10-28 09:33:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> No one really thinks they're valid arguments. They're signals of group loyalty and hence of the principled rejection of argument in regard to the issue in dispute.
1188750654170456064 2019-10-28 09:33:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> There’s a lot more wrong with ad hominem/identity-based arguments than merely that their premises do not imply their conclusions.

1188088936612204545 2019-10-26 13:44:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Illogical. The Labour Party has the power to take (the tendentiously named) "no deal" off the table today.  Instead they're going for indefinite delay.
1187666701799886848 2019-10-25 09:46:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's being reported in a way that fudges the difference between "I condone violence to achieve my objective" and "I won't abandon my objective just because it might make some others violent".  Chalk and cheese.

But the key is: the environmental movement only ever advocates spartan, sumptuary measures.  So I guess that many of them would be the same ones they advocate now, with different rationalisations.

Still, the fact that e.g. group-selection ideas are still a thing shows they they don't know, and aren't conveying, *why* it's right.

1177641304634859526 2019-09-27 17:49:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CarbonToffset That's true of general elections. If the outcome one of those isn't respected, go ahead and riot.  But if politicians behave disgracefully and break promises, the remedy is, precisely, to persuade people to vote them out at the next election.

1176515507882725377 2019-09-24 15:15:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cgbessellieu The speech is categorically saying that "Eternal Economic Growth" is a fairytale, i.e. false. And therefore that economic growth must end.
1176384291653259264 2019-09-24 06:34:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Marquees_Bird All measures that could significantly affect the climate should be classed as geoengineering.  I advocate creating and applying as many of them as possible, each of them in moderation, to minimise unintended consequences.  In addition, we need to learn to mitigate the effects.
1176263283101360130 2019-09-23 22:33:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Indeed.
1176253223528804353 2019-09-23 21:53:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richarddorset You don't have to wait for the apocalypse to find hell on Earth. There are millions of people in it right now in poorer countries, plus millions more in hospitals everywhere.  All for lack of the knowledge that wealth produces, and the wealth that knowledge produces.
1176247674846228480 2019-09-23 21:31:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I don't think Kant's "sapere aude!" is a great motto for the Enlightenment, but it has its moments, and this is one.  How dare we? We dare to know—to create ever more knowledge and wealth—because the alternative is hell on Earth followed by certain doom.

Mathematical discovery: The same, except mathematical criticism doesn't usually include experiment.  In both fields, this is often followed by radical reinterpretation of what happened.

Indexical terms—like 'I', 'here', or 'now'—are just abbreviations.  If you're referring to qualia, that's different, in that we have no good theory of what they are.

The Cold War was not caused by "regional powers" but by the Soviet Union. It was not brought to an end by sacrifice on the part of the enslaved half of the EU, nor by the other half, but mainly by NATO.

1172521246761848832 2019-09-13 14:43:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Next time someone asks you how a radian is defined.
1172520640722755584 2019-09-13 14:41:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Soph8B We can't define anything before we have some sort of explanation of what it is.  We have no such explanation for any qualia. For example, one could not currently explain what seeing yellow, or undergoing suffering, feels like to a person who had never experienced them.
1172504785272102913 2019-09-13 13:38:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reversechapter @james_burnett_ @lonewolfdion @Soph8B @CarnunMP @DouglasCarswell I mean it is common for a species to have sophisticated attributes that closely related species lack.  The capacity to suffer might be one, as is the ability to feed off sleeping cows. Hence the argument from evolutionary relatedness is invalid.

1172059887385436160 2019-09-12 08:10:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dautingthomas It's currently expressed as a law of epistemology not physics. Existing modes of explanation in physics aren't suitable for describing knowledge.

1171699539633430533 2019-09-11 08:18:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @james_burnett_ @DouglasCarswell That position is tenable too. But it entails transferring all wild animals to controlled environments where they can't hurt each other.  Reasonable in the long run but too expensive at present.

1169578001610289152 2019-09-05 11:48:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Parliament is sovereign. Therefore it cannot bind future Parliaments. Therefore the Government cannot make treaties that purport to bind future Parliaments. Nor can Parliament order the Government to enter into such a treaty.
1169545867931652096 2019-09-05 09:40:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NickHudsonCT Yes.  And there are indeed economists who regard the economy as being about knowledge creation.  Which is illuminating, though I don't know of one who distinguishes mere useful information from explanatory knowledge, and hence incentives from psychological coercion etc.

1163788358021201924 2019-08-20 12:22:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @wheargild The analogue of letting the hostage (come or) go freely, and of not killing them, is not to set up a hard border.  And the analogue of "but the voices in my head tell me I must kill" is "but a soft border is against our Rules".
1163781656400093185 2019-08-20 11:55:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's the "If I kill the hostage, that's on you" tactic.

1161601385420546048 2019-08-14 11:32:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That is, despite the Climate Emergency, to prevent thousands of tonnes of carbon from being sequestered.

1147783611439034368 2019-07-07 08:25:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bnielson01 @ToKTeacher It's doubtful Einstein even knew of the Michelson-Morley experiment. It didn't lead him to Relativity  https://t.co/CzQ5y7e0JB
1147517450600288256 2019-07-06 14:47:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It is indeed an amazing and uplifting episode in history, briefly and movingly presented.
1146913143744094208 2019-07-04 22:46:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @enorris111 There's no 2-party *system* but it's uncontroversial that FPTP tends to reduce both the number of parties and the representation of all but two.  Of course nothing can achieve that during transition periods such as the current one, when the two main parties struggle to remain so.

1146535425550553100 2019-07-03 21:45:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @iamreddave Yes, those things and more. In regard to raising local concerns nationally, it's good to have an MP in sympathy with the politics of local voters.
1146532049936953344 2019-07-03 21:31:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @iamreddave Also, "safe" seats often fall, cherry-picked exceptions notwithstanding. When they don't, it's usually because the party is popular there. When that changes, they're no longer safe.
1146530666089263104 2019-07-03 21:26:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @iamreddave MPs are neither policies nor rulers. It's pointless being able to change your mind about your MP if your change of mind about the *government* has no effect, or even an opposite effect.
1146523122277003269 2019-07-03 20:56:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Well said. This needs to be impressed upon them.
1146518761035509760 2019-07-03 20:39:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> By the criterion of not destroying the means of correcting errors, non-first-past-the-post voting systems are even worse than EU membership.
1146349928777736194 2019-07-03 09:28:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal @RealtimeAI For a universal computer, computational architecture affects only speed and memory capacity. These are important for real-time applications.
1146021146527260673 2019-07-02 11:41:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JakeTheHuman28 @RealtimeAI Fixed. Thanks.
1146013777999122432 2019-07-02 11:12:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JakeTheHuman28 @RealtimeAI I don't endorse any existing theory of consciousness  https://t.co/mblrbTOMww but it's definitely not computational universality since that's a property of hardware, and in particular of all laptop computers.
1145959420779749376 2019-07-02 07:36:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RealtimeAI Indeed, before modern science, prevailing ideas interpreting qualia in terms of cognitive architecture were wildly wrong about the architecture (e.g. heart as the seat of emotions), or even impossible (e.g. homunculus theory; supernatural soul; vision emanating from the eyes).
1145953198018113539 2019-07-02 07:11:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RealtimeAI Because of computational universality, we can't possibly have cognitive-architecture-dependent qualia.
1145823198870691846 2019-07-01 22:35:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jprwg @RealtimeAI Apparent qualia. We can't? Well, maybe I'm overestimating the current capabilities of video game developers.
1145817892119879680 2019-07-01 22:14:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Leonidas_Cap @TaylorMadeBenji Yeah it provides the gold standard ruling on what other universes can and can't do.
1145812798745845760 2019-07-01 21:53:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TaylorMadeBenji Quantum theory rules that out.
1145806249272983553 2019-07-01 21:27:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hunchandblunder I guess qualia, moral agency, freewill, consciousness—are all aspects of explanatory universality. But what do I know? I can't program any of them.
1145687904393617409 2019-07-01 13:37:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jimwyman5 @RichardDawkins It doesn't matter where ideas come from originally—reason, emotion, ideology, dreams—what matters is how they're treated once they exist.  Ideas can be untestable yet still rational. But it's always legitimate to ask what a metaphor actually refers to. What it's a metaphor *for*.
1145684671906353154 2019-07-01 13:24:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichardDawkins Is there a testable prediction corresponding to the metaphorical suicide by sawing off one's head? Of the form 'if no-deal Brexit then…'?
1145463514963816448 2019-06-30 22:45:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mizroba Extreme? Moi? 😀 IMO any such usefulness—practical or by inspiring research—is only as good as the explanation that's tacitly implied.
1145261797349494784 2019-06-30 09:24:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Haven't read the Sunday Times article but totally agree with this excerpt.  Also, regarding the educational function of universities as primary is a deadly trap leading to many kinds of authoritarianism.
1144923126859534337 2019-06-29 10:58:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AntonyRG4 @DouglasCarswell So his view is that progressivism/neo-Marxism has "outlived its purpose"?
1144920637623951360 2019-06-29 10:48:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> He is greatly under-appreciated.
1144861830537523201 2019-06-29 06:55:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal There's an infinity of lacks. A lack is only problematic if noticed and thought bad/interesting etc. i.e. it *conflicts* with a criterion.

1144684024499187712 2019-06-28 19:08:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The same has been true of the term 'the Enlightenment' ever since it was coined. Roy Porter:  https://t.co/dQKEAEJgfZ
1144684023169671168 2019-06-28 19:08:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Mr Putin and the BBC take for granted that Brexit is the antithesis of liberalism. Mr Tusk thinks the EU is a bastion of liberalism, and the antithesis of oligarchy.  https://t.co/Nh4vgIHaOQ People call some radically different ideas 'liberal', don't they?
1144617372218793989 2019-06-28 14:43:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MarkoPuljiz @ToKTeacher A black hole would have to be spinning fast enough *in our past*, and continue till then.  I think the prevailing opinion is that none are.

1144270427105239040 2019-06-27 15:45:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BSeradjeh Tasks. And everything else via their possibility and impossibility.
1144232281923641344 2019-06-27 13:13:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BSeradjeh E.g. one of the central ways in which constructor theory expresses laws of physics is specifying how impossible tasks can be composed into possible ones. There's no analogue there with measurement, computation, or resource theory.
1144231200292253697 2019-06-27 13:09:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BSeradjeh That would be just as bad. The theory is about *tasks*, possible and impossible. Not constructors that can or can't perform them.  It is called constructor theory because it is, among other things, in the same territory as von Neumann's theory including universal constructors &amp;c.
1144202641045635072 2019-06-27 11:15:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AscendLandscape @Telegraph Right. Unless we find underground moon cows there, we're stymied.

1143840539575537669 2019-06-26 11:16:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> There is no such thing as raw sensory data. It's interpretation, and error correction, all the way down.

1142758311374282753 2019-06-23 11:36:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Vicious anti-Jewish discourse is not the norm (i.e. compulsory), but it has indeed now become acceptable in some mainstream circles.
1142720276960096258 2019-06-23 09:05:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Ed_Pointsman But if a Government does decide, exceptionally, to put a policy of theirs to the people other than in an election, and the people reject that policy, as happened in this case, then retaining it is a catastrophe, and even more alien.
1142719132749705217 2019-06-23 09:00:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Ed_Pointsman Referenda are alien to the British political system, and rightly so, since they put policy in the hands of people who can't be removed.

But this requires a reversal of decades of policy and many creative solutions to overcome entrenched cultural relativism etc. as well as practical difficulties as they arise. So it isn't addressing today's problem.
1141813700602597377 2019-06-20 21:02:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BSeradjeh @Yhufir @yaacovlozowick But statements of the form "you are facing a problem therefore you are bad" are not criticisms. Nor is "You resemble Hitler in some respects."
1141780047382159360 2019-06-20 18:49:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick A government chose to put them there rather than adopt the right policy which is what?
1141084156761427968 2019-06-18 20:43:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RealtimeAI Yes. Also, people (or the economy) don't only present each other with rewards and punishments in the first place.
1141081856626102273 2019-06-18 20:34:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RealtimeAI But it also depends on what is meant by 'respond'. In that framing it usually means something like 'obey'.
1141081367855423488 2019-06-18 20:32:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RealtimeAI Insofar as 'decisions' are not creative, they may. But those aren't really human decisions.
1141073455254790144 2019-06-18 20:01:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Alas.   Framing human decisions as responses to incentives is another harmful effect of utilitarianism, Bayesianism and utility theory in economics.

1139510392667987970 2019-06-14 12:30:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes Which would better serve to legitimise hurting Jews in the Middle East, complaints about Christians being hurt there, or concealing that?
1139488112869040128 2019-06-14 11:01:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Well, 'gradual' could be taken as meaning 'random variation of discrete replicators alternating with systematic selection'. But in fact each element of that could in principle be tested separately, to rule out diverse rival theories such as Lamarckism and spontaneous generation.

1139478660245872640 2019-06-14 10:24:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 How can it then be a scientific theory? By predicting something else, of course.
1139476447075196928 2019-06-14 10:15:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 That's a mistake. It's possible, and common, to explain without predicting. (Partially—but all explanations are partial.)

1139225423286538242 2019-06-13 17:38:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> True. Though ironically, if it had been a joke advocating milkshake attacks, they might well be.  So would it then rightly be a police matter?

This tendency is naturally harmless or beneficial but becomes very dangerous when amplified by education systems striving for the compulsory standardisation of ideas.

Because his explanatory theories reached that far but no farther.  Likewise Newton's explanatory theory said G is constant but didn't specify its value.

1137323059365498880 2019-06-08 11:38:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Very interesting interview.
1137312518332932097 2019-06-08 10:56:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidLoxley39 @elonmusk @michaelshermer This idea of flawless leader anointed by the flawed multitude to boss them around is a chimera which always causes tyranny.  Also there's no such person as 'the majority' with opinions, making choices.  After Popper, see the chapter 'Choices' in my book The Beginning of Infinity.
1137310601523408896 2019-06-08 10:49:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @eterpay History doesn't suggest ideas. Civilisation is no village. And we should aspire to a better future than boots forever stamping on human faces.
1137225072459034624 2019-06-08 05:09:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidLoxley39 @elonmusk @michaelshermer Popper argues that trying to solve the problem of misrule and tyranny with criteria for who should rule is itself a way to entrench tyranny.
1137216784283643905 2019-06-08 04:36:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @monojohnny @elonmusk @michaelshermer No "maybe" about it. That argument (against who-should-rule) is one of the most devastating and important of the 20th century.
1137122391501484035 2019-06-07 22:21:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @_FitCrit A visa is (deemed) a privilege but voting is a right.
1137120776627326976 2019-06-07 22:14:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @_FitCrit Same as the argument against ID cards? Officials shouldn't be demanding "Papers please" from law abiding citizens.  I expect that the type of fraud that is mentioned there can and should  be addressed in other ways.
1137064830697910273 2019-06-07 18:32:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @naveedafridi Every young person pursuing an interest of theirs (that is lawful) *is* doing the community a service.
1137053390285000705 2019-06-07 17:47:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So—his character is superior to young people's? Hoping to enslave millions is usually regarded as evidence to the contrary.

1136565560358162433 2019-06-06 09:28:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PSTaylor13 @HitMisAnthrope @newscientist Right. But it could have shown a lower bound, namely what the technology of 2019 (such as a 2ft dyke) could do.
1136353519697563648 2019-06-05 19:26:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @newscientist More often: they pull a disaster out of a hat that has little if anything to do with the technology being envisaged.
1136335326857912323 2019-06-05 18:13:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JakeTheHuman28 @AndrewYang E.g. The party voters can't be sacked for choosing bad candidates. Power but no responsibility. Also, cries out to be gamed.

1136312760885817344 2019-06-05 16:44:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JakeTheHuman28 @AndrewYang Haven't thought much about presidential election voting. One thing that's really bad, though, is Primaries.
1136281879068532738 2019-06-05 14:41:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @josephclawrence Unpredictability means some things can't be done. There's nothing inconsistent about that being so in a deterministic universe.

1135839747664949248 2019-06-04 09:24:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Delighted that The Beginning of Infinity makes several appearances here.
1135554070335430658 2019-06-03 14:29:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ReachChristofer @HigonnetRafael @RealtimeAI @sapinker Whether the theory that they are counts as pseudoscience is a separate issue. Ordinary errors can be very deep.
1135538067266293761 2019-06-03 13:25:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ReachChristofer @HigonnetRafael @RealtimeAI @sapinker I don't think political opinions can be genetically determined or predisposed in any important sense. That would conflict with explanatory universality.

1135280745512128517 2019-06-02 20:23:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NeotenuousApe Of course.
1135183639367553024 2019-06-02 13:57:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NeotenuousApe Could you make a testable prediction of some disaster that will follow if Britain leaves the EU on WTO terms?
1135181345590824960 2019-06-02 13:48:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NeotenuousApe All certainty, and all degrees of certainty, are irrational.
1135180915074916352 2019-06-02 13:46:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TobyJIB @krazyander @ToKTeacher @reasonisfun @DoqxaScott @Crit_Rat @MatMcGann According to empiricism there's no such thing as 'constrained internally' because all knowledge is derived from experience. Hence any constraint (other than from pure logic?) can only be the constraint of consistency with previous experience. Empiricism is false, root and branch.
1135155495373852672 2019-06-02 12:05:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The comments on this quote-mined clickbait headline show that it's had the intended effect of becoming fake news. (Namely 'NHS to be sold to Americans if Brexit'.)
1135085671436210177 2019-06-02 07:28:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Astride.

1134835662585249795 2019-06-01 14:54:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @krazyander @ToKTeacher @reasonisfun @DoqxaScott @Crit_Rat @MatMcGann If you begin with empiricist axioms you will get empiricist conclusions. That doesn't constitute an argument for them. To understand an anti-empiricist philosophy, you have at least to entertain the possibility that the world might make sense without them.
1134834565460168705 2019-06-01 14:50:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AkivaMCohen @MirabelleW18 Still doesn't capture the full absurdity of that antisemitism-denial. What are these "strategic reasons"? Where were they during the century of British Jews' solid support for the Labour Party?
1134556103684046848 2019-05-31 20:23:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JohnCleese @DouglasCarswell Indeed. Denying that, also denies the possibility of moral progress in a culture, since that entails being better at one time than another.
1134379988566859776 2019-05-31 08:43:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BlackwoodNC @avidpat Explanatory knowledge of history is possible.
1134195247276318720 2019-05-30 20:29:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nsivacki @1828uk @DouglasCarswell Ah yes, Subsidiarity. So, which decisions, formally taken by the Commission, are now taken by regional authorities?
1134170711566798849 2019-05-30 18:52:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @rowhoop @NickBushkar @realTomHa @newscientist The statement is literally giving credence to the supernatural. The dispute is about whether they were right to make it.
1134162654073905158 2019-05-30 18:20:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NickBushkar @rowhoop @newscientist You didn't prefix your assertion with 'probably'. You said that one can't omit it while wanting to be correct.
1134162074131685377 2019-05-30 18:18:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NickBushkar @rowhoop @newscientist So, you don't want to be correct?

1134159481208811520 2019-05-30 18:07:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @rowhoop @newscientist They could have left out "probably".
1134155812673327105 2019-05-30 17:53:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Their very poster proclaims credence for the supernatural.
1134155232135589888 2019-05-30 17:50:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nsivacki @1828uk @DouglasCarswell What EU policy has changed in the direction of decentralising corporate tax rates?
1134113119796678656 2019-05-30 15:03:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nsivacki @1828uk @DouglasCarswell When has it evolved in the direction of decentralising currency, tax, or language policy?
1134082127316824064 2019-05-30 13:00:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MonsieurBouvard Those are misleading characterisations of Godwin's philosophy. For example, it was strongly anti-utopian. So his policies on what should be done now must be distinguished from his speculations about what this would lead to eventually, when a lot more knowledge had been created.
1134077787122348034 2019-05-30 12:43:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @avidpat Has anyone calculated how much of the CO2 now in the atmosphere, and how much of its rate of increase to this day, is due to anti-nuclear campaigns?
1134005200006651904 2019-05-30 07:54:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DoqxaScott @Empirical @ToKTeacher Thanks. It's syndication by Project Syndicate.
1133990623357427713 2019-05-30 06:56:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Empirical @ToKTeacher He said a lot of false things, but Wikiquote says that isn't one of them (see under Misattributed  https://t.co/2TAJk9fKeO )
1133978130161512448 2019-05-30 06:07:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Quite so. Also:  https://t.co/9WbKyAxdkB
1133777293288071169 2019-05-29 16:49:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JeffNylen The second one. My arguments are in my book The Beginning of Infinity.
1133750287976607747 2019-05-29 15:01:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ScottTheFenster Yes, the US and UK systems are different in regard to what is expected of judges, senior civil servants and the Speaker.
1133712688427786241 2019-05-29 12:32:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell If one can detect, from a judicial decision, what the judge's political opinions are, something has gone badly wrong. Likewise for a Speaker.
1133693357056831488 2019-05-29 11:15:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Anyone know why they don't paint them vantablack?

1133640980438106114 2019-05-29 07:47:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Just an error – a fad, in fact. Will be corrected. Pointing it out is part of that.
1133629106313224192 2019-05-29 07:00:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Agreed. (Disturb.)

1133440254122315776 2019-05-28 18:29:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jeffd244 By 'problem' I mean an apparent conflict between two otherwise good explanatory ideas.
1133409548486754307 2019-05-28 16:27:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cole_kinson @SamHarrisOrg @naval @EricRWeinstein @MichaelMatcha @Kasparov63 @AndrewYang It assumes a looming population of uncreative people needing subsidy. All arguments for that involve mistakes like Luddism/xenophobia/pessimism.
1133331796521816064 2019-05-28 11:18:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crit_Rat Psychological studies of X around the world can't show whether X is an essential part of being human.  Currently psychologists around the world keep claiming that their studies show things they don't, yet making such claims is not an essential part of being a psychologist.
1133305714447966211 2019-05-28 09:35:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ozgun9292 @SamHarrisOrg @naval @EricRWeinstein @MichaelMatcha @Kasparov63 @AndrewYang Creativity is a property of programs, not hardware.  So if the term "human creativity" means creativity specific to humans, it embodies a misconception.  Humans and AGIs will be able to use technology to help them to create faster and more efficiently, just as humans already do.
1133277138835132416 2019-05-28 07:41:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cole_kinson @SamHarrisOrg @naval @EricRWeinstein @MichaelMatcha @Kasparov63 @AndrewYang AI is not qualitatively different from other technology, nor will AGI be qualitatively different from any other people.  Their advent will solve problems and cause new ones. The idea that the latter will be insoluble is the same mistake as Luddism and xenophobia respectively.
1133263668068659200 2019-05-28 06:48:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SamHarrisOrg @naval @EricRWeinstein @MichaelMatcha @Kasparov63 @AndrewYang Think of an unsolved problem—any unsolved problem. What guarantees that it will ever be solved?  Where is it written that today isn't the last day that anything will be solved, ever?  The argument from lack of guarantee can be used to oppose anything whatever. So it is a fallacy.
1133155205116248065 2019-05-27 23:37:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @SGerbies It does indeed.
1133147090836697089 2019-05-27 23:04:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SGerbies But yes, the Enlightenment in all its forms is a rebellion against authority, and casting religious toleration as its source is off target.  Let him who has never been off target when speaking off the cuff cast the first stone.
1133143709518893056 2019-05-27 22:51:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SGerbies Intolerance in the name of the Enlightenment has always been common, but rarely seems *stupid*. He can't think it does. So I suspect that, speaking off the cuff, he reached for an imprecise stressor.
1133132461741891585 2019-05-27 22:06:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SGerbies I missed that the first time. Was it intended literally?

1132930292803657729 2019-05-27 08:43:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal I think so. Somewhere you say we have to at least get the known values right, or something like that.
1132927061847412736 2019-05-27 08:30:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal Another small point: even in the rare case that we're trying to explain 'data', the solution often involves guessing that some of it is wrong.
1132925908564795393 2019-05-27 08:26:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal @bnielson01 Something like: a theory that specifies whether an objective has been met, or how nearly it has been met.
1132921339675926528 2019-05-27 08:07:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal @bnielson01 Unlike AI, AGI changes the objectives towards which it is thinking. There is no overarching one. Objectives are themselves explanatory conjectures.
1132909784930377728 2019-05-27 07:21:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BACDenniston @robinhanson By the way, observations never prove things. They refute explanations only in the light of other explanations.
1132909125229318144 2019-05-27 07:19:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BACDenniston @robinhanson E.g. "Decisions take more than 1s and are telegraphed by body language detectable by the box" would  be a better explanation.
1132900863431847937 2019-05-27 06:46:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robinhanson It wouldn't prove that at all. There's a reason you chose 1 second as the interval.
1132767276866912259 2019-05-26 21:55:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal As presented so far, it seems to lack a notion of *problem* (apparent conflict between ideas), which should be central IMO.

1132318125972774914 2019-05-25 16:10:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Dennis Sciama told of a cosmology lecture he once went to. The speaker began: "Consider a Banach space B". Sciama burst our laughing.
1132315670962741254 2019-05-25 16:01:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ARossP Including progress towards still better institutions which, I concur, will eventually supersede states. The idea that this could be achieved without creating a great deal of new knowledge is magical thinking.
1132307415813246977 2019-05-25 15:28:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ARossP This is a utopian analysis which does not recognise the differences between different states. The institutions of some states do indeed embody the most valuable human knowledge yet created, on which all progress currently depends.
1132218035710976000 2019-05-25 09:33:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ReachChristofer If they know of a way to have more fun, then they shouldn't need any 'shoulds'. Nor if they are trying and failing to think of a way.

1131872068524486657 2019-05-24 10:38:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Attlee did not compromise with the pacifists/Stalin-apologists in his own party when he insisted on founding NATO.  Nor did he compromise with the opposition when he founded the NHS.   Everything he implemented was tested in practice. Some was later reversed. Some has survived.
1131868391898263552 2019-05-24 10:23:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Her position on this has been thoroughly tested by her and has failed. Though false, it remains stubbornly rooted in common sense.
1131591079084666881 2019-05-23 16:01:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Michael_Spagat I don't know the rules but wherever the "hot hands" theory affects anyone's choices, such as who takes the free throw, then what I said applies there too.
1131587113324032001 2019-05-23 15:46:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Michael_Spagat No. Their results would be worse. They'd be getting passes under conditions where their shot was harder but their skill unchanged.  But if "hot hands" are real and players were passing optimally given that fact, the extra skill exactly balances the extra hardness of shots.
1131580352420564993 2019-05-23 15:19:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Given that the people concerned believe in "hot hands" and act accordingly (i.e. pass to players on streaks), don't both studies (original and corrected) both show that the phenomenon *does* exist?  https://t.co/KHRQvUFGHf The opposite of the claimed results?

1131198640280748033 2019-05-22 14:02:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yhazony Empiricism doesn't answer that question because (1) the problem of induction (an infinity of theories consistent with experience) and (2) new ideas often include guessing that our experience was mistaken because (3) all evidence is theory-laden. See Popper. Or my two books…

1122464520767705088 2019-04-28 11:36:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @kishkushkay @nytimes The @NYTimes's non-apology apology  https://t.co/eBP0TQELSb takes care — not to contradict the calumnies in the cartoon; and — to preserve the legitimacy of alleging them (publishing the cartoon was merely "an error of judgement" because "the image was offensive")
1122425279840956417 2019-04-28 09:00:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The satirised statement is indeed false, for the obvious reason. And for the same reason, if Westerners abandoned their fad of self-denigration and cultural relativism, large-scale immigration would be highly beneficial.

The reverse is far less often actually done. It's more often something one is warned off, pressured out of, or disabled from doing.

1121033459991031808 2019-04-24 12:49:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robinhanson @Crit_Rat Blackwell was referring to problems that are interesting, not "interesting".

1121026670385926144 2019-04-24 12:22:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. Moreover, in the usual way of things interest is detectable and importance isn't.

Even a long series of direct observations can be a hint that none of them happened.  For example, James Randi, as a teenager attending Spiritualist Church, became convinced that the miracles he was seeing there every Sunday weren't happening.

So secret warfare doesn't usually count.
1113793592152162305 2019-04-04 13:21:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dautingthomas Yes. For some algorithms, the efficiency is a function of the available resources.  E.g. there are many 'algorithms' (misleading term) of creativity with different applicability and amalgamating them would require another 'algorithm' that's only worthwhile for large resources.

This sides with evil, and casts the best society as the worst. All such conspiracy theories are false.

1108481679923052544 2019-03-20 21:33:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan Yes. Amazing that a text written in 300+ BC takes for granted that readers will be familiar with tropes still widely used today to legitimise hurting Jews.
1108049510981427201 2019-03-19 16:56:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The first five would all deny the legitimacy of hurting Jews. The fifth asserts it. That's what this is all about.

1104504247469727745 2019-03-09 22:08:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ChipkinLogan Yes.
1104480622280667136 2019-03-09 20:34:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tom_illusion @reasonisfun Yes. More than merely non-zero. As Popper points out, even ideas we'd normally call completely false generally contain a lot of truth.  E.g. If you think it's Tuesday and it's actually Friday, your theory still has the true implications that it isn't Monday, isn't Wednesday, etc.

1095226690001948672 2019-02-12 07:42:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @clairlemon This appeals to the wrong theory of evolution ("how does this behavior benefit the animal and increase its fitness?").

No Anglosphere country is even remotely vulnerable to takeover by totalitarian factions. This is much more of a risk in the EU. Many member states have succumbed to this within living memory.

1086275886100299778 2019-01-18 14:55:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ChipkinLogan @RSocPublishing Yes. But I guess that's fairly far ahead, and will require a constructor theory of knowledge first.  (Hand-waving version: knowledge is information that can program a programmable constructor.)

1086248503381233665 2019-01-18 13:06:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Quantensalat The technical term 'hidden variables' just means entities that violate quantum theory.  They make not only non-locality but all sorts of contradictions and nonsense obligtory.
1086247746946912288 2019-01-18 13:03:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Quantensalat These are theorems. They don't use, or have, loopholes.  But yes, this is one of several reasons why quantum theory just is 'Everettian quantum theory'.

1083792342535061504 2019-01-11 18:26:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hunchandblunder @robinhanson Right. A false *and entrenched* idea, otherwise why wouldn't it itself be gradually corrected?
1083690172754079744 2019-01-11 11:40:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher The egregious falsehood that there is some useful analogy between the Russian and American political cultures used to be characteristic of leftist conspiracy theorists but has now entered the mainstream.
1083370927780495365 2019-01-10 14:32:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robinhanson You mean it could be a false conjecture, not caused by previous false ideas in that mind?

1083015853187186688 2019-01-09 15:01:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The whole concept of bias is a misconception. So-called 'biases' are just errors. Thinking is error correction—which biases are not immune to.  Hence patterns of errors in the outcomes of thinking are not explained by biases but by whatever is sabotaging error correction.

1082282160718008321 2019-01-07 14:25:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Yhufir @GrayConnolly @clairlemon Surely no one takes the view that all winners of wars were in the right. E.g. for the Peloponnesian war I accept the losers' perspective.

1082277695025790976 2019-01-07 14:08:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Yhufir @GrayConnolly @clairlemon Because it's one of several important factors. E.g. it affects the behaviour of neutrals and potential allies. See  https://t.co/HwbLJqoi8S
1082194412166365184 2019-01-07 08:37:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @GrayConnolly @clairlemon So WW2 was won because Allied soldiers feared shame more, and death less, than Japanese and German ones? Seems implausible. Is there evidence for that?  Explanations I've read are in terms of strategy, tactics, logistics, technology, productivity etc.—and rightness of the cause.

1081891304051802113 2019-01-06 12:32:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatMcGann No, because it can be used to endorse any policy whatever. E.g. reallocate all research resources to virus research because Ebola etc might mutate into a lethal pandemic. Invade and conquer the enemy at all costs because they might be building doomsday weapons. OR THE OPPOSITES.
1081889874309992448 2019-01-06 12:27:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatMcGann By the way, M.A.D. was not a policy enacted by 'the world' but a description of the situation caused by various policies by different actors. No decision maker enacted it. Pretending/insisting they did is yet another example of confusion caused by utility theory.
1081620148673490945 2019-01-05 18:35:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher @trishankkarthik @dwnhogendoorn @normonics @stewartbrand @Selector7G @GuruAnaerobic @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb Yes. Where the probabilities and utilities are known (or bounded) is the case where decision theory *is* applicable.
1081564246088040448 2019-01-05 14:53:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @CoddingtonKipp @Crit_Rat In a deeper sense, they all are, to this day.
1081534921372590082 2019-01-05 12:56:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> One of the damaging consequences of utility theory is that it makes people *uncritically certain* that they have ways of extracting knowledge from ignorance.  Because (they reason) if there can be no such ways, there must be no such thing as rational decision making.
1081521577227886592 2019-01-05 12:03:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crit_Rat @michael_nielsen Indeed.
1081228303489531905 2019-01-04 16:38:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Where probabilities are unknowable (which is often the case in, say, political decisions), it's not the case that reason is ineffective. It merely entails a methodology very different from utility theory—among other things focused on institutional rules not individual decisions.
1081228302260555776 2019-01-04 16:38:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In particular, where probabilities are *unknowable*, there is no such thing as an estimate of them, nor even an "educated guess". Attempting those is then, at best, just scanning one's memory for prejudices, promised utopias and scare stories.
1081228300972900352 2019-01-04 16:38:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @trishankkarthik  When we know the possible outcomes and have an explanatory theory to estimate all their probabilities (and utilities) we can use decision theory to decide what to do: e.g. choose the action with the highest expectation value of utility. When we don't, we can't.
1081056735119446017 2019-01-04 05:16:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @stewartbrand @trishankkarthik @normonics @paulportesi Yes. Moreover, any action, novel or traditional, or inaction, or things unrelated to human action, could cause catastrophe, with unknowable probability.
1081043919016812545 2019-01-04 04:25:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @trishankkarthik @normonics @stewartbrand @Selector7G @GuruAnaerobic @yaneerbaryam @nntaleb But we are not playing Russian roulette. See The Beginning of Infinity pp197-8.

1080823556282478592 2019-01-03 13:49:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> TFW you realise that people often define 'rational' irrationally and chimpanzees never do.
1080709931995750400 2019-01-03 06:18:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Jediphone @reasonisfun I can't imagine what "creating an identity" or "encourage loyalty" could mean other than tyranny and monoculture. We need the opposite: loyalties should have to be earned; shared "identities" should evolve and emerge, not be invented and imposed from above.
1080607052081315845 2019-01-02 23:29:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @robinhanson @clairlemon Equally, if our "push" is unintendedly counter-productive we'll have done more harm than if our "push" for better behaviour is.  So there's no a priori reason to prefer one to the other. We can try to improve institutions' ability to correct the inevitable mistakes of both kinds.

1078936874352328704 2018-12-29 08:52:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If priests told children, authoritatively, that they are doomed to suffer in hell for their parents' sins, no matter what they now do, they'd be widely condemned, and not given a pass because they "sincerely believe it". Their whole religion would be widely condemned.

But in the following years it became the prevailing, relentless narrative.  It was false then, and is false now, and the underlying mistake remains uncorrected.

The population grows because children who would have died survive. And so there is no way to continue as before."
1078225910954901504 2018-12-27 09:47:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @atnan @quackingduck So that's what it isn't. What is it?

That would require an infinite regress. They are conjectures.  Newton's theory is not just equations. It is full of explanation, e.g. via a new notion of 'force'.  Einstein's explained why that seemed to be true but isn't.

Only then did their motion become data. (False data, as it happens, for it is the Earth that moves.)
1076468765964058624 2018-12-22 13:25:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lynz_h55 @TheHalcyonSavan @PSTaylor13 No, all observations are theory-laden. Theories choose what observations are made; theories determine how; theories (mis)interpret the results as 'data'. A problem consists of at least two conflicting theories, not necessarily about 'data'.

New data, old data, fake data, learning a theory, misunderstanding it, being taught, being lied to…  None of that is what theories are 'built on', 'derived from', 'justified by', etc. Theories are conjectures—not to be judged by origin.

Among known voting systems, 'first past the post' is the one that best meets Popper's criterion.

1076079287063756800 2018-12-21 11:37:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PSTaylor13 Not necessarily a model but at least a recipe. Yes, that's kinda von Neumann's replicator-vehicle logic.

1075833407547023360 2018-12-20 19:20:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Again, just as if Popper had never lived. Claiming that the brain is *literally* pyramid-shaped would be more accurate than that model.

1074681076268830726 2018-12-17 15:01:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell Parliament must agree a question. If the question is forced by one faction over the objections of the other, the referendum has no legitimacy.
1074657090139013120 2018-12-17 13:26:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @notsurethomas The ones who knew what it was about did. Both in the generalised sense of intense fulfilment and joy, and in the narrower sense.
1074646614357217281 2018-12-17 12:44:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @notsurethomas The advantage is in understanding quantum computation. But not, I expect, brains.
1074639221900627968 2018-12-17 12:15:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @akvadrako Interesting. Thanks. Do they sharply disagree on any choice?
1074638885542682624 2018-12-17 12:14:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @notsurethomas That knowledge forms large cross-universe structures in no way implies that interference or entanglement are used in its creation.
1074621306409283584 2018-12-17 11:04:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adilzeshan @davidarredondo @RotemEren @ToKTeacher Yes. But it's mostly not 'override'. It's reinterpret, modify or sideline.
1074618767282458624 2018-12-17 10:54:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TobyJIB Maybe. But this is a field in which wishful thinking is a notoriously powerful source of error  https://t.co/YR9aAl0Lp3
1074611477624045568 2018-12-17 10:25:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jlz0z  https://t.co/riiBAZTsBR I'd be wary of such surveys. Ridiculing the ignorance of the common people is a time-honoured argument against democratic institutions. As such it's a who-should-rule argument, authoritarian and fallacious.
1074537827436822534 2018-12-17 05:32:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Effective Altruism and Lomborg apparently start with the same premises, objectives and methods. Do they agree on any conclusion?
1074424164847632384 2018-12-16 22:00:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Eagerly awaited as usual...
1074405226654982145 2018-12-16 20:45:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal At a wild guess: it may contribute in some way. But not decisively.
1074403256179286017 2018-12-16 20:37:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @naveedafridi Art too.
1074384287552675840 2018-12-16 19:22:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @orzelc Unfortunately, they can only have done that vanishingly rarely, for the reason explained in Ch15 of The Beginning of Infinity.
1074381144857169922 2018-12-16 19:10:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Imagine if, 35,000 years ago, they'd devoted their creativity to science as well as to art.
1074306283807879169 2018-12-16 14:12:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WunderbarKassel @DehennaDavison @DouglasCarswell @Jeremy_Hunt Good point. The *actual* outcome will depend on many other factors such as Corbyn and future knowledge.  But what he means is: there is nothing known in the situation that could have a bad long-term economic effect, other than the subsequent decisions of the British government.
1074272156358504448 2018-12-16 11:56:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mattleifer @michael_nielsen Nor are electrons made of electron stuff.
1074271327991799809 2018-12-16 11:53:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mattleifer @michael_nielsen That's like complaining about Newton's laws that time isn't made of real-number stuff, nor gravity of vector stuff.
1074268578902360064 2018-12-16 11:42:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DehennaDavison @DouglasCarswell @Jeremy_Hunt Apart from transition problems – of course. It's bizarre that this even has to be said.
1073993237780750337 2018-12-15 17:28:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @realTomHa @omriceren Sometimes.   Or usually. Or occasionally. No one knows. But regardless, in a free society they always get to choose.
1073974485768921089 2018-12-15 16:14:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @omriceren No. Adults choose what they want to learn.
1073837619853832192 2018-12-15 07:10:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sphexish Yes. Or vice versa.
1073723657443336193 2018-12-14 23:37:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "It doesn’t always get much coverage in the press".
1073697392497700864 2018-12-14 21:53:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JohnCaradja Please tell everyone you know. It's reprehensible that the Government didn't proclaim this policy the day after the Referendum. But they have now, and almost no one knows about it.
1073693164773494784 2018-12-14 21:36:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JohnCaradja No. There's been disgraceful non-reporting on this matter. Read this, especially §§4 &amp; 7-10:  https://t.co/fuQdDTZFtY Also sign up for e-mail updates here  https://t.co/RlTybATy2o
1073659426832375808 2018-12-14 19:22:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crit_Rat @michael_nielsen Sad, yes. Physics education is to blame—but I wish I knew what, specifically, makes this stance so common and so resistant to reason.
1073632835003654144 2018-12-14 17:36:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen No it's true! And the same holds for JPEG: easier for some things (e.g. sending in e-mail), harder for others (telling hawk from handsaw).
1073604196031782914 2018-12-14 15:42:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cm_richards Yes, every plan does, including Re-remain. E.g. Mr Major's 1992 adoption of a plan to Remain in the ERM caused massive short term damage.  OTOH massive short term damage was prophesied for voting Leave in 2016 but never happened.
1073589757584859136 2018-12-14 14:45:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> One faction favours plan A (Re-remain). Another faction considers plan B (Leave Now, Deal Later) more beneficial than that. The great majority considers plan Z (The Deal On Offer) to be worse than either.  Only plan B tests anything. Only plan B will soon cause minds to change.
1073541763208544257 2018-12-14 11:34:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Ed_Pointsman @michael_nielsen See  https://t.co/htGKUFtqSj
1073533752050151424 2018-12-14 11:02:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Try the Heisenberg Picture. Using the Schrödinger Picture to try to understand what's happening in a quantum system is like trying to see what's in an image by looking at a compressed binary file. Compact, ingenious, but opaque.
1073474569846046720 2018-12-14 07:07:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @Nilartus @sjta_amy @Evan_McMullin The important thing is that whoever makes the choice be identifiable, and held responsible for bad choices (in this case, lost elections).
1073473674873847808 2018-12-14 07:04:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @Nilartus @sjta_amy @Evan_McMullin I know little of the history but I think it was the previous system: party leaders somehow chose the party's candidates.
1073460421024194561 2018-12-14 06:11:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dchackethal Science isn't a process of extracting theories from data. It begins with problems not data.  Nor is it a matter of choosing among many explanations. Explanations are very hard to create. Formulae aren't explanations.
1073456627339157504 2018-12-14 05:56:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Nilartus @sjta_amy @Evan_McMullin Abolish primary elections and revert to the smoke-filled-room system. (Without the smoke.)  Rational electoral systems know nothing of *parties*.
1073327833542475780 2018-12-13 21:24:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sjta_amy @Evan_McMullin Quite the opposite:   https://t.co/Y5lDYcgkW9

1073295044055052289 2018-12-13 19:14:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RotemEren @ToKTeacher Computational and explanatory universality. Memes in static societies can sabotage it. Also, we can choose not to use it.
1073294268964454402 2018-12-13 19:11:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SirAbegao @karin_kuhlemann We can't rely on anything; only try to solve problems we think we see. Memes aren't supernatural. But BTW  https://t.co/mnmcsXuenO
1073280637325467648 2018-12-13 18:16:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @davidarredondo @RotemEren @ToKTeacher Can supersede, yes. And can also supersede environmental factors. 'Supersede' i.e. 'render irrelevant', not 'outweigh'.
1073232176383168512 2018-12-13 15:04:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ConHome That's a who-should-rule question and therefore begs for an authoritarian answer (Popper). Our institutions assign various roles to Parliament, the people, and the Government. They should be judged not by who has the divine right, but by how well they facilitate error correction.
1073221795317202944 2018-12-13 14:23:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tjaulow LOL
1073220436496998400 2018-12-13 14:17:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And of every age.
1073217918635294720 2018-12-13 14:07:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I'd be more enthusiastic about this effort if the record of schools at disseminating knowledge of, say, algebra, or history, were less dismal.
1073201124402962432 2018-12-13 13:01:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RotemEren @ToKTeacher It can because the situation is utterly changed by universality.
1073177796153929728 2018-12-13 11:28:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ReachChristofer Depends what the classification is to be used for. I myself think 'the reality of abstractions' captures it better.  The way I use terms, my view isn't refined, isn't about substance, and is realism not dualism.
1072897912651333633 2018-12-12 16:56:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Sea7spray The very informative chart is by Bloomberg @business
1072895476939309058 2018-12-12 16:46:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I suppose if there's another referendum it won't have just a simple In or Out question. The ballot paper will contain this diagram and voters will shade their preference  https://t.co/KAKxm7Z6zU Then the outcome will go to the Commission for rejection. Then a third referendum.
1072888296601206784 2018-12-12 16:17:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bowmanthebard I guess Burke and Popper would agree on what the difference between British and Continental political institutions is.
1072879227966550017 2018-12-12 15:41:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bowmanthebard Popperians?
1072878183014457350 2018-12-12 15:37:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hurdsean Not sure what you're referring to. Is it the prophecies? Or the fact that there is peaceful political controversy? The former are false, and the latter is a good thing.
1072874705688846336 2018-12-12 15:23:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bowmanthebard We probably disagree on this but for example I consider this  https://t.co/5N9dtSTXte to be hard empiricism, old-style. All about rule-following and identifying what to trust; no mention of imagination, explanation or even theory.
1072868960779956224 2018-12-12 15:01:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bowmanthebard Yes, though, following Popper, I prefer to classify the political philosophy inherent in British political institutions as 'critical rationalism'.  That way we can keep the traditional meaning of 'empiricism': the utterly false doctrine that all knowledge comes from the senses.
1072867592014983169 2018-12-12 14:55:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MattBrookes3 @bowmanthebard He quit because there was a widespread opinion in the party and country that his approach to the Hitler problem had been tested to destruction.
1072834355834306560 2018-12-12 12:43:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Chrisfalchen A second one, whatever its outcome, would not undo this problem but worsen it.
1072833821475790848 2018-12-12 12:41:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Chrisfalchen Referenda are alien to the British political system because they dissipate responsibility by purporting to transcend the sovereignty of Parliament.
1072828026415710209 2018-12-12 12:18:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Error correction is the heart and soul of the British political system, both formal and informal.
1072814308642471936 2018-12-12 11:23:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @listojiten It is true. And the Copenhagen "interpretation" is that you're not allowed to ask that question.

1072482063096397825 2018-12-11 13:23:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @crostipunctus @reasonisfun @michael_nielsen @webdevMason @Meaningness It's the same with fiction. There is no such thing as passively 'being entertained'. Reading fiction is an active, creative process.

1072453165407191041 2018-12-11 11:28:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed, don't hold your breath. But do integrate this into your world-view.

1072271956093911040 2018-12-10 23:28:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen @webdevMason @Meaningness No contest. The former leads you astray without your ever realising it until someone beats you to the discovery. The latter is easily detected at the time.

1072220079197249542 2018-12-10 20:02:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crit_Rat @reasonisfun Yes, the institution should look to itself. In countries where "corruption" is deemed a serious problem, "anti-corruption drives" make no difference.  What makes a difference is building and strengthening mechanisms of consent.
1072213959976120320 2018-12-10 19:38:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crit_Rat @reasonisfun Deprive people of basic needs, and some of them may turn to crime or irrationality. Deprive them of morality, and they all will.

1071734252918722560 2018-12-09 11:52:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Maybe the whole Brexit debate is about whether "charted waters" exist  https://t.co/kYVrhEfOEu
1071621756086042624 2018-12-09 04:25:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Be_seixas01 @webdevMason Yes.
1071620475804106752 2018-12-09 04:20:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Be_seixas01 @webdevMason Well, it originates in the European side of the Enlightenment.
1071617695685247008 2018-12-09 04:09:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Still nothing compared with Israel though. There's virtually nothing you could accuse Israelis of that would exclude you from polite society.
1071616908791898114 2018-12-09 04:05:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Yes a much larger range of anti-American libels are not just condoned but socially rewarded.
1071613034349674496 2018-12-09 03:50:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Because the stereotypes generated by anti-Americanism are among the few that run no risk of creating outrage.  Anti-British stereotypes are also among the few, by the way.
1071544854017204225 2018-12-08 23:19:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Fair enough.

For instance, I expect that currently in France, sales of yellow vests are bucking the trend of decline in other sales. I haven't induced or abducted this from data on previous sales, previous riots etc, but deduced it from an explanatory guess about what's happening there.

1071155662388891651 2018-12-07 21:33:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Yes, if there were no algorithm for a constructor to collect energy systematically, then tasks that use up energy would be impossible.  But the corresponding task where the constructor is also given some energy, might be.
1071151777951768577 2018-12-07 21:17:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Yes. Cosmology depends on general relativity.
1071150196766191616 2018-12-07 21:11:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Too early for that. Haven't even reformulated general relativity in constructor-theoretic form yet.

New laws create new obstacles and new opportunities. The effect of the latter is deeply unknowable. The former much less so. This creates a bias towards foretelling bad outcomes.

1066290835522809856 2018-11-24 11:22:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mainwood_paul Well, *why* did she equate sovereignty with immigration controls, to the exclusion of independence of the judiciary; integrity of the Union; power to (de)regulate trade, etc.?
1066286843568766976 2018-11-24 11:06:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mainwood_paul No, it's vice-versa: the Remain ideology that Leave=racism caused her to interpret concerns over immigration as racist. The concerns didn't cause the ideology.

1065992907268792321 2018-11-23 15:38:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. The core Remain ideology is that Leave is Racism. That Leavers' stated concern for sovereignty is cynical code for racism. Hence the wild misconception that Leavers will ultimately accept any deal that ends "free movement".
1065975546692145152 2018-11-23 14:29:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cm_richards Entirely consistent with it. Sustainability was the underlying problem that doomed them.

1063385785720872968 2018-11-16 10:58:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @davidarredondo I don't think that the Pattern can be explained as a special case of some broader phenomenon (prejudice, hatred, scapegoating etc).

1063167195943976962 2018-11-15 20:29:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "As varied as possible" Really? There are about 1000 Sections in the Dewey Decimal system. At one book per school day that's four years just to sample all Sections.  Then, how many Sections can one take courses in, in a lifetime?  No. More freedom, more choice, benefits everyone.

That's dangerous because if it were true, violence would indeed be justified to depose X. Explicitly inciting it is then superfluous.

1062712344864792576 2018-11-14 14:22:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But more important: trying to rehabilitate Ehrlich's theory with this kind of argument is not climate science. It is not any kind of science.

His theory made the fundamental mistake of prophecy masquerading as prediction. Nor did Borlaug merely buy us another 30 years' grace: it's now 48 and there is less hunger than ever.
1062701748022923264 2018-11-14 13:40:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RJsnda @ToKTeacher Because however many of us refrain from being gang bosses, the gang will still destroy peaceful trade until stopped by force.

1061754876554817536 2018-11-11 22:57:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen @DanielSchrag It says that because excess CO2 takes thousands of years to leave the atmosphere, decisions we make now will still be affecting our distant descendants then. That is a nonsequitur and an extremely implausible prophecy.

1061323981381427200 2018-11-10 18:25:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Dam_Nuwen However, being proved very wrong about some facts has indeed swayed my opinion during this saga. E.g. I took for granted that the EU would seek mutual benefit in the negotiations. I was flabbergasted when they systematically did the opposite, just as Remainers told me they would.
1061321749583802375 2018-11-10 18:16:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Dam_Nuwen Epistemology &amp; political philosophy are not sciences, so it's arguments, much more than circumstances, that should change opinions about them.
1061222942086959106 2018-11-10 11:44:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @moritz_hoffmann @ElishevaAvital Ah! Thanks. I had a misconception that it could also be used to find people innocent.
1061219126306324480 2018-11-10 11:28:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @moritz_hoffmann @ElishevaAvital Wasn't the requirement to make decisions in accordance with “gesundes Volksempfinden” itself enacted in law by the legislature? Surely in every legal system, people whom a court is legally obliged to acquit, are rarely indicted.

1060931111243657216 2018-11-09 16:24:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> We seem to be very near the bleak choice between Chaos and Vassalage. My feeling is that we shall choose Vassalage, and then have Chaos thrown in a little later on even more adverse terms than at present.

1059962511762579458 2018-11-07 00:15:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @TheAnnaGat There exist very special patterns of threats (of hell, spanking etc) with the property that if inflicted on people (in a given society), they'll inflict them on others.  Most patterns of threats don't do this, as you said. One can't make one up at will. But they can evolve.

1057971691966603264 2018-11-01 12:24:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes but a much bigger problem is that the mainstream accepts the substance of both these as legitimate opinions.  It is only expressing them in taboo language that is still socially unacceptable.

1056636512702525440 2018-10-28 19:59:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen @arfon I suspect he was being tactful, fearing mistakenly that the British would be offended by the truth because they worshipped Newton.
1056635490152132615 2018-10-28 19:55:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen @arfon But that was nonsense. Newton's theory was overthrown in the fundamental sense that it implied false statements that were contradicted in Einstein's but not vice-versa.

1056614460796911622 2018-10-28 18:31:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @josephclawrence Presumably. Otherwise, how could painters improve on previous painters?
1056613597680451584 2018-10-28 18:28:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen @arfon Did Einstein even cite Newton? I haven't read his 1915 paper but I doubt citation would be necessary.  It does contradict Newton's theory though, e,g, by denying that there is a force of gravity.  OTOH superseded theories aren't necessarily "superfluous".
1056580476209651712 2018-10-28 16:16:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @josephclawrence To some degree, all knowledge is knowledge about how to create further knowledge, because solutions create new problems.  Not necessarily self-knowledge, nor self+reality knowledge, though. Especially if it's very good art.

1056416677661995009 2018-10-28 05:25:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> As moral relativism spreads, cargo-cult morality takes over: Ever more microscopic versions of *mechanically defined* infractions (discrimination, hypocrisy, wrongspeak) are passionately demonised and punished while actual good is denigrated and actual evil condoned.

It's not where one lives, but the speed of light that makes it hard to live as more than a type II civilisation even if one is technologically able to be a higher type.
1054790307160735744 2018-10-23 17:43:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion @BipedNi @TEDTalks @TEDchris @ApplePodcasts Quite so. Progress depends on creativity and error correction, not perfect anything (especially not perfect error correction!).

1054708102879166464 2018-10-23 12:16:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cinema612 @FlorianWinter @clairlemon Since people have universality, saying I am one expresses strictly nothing about me as a person. Just distinguishes me from an elk.
1054692781598367745 2018-10-23 11:15:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @FlorianWinter @clairlemon My name's there too. I have something in common with other people called that. The name's an attribute of all of us, but I'm not an instance of them.
1054617822729506816 2018-10-23 06:17:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @FlorianWinter @clairlemon A better motto than "I am not a number, I am a free man" is "There's only one of me. I'm not an instance of anything."
1054414053911736327 2018-10-22 16:47:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @Besmissen @whyvert Heh. Actually neither cause, chance nor free will are present in fundamental physics. Yet all are necessary in certain explanations.  (But in the context of this thread, creativity is a better term than free will.)
1054405501902094341 2018-10-22 16:13:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @whyvert In such cases, a trait 100% caused/prevented by how one's parents choose to behave would count as 100% genetic. 100% heritable. Right?
1054401899091423232 2018-10-22 15:59:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @Besmissen @whyvert Agreed.
1054401775992795136 2018-10-22 15:59:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @whyvert So—how would one classify a trait caused entirely by a parental behaviour that, in all known cultures, is triggered by a genetic trait in an infant?
1054393617819820032 2018-10-22 15:26:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Besmissen @whyvert Could be innate. My question would be: could it conceivably be anything *other* than innate or environmental (or supernatural)?
1054391325523656706 2018-10-22 15:17:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @whyvert They count as environmental, so that would be environmental advantages overcoming environmental disadvantages. But apart from those?
1054368422337888256 2018-10-22 13:46:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Besmissen @whyvert I think parental probing minds count as environmental advantages, which could outweigh environmental disadvantages. So—anything apart from that?
1054332476875780096 2018-10-22 11:23:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LiamTjia @whyvert And apart from them?

This makes communication easier but it also conceals false assumptions.  This can be a problem. It can be overcome, with effort, but it can also be exacerbated by things like motte-and-bailey-type specious arguments.
1054311193907789824 2018-10-22 09:59:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @whyvert Could anything other than innate aptitudes conceivably overcome environmental disadvantages?
1054038672188887041 2018-10-21 15:56:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bnielson01 @ToKTeacher @davidarredondo @DKedmey That causally autonomous regions exist at low resolution is essential to our explanation of how we see the world.  That other regions are not autonomous means we have to explain them differently. Not in terms of objects that think things, for instance.
1054017650127523841 2018-10-21 14:32:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TobyJIB @ToKTeacher @davidarredondo @DKedmey "Errors" could mean several things, but on pp454-5 of The Beginning of Infinity I describe a case where it would definitely happen.
1053945794737385472 2018-10-21 09:47:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DogDiogenes @DKedmey There are infinitely many natural numbers but none of them is negative.
1053904624929923073 2018-10-21 07:03:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher @davidarredondo @DKedmey Yes, but I don't call those parts of the multiverse 'universes'. Universes are the parts that are approximately autonomous in regard to causation and explanation.
1053880704847826945 2018-10-21 05:28:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey Basically yes. But e.g. parts of the multiverse where magic appears to have happened are not instances of magic happening. Because the requisite causality is not instantiated in them, only the appearance of it.
1053573533480218624 2018-10-20 09:07:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher @reasonisfun Also, that need not have been done malevolently in the everyday sense of the word. E.g. Santa Claus or Plato's noble lie.

The excess is enabled by institutions (of law, property, money etc) which themselves embody knowledge and information. In a free society, money is a system for coordinating consent to cooperate.

1052513856516489216 2018-10-17 10:57:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @clim8resistance Indeed. But how many of the rest are clear that it's a *good* idea?

1048463809978011648 2018-10-06 06:43:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Good. Yet there's still a strong, quasi-religious aversion to enhancing this effect by doing the same thing deliberately.

1048197105989406720 2018-10-05 13:03:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. Even though the idea that there are brains inherently more suited to one academic subject than another is false.
1048167693990481920 2018-10-05 11:07:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HilljoyTim @Herring1967 There's not enough information in the question to specify whether heaviness exists in the imagined scenario and if so, which is heavier.

1047605429931528193 2018-10-03 21:52:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JobyOtero (1) Sometimes people do lie systematically to themselves. Must one stay silent about that? No. What one mustn't do is use that as an argument that they're wrong.  (2) Yes.
1047391830692847617 2018-10-03 07:44:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AGFchairman @clairlemon What good is peer review if the peers are in the cult?

1047335334579752960 2018-10-03 03:59:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> An important event, in a sense. But will it end the reign of hateful nonsense?
1047192772044881920 2018-10-02 18:33:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson Sometimes people engage in *semblances*. Form over substance. Things that look and quack like criticism but aren't.
1047117066107596801 2018-10-02 13:32:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @1warrencollins Well, it's a party conference so you 'd expect to see symbols of the party's philosophy everywhere. And so you do:  https://t.co/cowhkpVE8i  Neither they nor their opponents have explicitly realised it yet, but the Labour Party isn't about socialism any more.
1047115427233579009 2018-10-02 13:25:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ernsterlanson Yes, usually.
1047115284648214534 2018-10-02 13:25:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cm_richards Yes.
1046836167956520965 2018-10-01 18:56:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @parkerm @reversechapter Yes that's a good example.
1046637291337371648 2018-10-01 05:45:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reversechapter In the realm of ideas, unlike in engineering practice, a useful edifice can be built on unsound or even imaginary foundations.
1046547291623096320 2018-09-30 23:48:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And so, whenever the predator hemisphere becomes aware of the prey hemisphere, a deadly chase begins and the head spins clockwise.
1046477707729612801 2018-09-30 19:11:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion Worth checking whether that's so?
1046475152882638853 2018-09-30 19:01:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Worth checking who's right?
1046158260586336257 2018-09-29 22:02:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @fieryfalliblist @MatjazLeonardis Because that how you get a result, and that's what counts because the result a Good Thing.  (I'm pointing out irony here. In case anyone's misunderstanding.)
1046155799901470725 2018-09-29 21:52:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis So you're saying…they knowingly inflated the penalty to an unjust level as a tactic, when they had a legal duty to behave justly?
1046116080496902144 2018-09-29 19:14:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HumanProgress Also relevant to immigration debates.
1046095966649102336 2018-09-29 17:54:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HiggsMacro Yes.
1046080546336645120 2018-09-29 16:53:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JordanTSack The idea of banning someone from doing science is repugnant. Especially if they are doing massively creative, groundbreaking scientific work.
1046068236851318784 2018-09-29 16:04:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BadHombreMarcoB Certainly not. God is telling you to buy copies for all your friends.
1046066751849594885 2018-09-29 15:58:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JordanTSack And your favoured remedy would be what?
1046064209224708096 2018-09-29 15:48:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. The announcement had the feel of an indictment for murder. Can this draconian intervention be in the interest of stockholders, or anyone?
1046039865882742784 2018-09-29 14:11:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Darth_Marenghi Valuing those cultural values and political traditions is often deemed 'racist' by cultural and moral relativists.
1046031482383478784 2018-09-29 13:38:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Darth_Marenghi 'Anglosphere' ≠ 'Anglophone'. The former includes some cultural values and political traditions.
1046028358939811840 2018-09-29 13:26:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mishtal @MirabelleW18 Nothing new. If it *hadn't* continued, that would have been new. What is new, though, are powerful ideas opposing the Pattern.
1045961592293261314 2018-09-29 09:00:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @evolvjj Yes. But not because someone punishes you for trying.
1045650287451680768 2018-09-28 12:23:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @calcott_philip @dela3499 @fermatslibrary Can't get a clear contradiction since the collapse interpretation is inherently vague. Pick one that makes specific predictions for all experiments (good luck with that) and it will contradict itself in the Wigner's Friend case.
1045631360738775041 2018-09-28 11:08:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @asglidden Maybe I'm just rationalising. Maybe I just *want* it to be false that the best possible future is a boot stamping on a human face for ever.  LOL just kidding. It really is false.
1045630551204528129 2018-09-28 11:05:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @asglidden Sorry.   I could be mistaken. We're all fallible, and all alike in our infinite ignorance, you know.
1045629880761819136 2018-09-28 11:02:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @asglidden Seems to imply that one's masters/teachers/trainers aren't normal social animals; can't love or respect; their job is to inflict anxiety…
1045627430478794752 2018-09-28 10:53:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @asglidden Pangs are bad. At best, whatever can be achieved with pangs could be achieved better without.
1045573543638040576 2018-09-28 07:18:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @asglidden Likewise for being 'taught' or 'trained' if those terms have connotations of deferring unpersuaded.
1045569789488451584 2018-09-28 07:03:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @asglidden 'Master' implies that you defer to these wiser folk when you disagree. This is a mistake. That they are *usually* more right than you doesn't mean they are right in the (few?!) cases where they fail to persuade you. If anything, the opposite is to be expected.

1045303625944363008 2018-09-27 13:26:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cm_richards All exams are harsh and all testing in education is inimical to learning. That's why I want the functions separated.
1045281674743951360 2018-09-27 11:59:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cm_richards Creativity needed. In some situations one might make the subject: "the weaknesses I perceive in Prof Jones's presentation of X". Where possible, phase out the certifying function of universities altogether.

1045250946727596032 2018-09-27 09:57:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @colemathis_Ool Nice point, but I think there *are* parts of pure maths relevant to moral philosophy e.g. logic. And parts relevant to nothing we know of.
1045240715838672896 2018-09-27 09:16:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @colemathis_Ool Pure mathematics is about abstractions and the relationships between them. Theoretical science tries to find abstractions that correspond to reality. Experimental science tries to find ways of testing how well or badly that correspondence holds.
1045238750077505536 2018-09-27 09:08:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Universities should put their own house in order rather than try to ban free speech and association  https://t.co/WfvVe00ICA  A course that can be gamed with fake essays should be regarded as a fake course.

1044947613181784065 2018-09-26 13:51:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MirabelleW18 Except that Kavanaugh hasn't been in absolute control of the Supreme Court for 70 years relentlessly defending Roe.
1044946004741697536 2018-09-26 13:45:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @fermatslibrary More like making heavy weather of denying it, I think.

Belief is not a good relationship between a person and an idea. I tentatively reject that structure of thought.  But surely it's not true that, e.g. no one has ever benefitted from consulting their priest.
1044800618731384832 2018-09-26 04:07:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> An important criticism of an excellent critic.
1044780501108740096 2018-09-26 02:47:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ESYudkowsky @primalpoly So, yes?
1044663195141656576 2018-09-25 19:01:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> ‘What is the best way to stay safe in Sweden?’
1044543330263097345 2018-09-25 11:05:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ytspar Indeed. In the 1990s when people with PCs complained about Microsoft's 'monopoly' I would point to my Mac and ask what they were talking about.

1044458577904177153 2018-09-25 05:28:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @primalpoly @ESYudkowsky Or is it because studies have shown that therapists who don't are less effective?  Or less effective per unit time? Per dollar?
1044458032900591616 2018-09-25 05:26:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @primalpoly @ESYudkowsky Why? Is it because therapists who don't are liable to try in vain to change traits that are actually inborn?
1044362615718375426 2018-09-24 23:07:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MarkoPuljiz Yes—the solution he rejects and the one he endorses differ only in irrelevant details. See my paper Quantum Mechanics Near Closed Timelike Lines.
1044360263175213056 2018-09-24 22:57:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Is "inpatient fantasies" a rather poignant typo?
1044299267073069056 2018-09-24 18:55:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tomhfh I'd find this more worrying if I thought that schoolteaching is effective.
1043765571190435841 2018-09-23 07:34:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HiggsMacro Not sure I entirely agree with that characterisation. But see  https://t.co/Jva6qxZKSN
1043760899432108033 2018-09-23 07:16:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Many who are worried about the downsides of immigration are weirdly fatalistic about multiculturalism, the source of all those downsides.

1042694706138890242 2018-09-20 08:39:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Jaffui Using the everyday meaning of 'interesting' and the Popperian meaning of 'problem'. Not defining anything.  About solubility, see The Beginning of Infinity.
1042686193153069056 2018-09-20 08:05:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SDUPRE @MatMcGann They *could*. But it's easier when there's a 'division of labour'. See Milton Friedman's argument that no one knows how to make a pencil.
1042685324609179650 2018-09-20 08:02:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Jaffui Doesn't that lead to an infinite regress?

1041709963150852096 2018-09-17 15:26:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @felizkemal But not between 'can' and can't'. Which can … be serious.
1041687306846064642 2018-09-17 13:56:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @felizkemal But I do concur with him that the multiverse can't explain fine tuning.

1040952001625026561 2018-09-15 13:14:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Strangely, I can't tell which party is meant by which description. I can't fit any of the four attributes to either of the main US parties.
1040947692166369281 2018-09-15 12:57:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Seems less than the minimum, since they don't name the actual culprit of the transgression they had deemed worthy of a news story.

1040494135202009089 2018-09-14 06:55:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @webdevMason Yes. With arbitrary power, no rule of law, no human rights, no checks and balances, etc. Not to mention torture.

1040487635100332033 2018-09-14 06:29:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason People are trying to integrate schoolish values with the general values of society.  They're failing and making a mess. But the older way of handling this was also very irrational and immoral—but invisible, so would cause no outrage and there'd be no judge to dismiss the case.

Some people say that's because you're incapable, but that's just because they're mean. We'll shut them up for you. Now, all you have to do is like X and we'll have won!

1040184459486789632 2018-09-13 10:24:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @GaKePe Exactly. It does not distinguish between those two explanations.

1040180403317956608 2018-09-13 10:08:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Surprising? It is expected if (1) sex differences in personality are cultural and (2) efforts to enforce equality cause inequality.

1039504099069243394 2018-09-11 13:21:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bmcpburgh @DouglasCarswell Only bits and pieces I'm afraid.  https://t.co/qYFPMedWJX I've taken to recommending Hannan and Macaulay.
1039482497443225600 2018-09-11 11:55:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason 😀 Well, yes, those shots are richly deserved. But I don't think that's actually the reason fields get stuck in misconceptions.
1039477603005071360 2018-09-11 11:35:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason In academic fields, it is disturbingly common for entire fields to be in thrall to a misconception, to their detriment, for decades.
1039476084448870400 2018-09-11 11:29:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Not necessarily. What if the knowledge that the bias isn't true isn't yet known to anyone in the VC culture?
1039436852653170688 2018-09-11 08:53:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell You had me at 'incrementally'.  Though that's implicit in "Just do Brexit", so you already had me there too.
1039391726941687812 2018-09-11 05:54:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen I, too, haven't read it for decades, but I guess Feynman didn't realise that an event happening with a positive probability is just as nonsensical as its happening with a negative one  https://t.co/OwBA1WYLz8
1039388333590425601 2018-09-11 05:41:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @ToKTeacher @MatjazLeonardis @dela3499 The term 'knowledge' is used for two very different things *in ordinary usage*. In short: (1) true, justified belief; and (2) useful information.  Ordinary usage is therefore fatally confused. And the remedy is to realise, with Popper, that (1) is plain wrong on all three counts.
1039246785246576642 2018-09-10 20:18:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SteveStuWill @clairlemon Presumably they had explanatory theories too. Otherwise they couldn't rule out e.g. that the downed planes had a similar pattern but more hits.
1039192620856160256 2018-09-10 16:43:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis I think that's mostly true. But most people disagree with you. And these people sitting in Carlton House Terrace  https://t.co/rQJpBvGTt4 also disagree with you, but think that most people agree with you. Go figure.
1039129278892462080 2018-09-10 12:31:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> As a teenager I used to read Deadalus's column and rarely anything else in @newscientist  https://t.co/pYxnYnqDZP
1039120888782827520 2018-09-10 11:58:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Hear, hear. (Subject to security considerations.)
1039113074161209345 2018-09-10 11:27:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis I suspect that they *amplify* the various cultural effects that cause the disparity in the first place.
1039110939319173126 2018-09-10 11:18:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis With a captive audience one puts up '&lt;subject&gt; is FUN!!' posters to reassure *oneself*. But doesn't expect actual interest.
1039040108039753729 2018-09-10 06:37:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @anderssandberg Yeah, presumably stable orbits are for amateurs. Hard-core civilisations engineer down to the bare horizon.
1039032130951700480 2018-09-10 06:05:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crit_Rat @ToKTeacher Interesting. But on the pro-hunting side, it takes for granted that 'good for the species' = 'good for individual animals'. And on the anti-hunting side, that dying of natural causes is preferable to being shot. Both seem implausible.
1038871935441166336 2018-09-09 19:29:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @commonomics First I've heard of it. A lot of these things are nice as critiques, but all are bad as foundations.
1038798206732259328 2018-09-09 14:36:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BretWeinstein The capacity for culture is. The content of culture isn't. My ancestors gave me blue eyes but they knew nothing of quantum theory.
1038532816617852935 2018-09-08 21:01:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @anderssandberg And how easy neutronium is to make computers with. Or even denser stuff.
1038531910744637441 2018-09-08 20:57:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @anderssandberg Depends how small you are.

1038483296559280133 2018-09-08 17:44:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @hermeticallyCld We should regard all explanations as provisional.
1038469669945049088 2018-09-08 16:50:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BrianMcInnis87 If I knew how to do that – even for a dozen people – I'd have done it already.
1038460998959673346 2018-09-08 16:16:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tvetera @anderssandberg Yes it would (if the heat death is unavoidable—it may well not be). That would be a reason for not making the time dilation factor too big.
1038458389746073601 2018-09-08 16:05:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @anderssandberg Gravitational time dilation.
1038457301517180930 2018-09-08 16:01:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BrianMcInnis87 At least, most of them will soon know whether their fears are realistic or not. To maximise the opportunity for this, I suggest trying whenever possible to convert the fears into hard, testable predictions, with numbers and dates.
1038456822129143808 2018-09-08 15:59:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BrianMcInnis87 Thanks. I do feel badly for the people who are currently in fear. But I think it's best if I keep doing my own work, rather than try to persuade people of things, let alone political things.
1038451760292089856 2018-09-08 15:39:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @pmaymin @HumanProgress Hmm. That's more like 'who is happy'.
1038451096065400833 2018-09-08 15:36:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @anderssandberg Or maybe they are rational and realise that prophesying the distant future is a mug's game. So they're optimising present fun by maximising subjective communication speed in the whole galaxy: living very close to black holes and travelling between them in relativistic dust motes.
1038422314931679233 2018-09-08 13:42:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HumanProgress Oxfam's perverse conception of wealth is at odds with progress. Constructor theory has a better one:  https://t.co/IpHBvk7Wfl (§3.9).
1038396119586402304 2018-09-08 11:58:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @zibeeb @ToKTeacher @MatjazLeonardis @dela3499 The tariff for importing tomatoes from Australia to the EU currently depends on the kind of tomatoes. E.g. 14.4% for tinned, peeled:  https://t.co/gTUz7oiLnp (plus service charges).
1038322971994214400 2018-09-08 07:07:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BillHarvey2 @ProfBrianCox That would be a perverse and unworkable rule of interpretation. Also, see  https://t.co/bXUzLBKuCs
1038322706125611008 2018-09-08 07:06:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @ProfBrianCox Is this ambiguous?:  https://t.co/bXUzLBKuCs
1038317565519507456 2018-09-08 06:46:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Well, there's no mystery there. But the dogs have to decide where to put their 'walls', so they are demon-dogs. (Maxwell's.)
1038203252620308481 2018-09-07 23:11:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Dogs reduce the entropy of sheep. Where does it go? I don't know, but ideally, into the dogs' brains and out through their mouths.
1038191563099320320 2018-09-07 22:25:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ProfBrianCox It certainy would do but his letter doesn't say that:  https://t.co/VmpZ1qYR9P

1037689744761737217 2018-09-06 13:11:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @specialenmity @RJsnda We do have liberty, despite both misconceptions and bad arguments. We don't have perfection, because – fallibilism.
1037628198673149953 2018-09-06 09:06:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Dr_Tad @clairlemon Good point. Noted.
1037605579848593408 2018-09-06 07:37:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RJsnda One of the perennial arguments against liberty is that reason is just another form of unreason: atheism is just another religion; a free market ia just another monopoly; profit is a form of theft; persuasion is brainwashing; fun "captures" people.
1037604552336392192 2018-09-06 07:32:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RJsnda Instead of using force to capture their attention, as custom requires?
1037459938514284544 2018-09-05 21:58:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mims I guess you could have said "I think it would be nice if young families got together and raised their children communally."

1037216991080275968 2018-09-05 05:52:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Political commitments can impair your ability to realise that a skin-rash treatment is not analogous to a gun-control policy.

1037050592760356865 2018-09-04 18:51:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The qualification makes the "full" definition empty. It contradicts (1) the full definition and (2) itself.
1036682310513569792 2018-09-03 18:28:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Quite. In other words, this employer doesn't have a results-driven mentality.
1036552218185531393 2018-09-03 09:51:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich In other words, that the current massive fad for competitive hyperbole is debilitating while it lasts, but not toxic for the future.
1036551743528738822 2018-09-03 09:49:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich Hear, hear! But I guess that what is happening is not toxicity but hyperbole, &amp; that in the event, forgiveness will happen as normal.
1036239418376572928 2018-09-02 13:08:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's a good thing "…that our flag was still there". Seems a good moment to retweet this.

1036215511737151488 2018-09-02 11:33:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Ed_Pointsman @seanmcarroll It's silly because however deterministic the laws of physics are, the creation of knowledge is profoundly unpredictable. Therefore that person would be replying "you will do what your future knowledge dictates", while what you asked is for them to help you create it.
1036213615962062848 2018-09-02 11:25:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Ed_Pointsman @seanmcarroll This is just te 'deterministic nightmare' nothing to do with quantum theory. The problem addressed by moral philosophy is that of what to do next, and why.

But no nuanced rationale for marking an achievement with a national flag is defeated if not all the participants were natural-born citizens.
1035881726470443008 2018-09-01 13:27:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Yay! But it doesn't show who won.

1035802176235421697 2018-09-01 08:10:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ProfBrianCox That's *less* nuanced.
1035801113021300736 2018-09-01 08:06:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jeffreywatumull Not familiar. Sounds like it assumes a subjective theory of knowledge.

The number with more than a given weight tends to increase.  Neither number is physically significant. Entropy is about the weights.
1035537496426340354 2018-08-31 14:39:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich The unification of the rest of the world around the policy of preventing the Jews' escape (Évian conference 1938) was also a determining factor.

1035498694173491201 2018-08-31 12:05:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Indeed, but it's an aspect of the *traditional* classroom ethos. The only modern things about it are the bad grammar and the attempt to justify the traditional harshness with a veneer of modernity, pretending it's about a contract.

1035094964945006593 2018-08-30 09:20:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @toadmeister @clairlemon @QuilletteM The idea that growing up better circumstances than others constitutes "privilege" is Rawlsian mysticism that makes nonsense of liberal values.

1034877259864260609 2018-08-29 18:55:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Phys Rev would have banned "papers on gravitation or other fundamental theory” if it hadn't been for the efforts of John Wheeler  https://t.co/Rf6igGCCJd

1034468611052765184 2018-08-28 15:51:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Claire_M @ProfBrianCox Fine by me. If released with that caveat in bold italic in the header of every page and 48-point bold on the front cover.

That evolutionary pressure from blatant, harsh social punishment would have shaped memes thousands of times faster and far more effectively than genes, and hence there would have been no evolutionary pressure for life-style-conformity genes.

If someone can't give consent (e.g. an unconscious road-accident victim) one makes a reasonable assumption of what they consent to.  But the case in this thread is not that. It's clear that the children unequivocally refused consent.

Rights (legal/moral) *at the time* are.  If you break someone's leg for fun, pay for all expenses and prove in court that the bone is stronger than before—you still go to prison.

1031505485462163456 2018-08-20 11:37:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @kaeshour @asbjornenge Interesting. Did your model include the *creation of new ideas* to attract new voters, which I think is a major driver of progress under FPTP?  And the *fear* felt by a FPTP government when it doesn't seem to be attracting them as well as the Opposition?
1031493973049782273 2018-08-20 10:51:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @asbjornenge The opposite is true. Proportional voting makes for parties committed to narrow bases, insensitive to anyone else. The British system forces parties to try to appeal to people outside their base.  But more important than that: governments are always in danger of losing power.

1029750431243804673 2018-08-15 15:23:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BoltzmannBody @LucACastelein No. It depends on whether there is a political tradition of criticism in operation, and on who is using it and who is trying to defeat it.

Many people participate in the former Pattern who would not dream of doing the latter.  Thus they sincerely deny being 'antisemitic'. That's why that term is confusing.

1025725235985829888 2018-08-04 12:48:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ShippeyGordon If a state is such that hating it is morally right, then it is strictly meaningless to ask whether that state 'should' admit its haters.  If not, then it shouldn't admit them. Their presence would impair its error-correcting institutions.
1025707664389627904 2018-08-04 11:38:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @benito823 Maybe 'rules' is the wrong concept. Under any reasonable pragmatic system, this  https://t.co/wleQomB8nS would be an open-and-shut case, but I don't know if one could formulate a *rule* with that property.

It would be suicidal in many situations e.g. a battlefield. Or as an immigration criterion. Guilty until proven innocent would be almost as bad.
1025419285731176448 2018-08-03 16:33:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @georgeawright I don't know, but so long as the public debate is polarised on this issue, policies will be too.

1025397529121312769 2018-08-03 15:06:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey It means 'admit people who either do, or would if they could, persecute people in the first group, either in their own countries or here'.

1025365027488972800 2018-08-03 12:57:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @mwirth525 I don't think "include people who love the country and follow the laws that exclude them" is self-consistent. But yes it may be the stated position of some people.
1025358409422524417 2018-08-03 12:31:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The immigration debate is polarised between 'exclude people who love the country' and 'admit people who persecute them for that'.

1023961085609758720 2018-07-30 15:58:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @anderssandberg Excellent.
1023898527230058496 2018-07-30 11:50:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nbeecherp @mitchell_jed @tjaulow Maybe the widespread blindness to the issue of pain relief in childhood vaccinations is due to their iconic status in apologetics for coercion in general.
1023889836237901829 2018-07-30 11:15:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tjaulow @ToKTeacher @nbeecherp @mitchell_jed How would they even know?

1023632238913748992 2018-07-29 18:11:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nbeecherp Only distantly. Curricula, and classes for hours each day, days each week, years at a time, are very hard to make voluntary. If it were known how to do this, cinemas would run lessons instead of movies.
1023562370814226432 2018-07-29 13:34:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @zarzuelazen @dela3499 Thanks. Good to hear. I hope it works!

1023513613703815168 2018-07-29 10:20:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ShippeyGordon Unfortunately there are degrees of depravity, even within Fascism.
1023510904850276354 2018-07-29 10:09:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ShippeyGordon It affected different countries very differently, the differences being due to differences in their political cultures.
1023510291278168064 2018-07-29 10:07:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Guilt or shame, or rage or vengefulness, or just nihilism… But not in the case depicted, which was poignantly positive.  But Harold himself will likely not be 'with Harold' a decade or two hence. Ready for the next generation.
1023506314553708544 2018-07-29 09:51:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ShippeyGordon Not its political culture which was anomalously crude and already depraved by 1914, even as it excelled in other ways. 1929 not to blame.
1023501119169941504 2018-07-29 09:30:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RotemEren I'm with Harold.
1023499945314275328 2018-07-29 09:26:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I hope this isn't real. But it certainly refers to something real and foul in even the best, most advanced societies today.
1023479544769130496 2018-07-29 08:05:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @noise_random Depends what aspect interests you and where you're coming from. But maybe try Conjectures and Refutations.

1023214756126187521 2018-07-28 14:33:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @snoreydude By that criterion, any government voted out for having implemented bad policies would go straight to jail.
1023214132034715648 2018-07-28 14:30:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Aizazadi_ What about freedom-of-speech denial?
1023201471863484416 2018-07-28 13:40:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Soph8K BTW whether an utterance amounts to fraud/conspiracy/incitement depends on the cultural context.  So it's quite consistent that e.g waving a swastika flag constitutes incitement or conspiracy in some societies but not others. Same with relaying messages from the dead being fraud.
1023196476850221062 2018-07-28 13:20:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Soph8K "Forever beyond our species" sounds plausible and the contrary sounds arrogant and pulled out of a hat. But no! See The Beginning of Infinity Ch3.

1023192583894388737 2018-07-28 13:04:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @danielcincu If it amounts to fraud. But "climate change deniers" (appallingly vague term) are not accused of falsifying results but of making bad arguments.
1023190636529373184 2018-07-28 12:57:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Soph8K As for "Why is there something rather than nothing?" Someone once replied "Because if there were nothing you'd *still* be complaining."  More seriously: it's too vague to have an answer. A substantive problem has to have conflicting ideas, like "It seems that X, yet X can't be!"
1023189527681277952 2018-07-28 12:52:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Soph8K As for foundation - see e.g. Popper "Knowledge Without Authority".
1023188703265607681 2018-07-28 12:49:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Soph8K No opinion should be a crime except where it is integral to other crimes. E.g. fraud, conspiracy or incitement. Libel should be a civil matter.
1023175677883965440 2018-07-28 11:57:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Put the sperm-count-fearers in a room with the life-extension-fearers and only let them out when they've agreed what we should be fearing.
1023171723380891648 2018-07-28 11:42:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Soph8K No idea has foundation. And a small minority of scientists disagreeing with an overwhelming consensus is completely normal.
1023147077763833856 2018-07-28 10:04:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And general-relativity denial?
1023121529750671360 2018-07-28 08:22:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher Heh. There's no copyright for titles, though.

1022872469584138241 2018-07-27 15:52:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @newscientist The first one isn't even in English.
1022862502500200448 2018-07-27 15:13:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Its role in the incitement is usually ignored in the West because it runs counter to the preferred narratives legitimising those murders.
1022861558790201344 2018-07-27 15:09:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The Al-Aqsa libel is unusual in that it was invented as recently as 1922, and its source is known (the Grand Mufti). It has incited the murders of hundreds of Jews.
1022719779076026368 2018-07-27 05:46:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @chlodulfmaximi1 @dela3499 E.g. tenure for academics is a practice that won't survive life-extension technology. So what? Good riddance.  Replacing CEOs, party leaders et al. long before retirement age is common even today (in free societies).  This whole objection to staying alive seems a non-issue to me.

But often not. Much more often causes conspiracy theories, blood libels etc.  It's an irrational mode of thought about right and wrong. Not an emotion.
1022254188103917573 2018-07-25 22:56:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @monojohnny It's the millennia-old Pattern of legitimising hurting Jews. Often very confusingly called 'antisemitism'.

1022242105224294400 2018-07-25 22:08:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The fall of the Labour party to the Pattern is not an existential threat to Jewish life in Britain, but it is a tragedy for the party and the country.  https://t.co/assIp4QCbB

1022112536043446287 2018-07-25 13:33:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @pmathies Yes, they literally are comfortable saying “magic” but not parallel universes.
1022101031017168896 2018-07-25 12:47:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jlz0z In the case of the new GM regulation, that argument is addressed in the New Scientist article.  More generally, we'd have to double- or triple-check the precautionary principle (thus interpreted) before use, to make sure it never causes catastrophes. What would those tests show?
1022094778568245248 2018-07-25 12:22:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jlz0z The 'precautionary principle' is interpreted in diverse ways. At the more literal end of the scale, the most important thing it rules out is itself. See pp201-4 of The Beginning of Infinity.
1022087909774635008 2018-07-25 11:55:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "This is a backward step, not progress." Indeed. I hope that this will be one of the first backward steps that Parliament undoes when it is allowed to.  https://t.co/0pU2zKI9TX

1021811175082913793 2018-07-24 17:35:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @jpdowling …if the program also has to interact with other programs and deal in other units such as parsecs and furlongs, you may do better to make the change in two steps, first isolating all unit-dependent things in one place.

1021796717564489730 2018-07-24 16:38:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @jpdowling Also, as a practical matter, one should try small changes whenever feasible in order to manage the consequential changes and/or criticisms more easily.
1021795703515951104 2018-07-24 16:34:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @jpdowling I'd say so. Though since new conjectures are made by varying old ideas, no totally revolutionary change in ideas is possible.

1021734962800861185 2018-07-24 12:32:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @jpdowling Everyone wants there to be more scientific knowledge, more art and less suffering. And there are as many criteria and priorities among those things as there are people. So everyone who's able to make ends meet in their own lives *wants* to make the world better in those ways.
1021724499815878657 2018-07-24 11:51:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jpdowling This doesn't *prove* there's something badly wrong with science funding—but there is. There's a lack of diversity in criteria—and proliferation of irrelevant ones. Heavy bias toward incremental progress over fundamental. Ever more administration. Red tape. Institutionalism…
1021490306569646080 2018-07-23 20:20:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Not yet but it could happen. Substrate independence and interoperability seem to be deep. Information, heat, work aren't the only examples.
1021450918062149634 2018-07-23 17:44:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EricRWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg I guess we have different opinions about the effect of his *actions*—the Iran deal, the UNSC anti-Israel resolution. Also, reneging on obligations isn't really 'inaction'.
1021407561394909184 2018-07-23 14:51:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lmh1800 @EricRWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg 'Provocations of war' is unfair. Concealing the fact that there is a red line (as e.g. Britain did before the Falklands war) is also a provocation of war.  And neither is as bad as declaring one and then reneging.
1021406317511094273 2018-07-23 14:46:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lmh1800 @EricRWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg Both made it riskier to rely on US commitments, Obama by breaking them (Ukraine, Syrian rebels) and Trump by casting doubt on them (Nato, S. Korea).
1021396547517526016 2018-07-23 14:08:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EricRWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg That's right. But the status quo ante was also an existential risk, and for some of the same reasons.

1021346400351793152 2018-07-23 10:48:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @ToKTeacher It can have something to do with skill.
1021345029921681413 2018-07-23 10:43:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @ToKTeacher They do. Maybe people overestimate the efficiency of these systems, so we sometimes got fake surgeons/pilots or incompetent but qualified ones. But not often. Plane crashes are rare and getting rarer.
1021342058970312704 2018-07-23 10:31:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher @MatjazLeonardis Exactly. We don't have *trust* in a *person* to be an *expert*, we have an explanatory theory about the error-correcting abilities of a system.
1021298156942905345 2018-07-23 07:37:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Magnificent. The optimistic car.

1020748282321043456 2018-07-21 19:12:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MirabelleW18 Israel denies that the status quo—Jews daily being hurt (dispossessed, terrorised, injured, murdered) is a legitimate state of affairs.  Israel, in fact, *is* such a denial. Which is why it has become the principal focus of the Pattern.
1020734889811996672 2018-07-21 18:18:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I was watching all night on a 9" monochrome TV.

1020426666366074880 2018-07-20 21:54:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell They do feel bereaved. Which doesn't make sense because if their "life's work" was right, it's not dead: it will be resumed one day when Britain rejoins. And if it was wrong and dead, well, no one is an oracle: they did they honest best. (Until recently…)
1020363907607744512 2018-07-20 17:44:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Yes. Constructor theory consists of principles of that kind. And some of the principles of relativity are already in constructor-theoretic form. But we haven't translated the others yet. Constructor theory of time must come first.

But they are universal, so that tells us nothing about what they are used for now, nor about the comparative difficulty of various uses today.

The main blemish is proportional representation, which gives disproportionate power to minorities.
1020248485763911680 2018-07-20 10:06:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis It takes both. But explanations have often played an essential role. E.g. in the decline of corporal punishment of children. And the abolition and stigmatisation of slavery: Wedgwood's "Am I not a man and a brother?" was an *argument*.
1020247129426718721 2018-07-20 10:00:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis To free children from being forced into hard labour takes inventing and making tractors AND persuading people of a lifestyle where children don't have to do hard labour. To free children from compulsory boring lessons you only have to do the analogue of the latter. Hence: easier.

1020053091352305669 2018-07-19 21:09:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @commonomics That could go either way on all interpretations. One has to use explanations, such as that weapons are useless at deterring aggression against an alliance if an aggressor can pick his time and gamble that the stronger members will betray the weaker ones.
1020006764585062400 2018-07-19 18:05:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BretWeinstein @SamHarrisOrg Right. Also there's a deep 'principle of natural justice': *Audi alteram partem" — Give a hearing to the other side.  If you can't state your opponents' argument in a form they would endorse, what exactly are you opposing?

It's the further arguments about *explanatory* universality, in The Beginning of Infinity, that make it implausible that there are constraints *on our ideas* other than via speed or memory capacity.
1019855054529089537 2018-07-19 08:02:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis I hope so. But the actual result was vastly more fun than the result he was expecting.

1016005855198793730 2018-07-08 17:07:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adilzeshan @clairlemon Well, not 'has to be': that's just one explanation consistent with the observations.  An interesting special case of it is if the treatment meted out to an inborn-fearless child would, with suitable reliability, turn *anyone* bad.
1015959287028441093 2018-07-08 14:02:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JamieCassidy7 @devonzuegel Well, if I thought I had a model that predicted asset price returns, I wouldn't be revealing it here, would I?  Whoops, that's the same model again. My bad.

Both warnings issued by the same person.
1015917826601816064 2018-07-08 11:17:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KittJohnson_ @Dam_Nuwen @webdevMason @MatjazLeonardis An inborn tendency to obey? Seems implausible, but if so, that's all the more reason to start those disobedience lessons ASAP!
1015915985310765056 2018-07-08 11:10:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KittJohnson_ @Dam_Nuwen @webdevMason @MatjazLeonardis I think it's basically 2. If 1 or 3, they were inculcated by previous experience of 2. We are not born anti-rational.

1015855612243120128 2018-07-08 07:10:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @MatjazLeonardis That whole mess is best avoided. Parents, on the other hand, have a choice whether to issue commands or not. The right choice is: not.
1015850102164983808 2018-07-08 06:48:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @MatjazLeonardis Don't get it. Which system?
1015839092997787648 2018-07-08 06:04:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @webdevMason Which is worse, being told by an authority that you are possessed by the arch-demon Beelzebub or by the arch-demon Beelphegor?

If someone *knows* that that's so in a particular case, they can cause the better thing to happen and be rewarded. If no one knows, then it's best that whoever has created whatever knowledge does exist, takes the risk, voluntarily, without being demonised for doing do.
1015623126770704384 2018-07-07 15:46:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion @MatjazLeonardis @devonzuegel You mean, they lose money on average? If not, large numbers of "the vast majority of people" could club together to make the same profit with arbitrarily low risk. They don't, because you can't create the requisite knowledge that way.

1015613664571936768 2018-07-07 15:09:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion @MatjazLeonardis @devonzuegel Rent seeking behaviour doesn't mean changing rent. Nor does it mean making a profit.  https://t.co/AtXspNfPbK
1015604022206763008 2018-07-07 14:30:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @devonzuegel Of course. The buyer is risking his savings for the benefit of the community, preserving the land for the future uses they will have for it, better than any that anyone can think of now. If he's right, everyone benefits. If not, he pays the whole price of being wrong.
1015595146602319872 2018-07-07 13:55:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @devonzuegel If the story is true then there must be buyers alive today, e.g. those wanting to use the land for something before selling it.  If it's a risky investment then the story is even more plainly false: the buyer is being paid for taking on the seller's risk.
1015583160128671744 2018-07-07 13:07:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @devonzuegel If this were true, everyone would buy a $3600 lot—or whatever share they can afford. Soon they would cost $6000 less interest. So it isn't true.
1015334744890970112 2018-07-06 20:40:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell Incremental is the best kind. I wonder if the EU Commission will agree to it.
1015317820287209476 2018-07-06 19:33:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @realTomHa It's quite nice.  https://t.co/jGst9RLnR8 But either way, we need the ability to control the large-scale climate.
1015306038852104193 2018-07-06 18:46:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> We need more such ideas and more such research.  https://t.co/xiAc6WPzUI

1015270189804474368 2018-07-06 16:24:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Actually we don't have to test children, but the rest is true enough. @PhilipPullman  https://t.co/a7ue9BWY1w
1015136906940702720 2018-07-06 07:34:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Perhaps one German minister daring to state the obvious is not 'EU unity cracking'. But why hasn't the British government done so?  https://t.co/nB7sIoc1ja
1015128545130147847 2018-07-06 07:01:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Somehow infinitesimals don't get the same adulation as infinities. Isn't that unfair?  BTW they do here  https://t.co/qxOF47lM4s which is fun.
1015115512207028224 2018-07-06 06:09:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Infinity is often used as an excuse for mysticism because of its undeserved reputation for incomprehensibility.  We often approximate something finite as infinite because it is *easier* to understand that way.
1014906345206710272 2018-07-05 16:18:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PelikanNutz1 @clairlemon The original point was a nonsequitur. The 'thought experiment' was a counter-example to its logic. (By showing that it made a hidden assumption not tested by the experiment.)
1014894287304175621 2018-07-05 15:30:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf>  https://t.co/bdMalN8Fze Good. But they'll be back.
1014802913821188097 2018-07-05 09:27:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @clairlemon Now imagine a *hypothetical* society so depraved that it instilled dispositions to behave morally largely by frightening children, and couldn't conceive of any other way. In that society, fearless people would be classified as a having an inborn predisposition to be bad, right?
1014788674045784064 2018-07-05 08:30:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @clairlemon So, since 'bad' in this context is 'fearless' plus something, 'some are born fearless' does not imply 'some are born bad' unless the 'something' is also inborn. Right?
1014786417074073600 2018-07-05 08:21:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @clairlemon Fearlessness in itself is neither a crime nor a moral failing. So – being 'bad' in this context is being 'fearless' plus … what?
1014634232621228034 2018-07-04 22:17:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @chesterapple1 @patrickwal "Lack of imagination" is a bit harsh. It's unimaginable. People in 1018 would have had scant chance of imagining us.  (BTW the fact that people in the year 18 could have made a fair job of imagining 1018 is a token of an unimaginably great tragedy.)
1014526932963201024 2018-07-04 15:10:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BriVandenAkker If the statement's meant to be 'only if', I don't think it's true. Why it's unreasonable to expect a bound, is discussed in The Beginning of Infinity. BTW we're not supposed to think any assumption safe, right? Least of all in regard to future knowledge.

1014124491847413760 2018-07-03 12:31:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @patrickwal I guess: the political right has always been attracted by the idea that society is in danger/decline, thus justifying authoritarianism. Historically the left was utopian and hence optimistic. Today's left isn't. It just can't stand the idea that anything's good about our society.
1014121355237822464 2018-07-03 12:19:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @patrickwal Most can't remember 50 years ago, so can't feel worse. They feel THAT things are worse. Not sure there's a single reason.
1014114769035505664 2018-07-03 11:52:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Wow. Well, at least that particular extreme delusion wasn't as common 50 years ago.  https://t.co/YQwsrYcGO1

Illiberal polities; cultures/subcultures of violence; coercive educational traditions; romantic (e.g. nationalism, socialism) political traditions, and religious ones; employer-employee relatonship…
1013731180070559744 2018-07-02 10:28:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis We started to stop in 1688 or so. Or maybe 1469. We have quite a way to go, but the greatest challenges have been overcome.

1013712091507757056 2018-07-02 09:12:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Ah, so *that's* why he said 'queue' instead of 'line' when referring to that non-existent entity. I did wonder at the time.  https://t.co/PsshnadqE6

But Popper's, for instance, rejects both psychological and probabilistic theories of knowledge. Knowledge is conjectural. Can be objectively true (contain truth), but neither certain nor probable.
1013677256223477760 2018-07-02 06:54:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> OK I'm convinced that this is more than just an analogy.  https://t.co/VZMLwT4FJT

1013352729098571777 2018-07-01 09:24:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher @jordanbpeterson It's understandable, and even to his credit, that he never answered the question but openly mused about it.  I think the answer is: "No, psychological science can't help *us* decide, but inexplicit knowledge I've gained as a psychologist can help *me*."

1013045766691196928 2018-06-30 13:05:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @reasonisfun Presumably there is (humans can interpret almost anything as almost anything else) but that's not relevant because death will eventually be cured.

1013027050851131392 2018-06-30 11:50:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @reasonisfun Surely there are individuals who have run out of it. In which case, why couldn't everyone, eventually?

1012609257857011712 2018-06-29 08:10:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RotemEren Maybe. Also, Popper had already made considerable progress in philosophy when he was thinking in German. So go figure.  But I don't think the three you mention made much. Gödel arguably. Einstein, no. Wittgenstein, a negative amount.

1012591599325499392 2018-06-29 07:00:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Chicken-and-egg, perhaps. It's interesting that as soon as Popper learned English he made a decision never to do philosophy in German again.  https://t.co/cVhu6ug0LM
1012589680561410049 2018-06-29 06:52:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ProfBrianCox The construction referred to, and the enormous effort and engagement it required, began long before Britain's EU membership and will continue after it.

1012412951662342144 2018-06-28 19:10:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> In fact he was joking – and about something else at that. The report is grotesquely wrong.  https://t.co/0JmsfnXC2K
1012412284990259200 2018-06-28 19:07:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BDSixsmith Yes he was joking – and about something else at that. The report is grotesquely wrong.
1012408457364951040 2018-06-28 18:52:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BillyBocksfuss Yes. But it might be tl;dr

1012345526212325376 2018-06-28 14:42:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. And so in addition to reducing CO2 emissions, they increase the reflectivity of the Earth.  https://t.co/hAbMJcl5LG

1011533125439098880 2018-06-26 08:54:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @GaKePe If false, they are errors. Error is inevitable but any particular error is correctable.
1011532482410438656 2018-06-26 08:51:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Marcusdstewart @nntaleb Hard to evaluate the counterfactual but the mechanisms proposed for how they might have, seem implausible. Plausibly they might have hindered.

1011321019087441922 2018-06-25 18:51:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MickleStreet Gödel's theorem is about infinite, discrete sets, or physically, asymptotic behaviour, and so is not directly relevant to physics.

1010497879042084866 2018-06-23 12:20:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Crit_Rat Not the first. It is inevitable and may contain useful truth.
1010494258556620800 2018-06-23 12:06:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Prejudice in hiring: You expect individuals of certain groups to lack the required ability.  Bias: You require more convincing from members of some groups than others.  Bigotry: You refuse to be convinced. Or, even if convinced, you hire someone else.
1010416746627522561 2018-06-23 06:58:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DegenRolf @clairlemon Or at least, that's what everyone believes.
1010409629501837313 2018-06-23 06:30:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SDUPRE Nothing special. For photons in lasers, yes. For the multiverse, no—many know the math but don't think of it that way, or at all.
1010294027403571200 2018-06-22 22:50:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SDUPRE It's accurate. And applies to fungible entities within a universe too, e.g. photons in a laser.
1010285334507212800 2018-06-22 22:16:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SDUPRE No. Change the contents of the location via one pointer, you change it for all the others. Fungible entities really are multiple.

What would you do to save Michelle, your belle, when you only know one sentence of French and it isn't stove-related?  And whatever that is, if she assumed it was just you trying to be mean to her and started to fight you—the problem began earlier.
1009790755462963201 2018-06-21 13:30:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TheCrookedMan No that would still be your fault.

Not everything I do is something you "let" me do: I'm a person with agency and rights. Not everything I change my mind about is a case of me being thwarted: I can think, and take advice—even from a foreigner when we have no common language.
1009785516533968896 2018-06-21 13:10:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TheCrookedMan It wasn't true when there were hot stoves, or hot camp fires either. It was just culture then, as now.
1009780080086863872 2018-06-21 12:48:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TheCrookedMan I'm old enough to remember that being used as an argument for smacking toddlers. By someone who was old enough to remember stoves being hot to the touch. Ah, how culture persists!
1009769914792595461 2018-06-21 12:08:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Not to worry: since the Irreconcilable-Remain faction will classify anything whatever that happens as 'failing hard', there is scope for an outcome that pleases everyone.  https://t.co/6mpgrrYCWq

1009723270906736641 2018-06-21 09:02:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @zarzuelazen It's just that 'many worlds' is a somewhat misleading term for the multiverse.   Still, in a quantum computer, 'worlds' can be independent for a long time and then rejoin in a single branch containing evidence of all of them.

1009395353597116416 2018-06-20 11:19:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JCMaas But there's a but. We must ensure that it does indeed have the effect of creating more. 'Multiculturalism' strongly counteracts that.
1009395012940062720 2018-06-20 11:18:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @JCMaas Yes. *Even* worse.  I favour greatly increased immigration to the US and UK. Britons and Americans are a good thing, so let's create more.
1009180234921455621 2018-06-19 21:04:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher @dela3499 It grows in the specious soil of Bayesian epistemology, which achieved near-complete cultural capture first.

1008964362852290561 2018-06-19 06:47:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @sarkisz Can't be gradual if it can't be unilateral. The point of gradual is to put error-correction in the hands of the British political system.  Cf. when France partially left NATO in 1959 &amp; 1966. It could be unilateral because NATO membership doesn't involve 'pooled sovereignty'.
1008833196488839170 2018-06-18 22:05:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sarkisz Unfortunately Britain was bound by a treaty that does not allow for unilateral gradual withdrawal. The revolutionary act was to join it.
1008754523182125057 2018-06-18 16:53:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EvanOLeary The first system commands the resulting behaviours. In the second, the behaviours are unpredictable, as required for progress.
1008748387745886208 2018-06-18 16:28:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EvanOLeary They are key attributes of two different classes of political traditions.
1008747854125510661 2018-06-18 16:26:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tvetera @Wilhelm_Treffer Not even that. Possibly, eg, an inherited behaviour, functionally unrelated or even opposed to having suitable interests, which then reliably induces treatment that then causes such interests.

1008643379788382208 2018-06-18 09:31:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @realTomHa No that's an opposing idea.
1008638846278537216 2018-06-18 09:13:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The rational alternative: Everything is permitted unless explicitly forbidden by law enacted legitimately under error-correcting institutions.

1008441921121980423 2018-06-17 20:11:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Could it be that courses are just inherently too fast and too focused on coverage rather than exploration?

1008424821707956224 2018-06-17 19:03:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Can you recommend one that would convince me? I'm sceptical but I could try it on a thing I've been trying to understand that's a little apart from things I'm expert in.
1008421004329308161 2018-06-17 18:47:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @Make3333 @michael_nielsen Yes! That nicely characterises the difference between memorising and understanding.

1008419626966048768 2018-06-17 18:42:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen OK good point. Still, I don't think that's the generic case. And even with chess, you get to recognise configurations if you love analysing games.
1008413622643707904 2018-06-17 18:18:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Make3333 @michael_nielsen It's more important that paper (or computers) and humans have different purposes. The former's is to memorise, the latter's to understand.
1008405785502736384 2018-06-17 17:47:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michael_nielsen Are books for memorising things? Aren't they already far better at that than their readers?  Each (good) book has a purpose that isn't memorisation, and for each purpose there is a right length.
1008403006478577665 2018-06-17 17:36:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @elonmusk @michaelshermer That's not democracy. Just a who-should-rule formula. See  https://t.co/Y5lDYcgkW9
1008314945077997569 2018-06-17 11:46:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EduardoLuft That's true, but his video imagines that it may not be true in the future. My point is: even if it isn't, using power per se causes inefficiency. Eg because it diverts people's creativity into hurting each other and defending themselves from hurt, and away from useful problems.
1008252082212757504 2018-06-17 07:36:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EduardoLuft That wouldn't help. Power is not efficient at creating knowledge.
1008093131185770500 2018-06-16 21:05:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Phillips_M_G I'm not familiar with it.
1008092819494498304 2018-06-16 21:03:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TheAnnaGat I was denying that the government do those things *efficiently*, because if it could,  it could do even better by trading instead.
1008070860303949824 2018-06-16 19:36:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If the government ever became that knowledgable and efficient, an even more efficient thing it could do would be to forget about all that stealthy algorithmic hypnosis stuff, and become an ordinary entrepreneur. If that seems implausible, the feared scenario must be even more so.  https://t.co/hn6iucNXRq
1007758372500836352 2018-06-15 22:54:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @webdevMason I think it's just the Popperian thing that all rational thought is conjecture and/or criticism. There's no such thing as positive argument.
1007733631199084544 2018-06-15 21:16:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis So—how many variables does one typically have to look at in a sample taken from any population, in order to find a startling publishable result?
1007496573004275712 2018-06-15 05:34:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @webdevMason @kareem_sabri The two phenomena aren't separate. Like "if you're going to do X, you'd better do it properly—take courses in it—get qualified—or you'll never etc"
1007483195875610624 2018-06-15 04:41:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LahavHarkov And that the US is British?

1007239457207193600 2018-06-14 12:32:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @tofara_moyo @examachine No.
1007239241250885632 2018-06-14 12:32:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jonesxxx Assuming that the same sort of thing doesn't happen to emissions control actions is the mistake I mentioned.
1007178457028194304 2018-06-14 08:30:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @giggs_boson @taketheco2out AFAIK, there is no prevailing theory of what the optimum long-run level is. We shall know one day, and we need to have tools to adjust it.
1007176537404329984 2018-06-14 08:22:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jonesxxx @taketheco2out It's a mistake to single out one geoengineering method—emissions control—as infallible, not human or not social. And reliance on it as magically safe.
1007170607241457665 2018-06-14 07:59:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BlackwoodNC @ToKTeacher @reasonisfun Classification doesn't matter and there's no such thing as subjects, only problems and theories.  IMO both those schools are philosophical frameworks within which theories can be formulated. Trying out those theories is more market research than crucial testing. Never decisive.
1007168763425325057 2018-06-14 07:52:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @fieryfalliblist Depends very much on where you're coming from. His intellectual autobiography Unended Quest explains most where *he* was coming from.
1007016518301908992 2018-06-13 21:47:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TomasUtting @taketheco2out Research and small-scale trials are needed on many more ideas. We can expect to reject most, especially in their initial, naive versions.
1007011576531111938 2018-06-13 21:27:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I've often said that geo-engineering to address climate change needs dozens of schemes in parallel. Well, apparently there are several ideas about algae alone @taketheco2out
1007008289090043909 2018-06-13 21:14:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @ToKTeacher @david_hurn @Hugoisms And perhaps, how the proponents of that theory would defend it against a flat-moon variant.
1006972402339930118 2018-06-13 18:51:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @webdevMason @seculartaoist @kareem_sabri It's a problem.
1006972188736524288 2018-06-13 18:50:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @MatjazLeonardis @seculartaoist @kareem_sabri Yes. Better to find a way to enjoy the commute – or any one of countless ideas that avoid being tied down.  Also: a job that's an 8-hour unmitigated *loss* every day is…a problem. Addressing it should be high on the agenda.
1006860568714674176 2018-06-13 11:27:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Many institutions are now engaged in sharply reducing the diversity of ideas they deal in. The fad for so-called-diversity is one of the culprits.  https://t.co/IxHyYVfOBX
1006849104725598210 2018-06-13 10:41:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason @MatjazLeonardis @kareem_sabri In reality "all life is problem-solving" (Popper). In reality, Waste of time=When you don't love the problem.  In current practice, when you're young, people are continually wasting your time. This can lead to internalising ideas like "OK as a hobby" with dire results as you say.
1006648258117160960 2018-06-12 21:23:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @DouglasKMurray But they would frame those facts differently in their own minds.
1006647765517176832 2018-06-12 21:21:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @newscientist No it doesn't.
1006498765975490562 2018-06-12 11:29:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MirabelleW18 Anything that gets (morally) bad enough, joins up with the Pattern.
1006314462838706176 2018-06-11 23:17:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasKMurray I recall a Bernard Levin column maybe called Does He Know? About Ceaușescu's multi-volume leather bound book. (Does he know he's sitting on top of a dungheap?) No.
1006123378363813888 2018-06-11 10:38:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MaajidNawaz telling it like it is. By the way, the symbol on the Israeli flag is not just one of identity: it is a shield.  https://t.co/AWUEVjDUcJ
1006108696827564032 2018-06-11 09:39:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion @webdevMason Yes, but it's only an intuition pump, not an exact analogy. Spouses should indeed have an equal relationship, but parents have far more obligations to their children than vice-versa, or to each other.
1006089509862244353 2018-06-11 08:23:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion @webdevMason Sort of. But that's again a backwards way of putting it. Here's an intuition pump: Think what you'd guess a husband is really doing, if he says that very thing about his wife.
1006088122617221120 2018-06-11 08:17:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion @webdevMason The explanation is, of course: it's the adults who are thinking and behaving irrationally and immorally.
1006087074603204608 2018-06-11 08:13:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion @webdevMason If they get their way, what's the point of violence &amp; anger? But they don't, do they? So I want a deeper explanation: why is someone in a situation where they seemingly want something impossible, and futilely hurt themselves when they don't get it? This can't have evolved, right?
1006078124159840256 2018-06-11 07:38:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion @webdevMason And, yes they are.
1006065765928308736 2018-06-11 06:49:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Commands like "grow up" typically mean: 'conform to anti-rational memes' (see The Beginning of Infinity).  Other times, adults are accusing other adults of being children, as a form of un-argued insult.
1005941806872264704 2018-06-10 22:36:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey Whoops, I followed your theme and made them *threat/non-threat* rather than *advocacy/non-advocacy*. But that would do almost as well.
1005936661166022656 2018-06-10 22:16:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine @DKedmey @topkara @luscombe_alex So, which was which?
1005935484013563904 2018-06-10 22:11:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @topkara @examachine @luscombe_alex And if so, that means: (1) they are sure which is which though I haven't told them. And (2) they think the training set doesn't yet cover those.
1005935101979525122 2018-06-10 22:09:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @topkara @examachine @luscombe_alex Of course those are useless now, because they'll just put them in the training set.
1005934706108530689 2018-06-10 22:08:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @topkara @examachine @luscombe_alex 1 Give me your wallet and I'll fix it for you. 2 Give me your wallet and I'll let you live.
1005933404901335042 2018-06-10 22:03:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @topkara @examachine @luscombe_alex Too ambiguous. Not allowed.
1005857686989213699 2018-06-10 17:02:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PhelanLmphelan @clairlemon They need ability to do the job. Degree 'not needed' doesn't mean 'forbidden'. It is one of countless ways of providing evidence of competence. At best, though, it's only moderately relevant evidence. For most jobs, including in publishing, it's virtually unrelated to competence.
1005773519920119808 2018-06-10 11:27:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EdSzumowski @clairlemon If it isn't, that will open the opportunities that @clairlemon noted.
1005750397531836418 2018-06-10 09:55:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ThomasFriedman_ @Emmyjewel Yes.
1005711241447464960 2018-06-10 07:20:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ajventer @SamHarrisOrg Marxism is several things, some of them mutually inconsistent. So it is indeed possible to be a Marxist and a postmodernist, as much as it is possible to be a Marxist at all. The same holds for postmodernism, which is a grand bunch of narratives for un-explaining everything.
1005709889677774848 2018-06-10 07:14:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AltergottEric @SamHarrisOrg I was arguing that the origin of ideas is irrelevant to evaluating them, by highlighting the inconsistency of a prevalent ideology that denies this.
1005680770369949696 2018-06-10 05:19:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @clairlemon Yes, but the 'no need for a degree' policy goes in the opposite direction to the others: it means hire on merit, not by mechanical criteria.
1005564680021139456 2018-06-09 21:37:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @thefinchster22 @SamHarrisOrg No. Being opposed to a particular colonisation is different to being opposed to colonialism on principle. The latter is a Western idea.
1005563370890842116 2018-06-09 21:32:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TheRealTroff @SamHarrisOrg Why hedge?
1005561773267746816 2018-06-09 21:26:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @examachine @luscombe_alex You've posted one. So have others. Those are indeed the kinds I meant, though I'd want to make them more straightforward.
1005513724218806273 2018-06-09 18:15:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Quietly powerful.  https://t.co/Zi5Nm5l3D4
1005437427937435649 2018-06-09 13:12:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine @luscombe_alex Again: I can find people who can perform this simple task perfectly. The challenge is to write a program that can. It is not to trawl through 10,000 humans in the hope of finding one who can't.
1005434327688269825 2018-06-09 12:59:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TedsTheory @jamessseattle @ToKTeacher We happen to call two different things 'fear' because they are physiologically similar.. They can come in combination—but need not.
1005430712986750976 2018-06-09 12:45:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine @luscombe_alex No, wrong. The idea that anything that can be done 100% reliably can be done by a mindless program is the very idea I'm contradicting.  It is why I called this a *preliminary* challenge and am prepared to bet that the AI community has no idea how to meet even that.
1005426221994430464 2018-06-09 12:27:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine @luscombe_alex Again: I can easily find humans who can perform the specified task with 100% accuracy. Therefore it is not "inherently ambiguous".
1005417372545667072 2018-06-09 11:52:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TedsTheory @jamessseattle @ToKTeacher Nothing unpleasant is essential to creativity, human thriving, or progress. If it were, that would be "a boot stamping on a human face—for ever".  I.e. it would be an insoluble problem in the sense I argued in The Beginning of Infinity can't exist.
1005387293602013184 2018-06-09 09:53:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If this really happened as reported, it requires a genuine apology, including an explicit withdrawal of the threat, and a statement of what will be done to ensure that it never happens again.  https://t.co/8iqUPUrw7e
1005361993434435584 2018-06-09 08:12:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> She was not a suffragette. She was a suffragist: a lawful campaigner for women's right to vote.  https://t.co/PpFk3hpxl0
1005360558089080832 2018-06-09 08:06:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> By the way, Marxism, postmodernism, anti-colonialism and progressivism are all Western ideas. Should they be taboo too?  https://t.co/IgCZzvmb8m
1005352986221207553 2018-06-09 07:36:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Redux015 I think that confuses impeachment and criminal law. The latter is not a mechanism for removing leaders, nor is it a peaceful one.
1005195165101903872 2018-06-08 21:09:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I was interviewed about AGI and other things by the CBC Radio programme Tapestry whose theme is "What it means to be human".  https://t.co/k7QTnBYC8x
1004833994033201153 2018-06-07 21:14:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jfitzsimons No, that would not be certified as unambiguous by any reasonable panel. Nor would they all give the same answer.
1004746222182322176 2018-06-07 15:25:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine @ylecun Again, it is realistic, since under the stated conditions, I myself must have guessed what the panel will say, with 100% accuracy.
1004745238584446980 2018-06-07 15:21:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine Just add the random law students to the panel.
1004732851215110145 2018-06-07 14:32:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine Again: I prepare a set for which a panel of humans HAS got 100%. We can make the panel such that I choose half of them and you choose half..
1004729361726169088 2018-06-07 14:18:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine The test texts will be such that the human judges will all score 100% and also agree unanimously they they are unambiguous. The is a condition that makes it as *easy* as possible for the program (or anyone) to score 100%. And I'm betting they still can't.
1004704215502073856 2018-06-07 12:38:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine Yes I prepare my texts without seeing the program, which you write without seeing my texts. I'm only allowed to give it texts that human judges (I suggested lawyers but YMMV) score 100% at distinguishing those advocating crime from those not. You win if your program does that.
1004693087900270592 2018-06-07 11:54:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine "Defeat" = "Write texts that it will mis-classify".
1004666039156793344 2018-06-07 10:07:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine @luscombe_alex Something certified in advance as unambiguous is inherently ambiguous?
1004660217198628864 2018-06-07 09:43:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @luscombe_alex @examachine Without false positives or negatives for texts that a panel of lawyers certifies in advance as unambiguously advocating or not advocating crime.
1004656794118033409 2018-06-07 09:30:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist @faisalislam But it's the identical question to what it is like to be a Remain voter in his/her most introspective moments.
1004654404044230656 2018-06-07 09:20:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @examachine Likely? I hereby offer £10,000 to the first person who can write such a classifier that I can't defeat, by the end of the year.

1004648298295197696 2018-06-07 08:56:34 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MartinMillnert Even if the challenge is understood as being relative to a given legal system, etc, the underlying issue remains
1004643484786184192 2018-06-07 08:37:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist @faisalislam Admit? See The Beginning of Infinity pp64-5.
1004641735883083776 2018-06-07 08:30:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DutchHester Yeah, Asimov's Robot stories included the misconception I'm referring to. But still great! Computers were a very recent innovation then.
1004635842562969600 2018-06-07 08:07:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Preliminary challenge for AGI researchers: design a word processor that works fine except that it can't produce documents advocating crime.
1004458429832982528 2018-06-06 20:22:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adilzeshan @dave_billingham I mean when someone says contradictory things in the full glare of massive publicity, then after very few times no one can reasonably assume he means anything literally. Would be like assuming that van Gogh was aiming for photorealism.
1004418760424423424 2018-06-06 17:44:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dave_billingham That became insignificant after the first two or three occasions when he said contradictory things.
1004402020084801536 2018-06-06 16:37:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The worst thing that President Trump has done so far is to increase the already-absurd amount of hyperbole in political discourse to the level of completely unrestrained automatism.  https://t.co/OmPgLKOU8c
1004234135358132224 2018-06-06 05:30:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist @faisalislam Originally (prior to the referendum), yes. But it's getting very stale now as it's crying wolf rather uncreatively.  All these stories are prophecies dependent on the assumption that no one in Britain is ever going to solve problems again.
1004063877028433921 2018-06-05 18:14:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich Is there also an Equal Protection issue? Can there be an un-pardonable citizen when everyone else is entitled to petition and be considered for a pardon?
1003998651939606529 2018-06-05 13:55:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Sam_Dumitriu Yes, but give him credit: he did not want to destroy or sabotage the institutions that would then have removed him from power. (And indeed, did.)
1003993208416686083 2018-06-05 13:33:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "You've been had" is a hard propositions to take seriously. That's partly because it's misunderstood to mean "you've been fooled…you're a fool…"
1003711587788754945 2018-06-04 18:54:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MBuell01 @missmayim @Everytown I see. Thanks. Seems to me the policy of restricting law-abiding people's rights in order to minimise murders (or accidents) is morally very different from doing it to minimise suicide. The two are unconnected and should be discussed separately.
1003588562607067138 2018-06-04 10:45:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ColinEdwardLang Tough call. I guess not. They were already very homogeneous politically. Even so, the unification cost them a civil war and 670,000 lives.  Supplementary question: would it have been even better if Canada had joined? And Mexico? Or if the US had never declared independence?
1003585384297705473 2018-06-04 10:32:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Another: The idea of Political Union was so ludicrous that I thought it couldn't possibly be anyone's policy. British newspapers and TV presented the idea as scaremongering. No internet. It would've taken hard work to find out it was the raison d'être of the whole project.
1003583725635022849 2018-06-04 10:26:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Good question. One reason: I disagreed with him on almost everything. Another: I accepted government assurances. Both are bad reasons.
1003518041169293312 2018-06-04 06:05:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> At the time I thought he was making a fuss about nothing. But it turns out he was right about this and I was dead wrong.  https://t.co/HFR7xkSjfi
1003391986731241472 2018-06-03 21:44:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DutchHester Appreciated.
1003386561441001477 2018-06-03 21:22:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Quite so. BTW, human-rights violators, termites and Satan are all things that it's legitimate to hurt. That's what this is about: fabricating that legitimacy out of whole cloth.  https://t.co/GnARJGdjdl

1003260009785053184 2018-06-03 13:00:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @timothycbates @TaniaArline @FSNole57 If a treatment T is such that a behaviour B would result if and only if T is applied, regardless of what gene variants are present, then T 100% causes B.  But yes, this fact is systematically concealed by the terminology used in the field.
1003240646990352384 2018-06-03 11:43:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @timothycbates @TaniaArline @FSNole57 All it would take is for gene variants that reliably cause criminal behaviours in some cultures, not to cause them at all in others. Doesn't need intuitions about zygosity.

1003223796399202304 2018-06-03 10:36:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TaniaArline @FSNole57 Special meanings of "influence" and "account for" conceal the fact that this result is consistent with criminal behaviour being 100% caused by how people are treated.

1002947963126190082 2018-06-02 16:20:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @xan_desanctis @MirabelleW18 Say you can input a DNA sequence into a device that then makes a baby with that DNA. Knowingly using DNA containing genes for disabilities is immoral.

We, they, and all our other cousin species were deeply in thrall to anti-rational memes at the time, with almost no means of solving new problems. Our species alone survived, by sheer luck.
1002596328160026624 2018-06-01 17:02:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @specialcat0 Yes, and yes.
1002508868319137793 2018-06-01 11:15:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reasonisfun @mikeficus All very true. Also, the history of ideas is itself interesting.
1002508342630199296 2018-06-01 11:13:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jlahnsteiner @reasonisfun Come to think of it, that's not true. As a grad student I had to cite the Minakshisundaram–Pleijel–DeWitt function and thought it cool.

1002501533592969216 2018-06-01 10:46:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jlahnsteiner @reasonisfun Yes but if a historian of ideas discovered that those equations were first discovered by Floßhilde Schinkenfleckerl, I wouldn't thank him.
1002477985998557184 2018-06-01 09:12:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reasonisfun Absolutely always.

1002476338710765568 2018-06-01 09:05:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reasonisfun Why attribute this to its author, then?
1002475144235929600 2018-06-01 09:01:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @specialcat0 Threats to commit crimes, yes. The others are civil offences, which require proof of actual harm, and for which the remedy should be forced restitution, not punishment.

1002438468486692864 2018-06-01 06:35:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @OliverKamm with a similar thought:  https://t.co/2g7DjCRyKP  But I suspect he doesn't get that Holocaust denial *can* sometimes amount to incitement to violence.
1002297653709955072 2018-05-31 21:15:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Applies to one person or to any number interacting rationally.
1002277108058640384 2018-05-31 19:54:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Rational thought consists of conjecture and criticism and nothing else. Talk of 'argument for' something is shorthand for shooting down opponents of a conjecture.
1002238171625684993 2018-05-31 17:19:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This new legal interpretation should be reined in by legislation  https://t.co/w1jdtHUGJE Holocaust denial *can* amount to incitement to violence—but rarely. It's wrong to ban speech that isn't incitement. Yes shun, contradict, ridicule—but it's impossible to silence *only* evil.

1002196200597180416 2018-05-31 14:32:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DarcyHensel Good catch. Even if it contained cement, it is apparently not an "UNRWA cement sack"! Nevertheless someone repurposed the cement as well as the sacks.

1002189388766466049 2018-05-31 14:05:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @andrew_lilico @HumanProgress 😀 Yes that's what the exceptional cases are like. That's why I hedged with "overwhelmingly" &amp; "virtually". Virtually none of history is of that type.
1002186592856010753 2018-05-31 13:54:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @andrew_lilico @HumanProgress Basic needs are never new. The practical context, if new, is virtually always caused by ideas.  For instance, for decades people saw overpopulation as our paramount practical context. But that's just an idea, and false. Genuine practicalities likewise only reach us through ideas.
1002182165667504128 2018-05-31 13:37:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @andrew_lilico @HumanProgress New "needs" aren't needs until after someone thinks they should be met. New situations are overwhelmingly created by new ideas.
1002180008306266113 2018-05-31 13:28:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HumanProgress All history is the history of ideas. Ideas cause history, not vice-versa.

1001937064433213440 2018-05-30 21:23:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RJsnda @RichardDawkins The usual: it's extremely hard to vary. And the few known defects in the original version (e.g. continuous traits) have been fixed.
1001907520942825472 2018-05-30 19:25:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @intelligent50 @RichardDawkins @rdfrs It's called the Standard Gravitational Parameter of an object.  https://t.co/8Akt3TdOEu But the point is, it can be measured accurately.
1001838437002043392 2018-05-30 14:51:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @intelligent50 @RichardDawkins @rdfrs If quantities X, Y and Z are related by X=YZ, and X can be measured accurately but Y and Z only inaccurately, then the accurately known value of X doesn't help with improving the accuracy with which Y or Z are known.

1001824286888296448 2018-05-30 13:54:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @intelligent50 @RichardDawkins @rdfrs No, both are known to four significant figures, while their product is known much more accurately.
1001823515178360832 2018-05-30 13:51:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @intelligent50 @RichardDawkins @rdfrs Both.
1001820135286550528 2018-05-30 13:38:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @intelligent50 @RichardDawkins @rdfrs The reason is that G appears, under the predictions of both theories, in the form GM where M is the mass of the gravitating body in question. For many large bodies, GM is known with great accuracy while G is only known to four significant figures.
1001816504151748609 2018-05-30 13:24:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BensRoad @MacaesBruno Yes that's the better of those two options—but they're not the only ones. E.g. one need not condone Trump's hyperbole nor his opponents'.
1001810448239546368 2018-05-30 12:59:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @intelligent50 @RichardDawkins It's not specified in Newton's theory of gravity nor Einstein's. Fortunately—since it's known far less accurately than the theories' predictions.
1001803390454779907 2018-05-30 12:31:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BensRoad @MacaesBruno Well yes. Disrespect for truth sabotages political discourse just as it sabotages children's thinking. There's no up-side in either case.
1001795209229938688 2018-05-30 11:59:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MacaesBruno Apologies. Link to what you were referring to?
1001794225611173888 2018-05-30 11:55:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MacaesBruno Increasing speech restrictions in Western society are disgraceful. They are indeed very harmful, but so is the rise of reckless hyperbole.

The former is false; the latter's supposed political implications are false.  I suggest reading The Extended Phenotype, to contradict both.
1001737775471882240 2018-05-30 08:11:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick @TheEconomist Why would anyone want to portray this organisation, currently at war in pursuit of an openly genocidal agenda, as having "embraced peaceful, popular resistance”?  Because if it had, then self-defence against it would be criminal. And it's legitimate to hurt criminals.
1001498729541701632 2018-05-29 16:21:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey The weird cyclical thing is because violence in the Pattern typically arises when the legitimacy of hurting Jews seems under threat, and recedes when Jews are actually hurt with impunity.  The rest: very little idea.
1001429082624741376 2018-05-29 11:44:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @gmusser Surely that depends on what you expect to be approaching from the other side of the trench!
1001427713570336768 2018-05-29 11:39:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> To *legitimise hurting them*. For being Jews. It has already achieved that purpose even if it results in no concrete punishment.  https://t.co/MujAk2OkER

But science is techniques for not fooling oneself *about certain issues*.  Doesn't privilege anything and is just the application of more general techniques for not fooling oneself (viz. reason).  All those techniques are fallible.

1000023630426902528 2018-05-25 14:39:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichardDawkins Better to say: the *argument* that evolution has happened is stronger than, for instance, the argument that smallpox has killed people.
1000022978497785856 2018-05-25 14:37:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichardDawkins Is it wise to let loons dictate terminology?  Switching to "securely established fact" gives them the weapon of pointing to nonexistent things whose existence was once thought to be securely established—such as the force of gravity.
999892574960697344 2018-05-25 05:59:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I only got about 15. But several of those made me sign up again, which took a minute or more each, not three seconds.  https://t.co/nTRgoBNMVD

999669982161227776 2018-05-24 15:14:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist My gut reaction to that case is: ain't gonna happen. That business is not going to close down on the day we leave the Customs Union.
999637313973116928 2018-05-24 13:04:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist I suspect that in addition to curiosity, there is an implicit *argument* underlying this question and the last. Is it that Brexit will have bad consequences that outweigh the good and should therefore be abandoned? Or what?

998153351840886784 2018-05-20 10:47:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist The number of EU nurses registering to work in Britain has fallen but I don't know the reason. Could be the new English-language tests, or many random things. The Remainers' false portrayal of how welcome they'd be is allegedly contributing. To the extent that it is, I'm worried.
998152403819159552 2018-05-20 10:44:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist That's not it. There's a shortage of nurses. In Britain and in the EU too. This is a problem. Moving nurses around can help, but only marginally. The effect of Brexit on moving nurses around is a marginal effect on the marginal effect.
997942289086500864 2018-05-19 20:49:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @n_bresnahan @MatjazLeonardis @clairlemon The term 'conspiracy theory' in current usage does not mean merely the theory that some people somewhere have agreed to do something bad. It is a certain mode of explanation of history or current affairs. And in that usage it is always false.
997930895045734400 2018-05-19 20:04:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @MatjazLeonardis @clairlemon They're not concealing that it is in their private interest though.  And hence no recruitment problem is caused.
997905640625459202 2018-05-19 18:23:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @clairlemon And if it weren't a conscious goal, it would be an extreme coincidence if it were achieved again and again. As, indeed, it never has been.
997905195303604227 2018-05-19 18:21:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @clairlemon So in your example about Parliament, the two ends don't conflict much in terms of policy.  But a policy of continual war in order to cull "excess low-status males" in demographically significant numbers would drastically conflict with the overt political aims of most wars.
997903834583363584 2018-05-19 18:16:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis @clairlemon Conspiracy theory = explanation of history/current affairs claiming that a group openly promotes one end but secretly works towards a *conflicting* one..  Among other things, this would make recruitment to the conspiracy impossible under many circumstances.
997828526815531008 2018-05-19 13:17:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist It's possible but very misleading. But OK. Slightly worried, but not about them as such. About the grief of some Remainers.
997807186645540865 2018-05-19 11:52:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist My question is the first part of my answer (which may turn out to be too long in full for this medium) to yours. It is not rhetorical.
997796154040561665 2018-05-19 11:08:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BenHopeArtist Does the Galileo Project have a purpose other than prestige and to weaken the US militarily? (Serious question.)  Also, the last I heard of it, it was due to go online in 2008. What happened?
997759226855518208 2018-05-19 08:41:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Moddy82 @clairlemon (1) Was unusual. (2) Killed both men and women.
997737809267093504 2018-05-19 07:16:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @clairlemon No. Perhaps I've misunderstood your tweet?
997733516275343362 2018-05-19 06:59:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @clairlemon If war and monogamy were not generally regarded as having that purpose, then this is a conspiracy theory and therefore false.  Also war rarely killed men in demographically significant numbers.
997513472052224000 2018-05-18 16:25:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I was wrong too. I said not one would apologise. One has.  https://t.co/XfX8A1TaGB

996385386862608384 2018-05-15 13:42:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick It's interesting that Hamas, who have a policy of relentless lying to the Western press, often tell the truth when their fighters are killed in action.  It's as if they somehow knew that those particular statements will be totally ignored by the press.

996009668567814144 2018-05-14 12:49:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick It has been known. What's utterly unique is the Pattern of third parties in vast numbers falling over themselves with eagerness to condone this evil.

I think Sowell's *Knowledge and Decisions* is very good on this, though it's decades since I read it.

Then the 1% have children, starve them to death and so on?  Someone whose labour is *almost* worthless because everything can be made so cheaply, doesn't need much to buy food and cloth either.
992880587248676866 2018-05-05 21:35:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @markprobst @MatjazLeonardis That argument depends on the idea that automation will make raw materials MORE expensive than they are now.
992824067395915777 2018-05-05 17:51:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @webdevMason Persuasion is nice but I don't think it should be the main objective of conversing. Even getting them to understand your point isn't.  The objective should be learning fun things.

992377188417712129 2018-05-04 12:15:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan And even aside from the ideology of Marxism, Marx was not merely a *harmless* crank:  https://t.co/Kzh3nddmgn
992376270305529856 2018-05-04 12:11:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DanielJHannan And yet the ideology itself, even aside from all implementations, is arrant nonsense:  https://t.co/I21OCHetgi
992041119658758144 2018-05-03 14:00:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @MatjazLeonardis Mine is much less realistic than that.
992040869028130816 2018-05-03 13:59:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey Hypothetically: Variants of G affect smiling frequency in babies. B = IQ test performance. Fact not known to anyone: all IQ variation caused by amount of parental smiling at baby.

991437297970118656 2018-05-01 22:00:46 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher I've heard that story several times about various speakers. Also, it doesn't sound like Popper.

991406014670008327 2018-05-01 19:56:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HenryIronside @DouglasCarswell I've seen it argued that *any* elected element in the Lords would reduce the legitimacy of the Commons. Which would be very bad. Sounds true to me.
991395230657204224 2018-05-01 19:13:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @HenryIronside @DouglasCarswell So we need reforms to improve the quality. Ideas about what quality is and how to identify it differ greatly so we should proceed with caution.  *Especially* if you take the view that the last reform made matters worse in this regard.
991381894397865984 2018-05-01 18:20:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell It would take experts to craft the details. But there already are conventions (as well as laws) that on certain issues the Lords mustn't thwart the Commons. Salisbury Doctrine, money bills. It seems an anomaly that this doesn't include referendum implementations. I'd start there.
991294215698120704 2018-05-01 12:32:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell No chance that any of those would be for the better. All violate the Burke/Popper principle of tentative reform to solve problems.   The problem of the Lords acting in a way that's legally OK but morally abuses power, can be addressed by far less drastic reforms than abolition.

990486121615372290 2018-04-29 07:01:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick It's a declaration that Jews are not entitled to a right of self-defence, because that conflicts with the legitimacy of hurting them.  The existence of Israel, i.e. of Jewish sovereignty, it a permanent affront, and challenge, to the Pattern, which is why it's focused there.

990185904244494337 2018-04-28 11:08:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher I don't think one can choose whether to change one's opinions, if one is thinking. See Shelley's essay on atheism.

989614299336314880 2018-04-26 21:16:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @Wilhelm_Treffer I should add that the overt 'System' (constitution, electoral system, etc) is just the tip of the iceberg. The real error-correcting institutions are in people's expectations of each other and of the state.
989612562655346688 2018-04-26 21:09:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey @Wilhelm_Treffer E.g. separation of Legislature and Executive limits power but at the cost of greatly diluting leaders' responsibility.

989535022767058945 2018-04-26 16:01:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @noise_random @ProfBrianCox OK what is x such that &gt;x% per cap GDP growth over the next decade will be helpful in understanding that we made a good decision economically?  (Or growth relative—to whom?)  Similarly what is y such that &lt;y%…bad? And between y% and x%…no detectable difference (or not helpful)?

Or that the Anglo-Irish agreement requires Ireland to leave the EU if Britain doesn't stay in the Customs Union.  Yes, preposterous.

But that's a bit unfair/circular. Better to define it as 'computational tasks', including e.g. cryptography or resource constraints, in which case quantum computers have a larger set.

984842057272451072 2018-04-13 17:13:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Marquees_Bird No. But one can't understand *why* something is happening if one has drastic misconceptions about *what* is happening.  Newton couldn't have discovered his law of gravity without first understanding that the planets orbit the sun, not Earth.
984834927979098112 2018-04-13 16:45:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Marquees_Bird Most people with that compulsion, even at the intensity described by O'Neill, can introspect "do I mind sitting near a Jew on a bus…or marrying one…do I favour discrimination against Jews…?" and truly conclude no, they're innocent of all that—and hence that he's smearing them.
984779157258285056 2018-04-13 13:03:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @giggs_boson Much of that is exaggerated, but yeah.
984769600406605829 2018-04-13 12:25:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes, it's a derangement—the most harmful and dangerous in Western society. Very widespread. But *it's not hatred*, though it sometimes causes that. Nor racism (occasionally causes that too). It's a compulsion to legitimise hurting Jews. 'Antisemitism' is a misleading term for it.  https://t.co/5kJh19RNLn

E.g. opposing views aren't heard.  However, even in such societies, only certain lies can be effective. The ones that harness pre-existing irrationality.
983751327334522881 2018-04-10 16:59:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LucACastelein @jonathan_church In short, they don't. What they do is use hyperbole and tendentious language, argue a case without acknowledging the opposing case, etc.  To get a handle on this, it's useful to consider why politicians with whose world-views one agrees lie so much less than their opponents!
983718407630671872 2018-04-10 14:48:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LucACastelein @jonathan_church Most often, a failure, disablement or absence of some critical process in  the listener.

982341655226273792 2018-04-06 19:37:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cwdoan I can think of many grave flaws in the project of trying to understand the world via Newton's theory. Nothing specific for relativity.  I don't think Newton's should have had 'accepted' status in the first place. We're luckier now: our best theories are mutually inconsistent.
982291497637707776 2018-04-06 16:18:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MCStannard @reasonisfun @nntaleb There aren't beliefs. Nor are they, nor any other assurance of success, needed for rational thought.  However, denying that knowledge is attainable in regard to any problem (apparent conflict in ideas) is an appeal to the supernatural. (See my book The Beginning of Infinity.)

982221631140478977 2018-04-06 11:41:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KittJohnson_ Yes. In the same sense that the problem of how to communicate is inborn. And if that's all it is, we won't always be playing catchup. It'll just be cultural knowledge learned in the same way that the meanings of words are – by having fun.
982218587959058433 2018-04-06 11:28:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KittJohnson_ He says 'we' (proponents of free trade) will always be playing catchup because palaeolithic blah. That's biological determinism.  Interpreting an alleged (but actually nonexistent) inborn *falsehood* as an inborn *resistance* to truth.
982216633799159809 2018-04-06 11:21:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WeakEmergence Some of them are preferred (for some purposes) because they seem to have survived criticism that their rivals haven't.  That's not the same as having been accepted—even tentatively. I use quantum theory to understand the world, yet am sure it's false.
982209409924214784 2018-04-06 10:52:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Interesting comments about President Trump, constitutionality, partisanship, changes in the EU that made it unacceptable to him…  Ignore the mistaken and irrelevant argument from biological determinism halfway through.  https://t.co/weKuXObNiZ
982203060771405826 2018-04-06 10:27:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> But there's no such thing as rejection either. Critical preference (Popper) refers to the state of a debate—often complex, inconsistent, and transient.
982203059274067971 2018-04-06 10:27:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> There's no such thing as 'acceptance' of a theory into the realm of science. Theories are conjectures and remain so. (Popper, Miller.)

981254438349426690 2018-04-03 19:37:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Clorwall @reasonisfun It's an abstraction to which we can instantiate approximations. As are TRUE, FALSE, AND, OR and other associated functions.  Doing this is hard and requires creativity. We should do it as much as necessary at any moment, but any more is a waste of creativity.

981222503061311490 2018-04-03 17:30:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @KittJohnson_ @reasonisfun @Clorwall There are no perfectly precise definitions of terms or concepts. So no statement is perfectly free of vagueness.   We can, however, hope to define terms, and make statements, as precisely as the problem requires.  This is separate from the issue of knowing that we have done so.
981216278512832513 2018-04-03 17:06:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Clorwall @reasonisfun In a sense, yes. Ironically, the difficulty of *stating* a satisfactory approximation to the truths that the table is about, as illustrated by this very discussion, also exemplifies the truth in (not of) the table!
981211199911202818 2018-04-03 16:45:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reasonisfun @Clorwall Only propositions have truth values, but we can't utter a proposition! We can only utter statements, which are, at best, approximations to propositions.  This is separate from the issue of certainty, which of course we can't have either.
981209924763029509 2018-04-03 16:40:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Clorwall @reasonisfun Another relevant point is that statements (such as scientific theories) are only approximately *propositions*. The latter are idealisations used in formal logic, with perfectly unambiguous meanings and truth-values.

981154415909507078 2018-04-03 13:00:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's neither true nor fair.  https://t.co/fXAjcd020z

980925131857059840 2018-04-02 21:49:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell Apparently we (the EU) do indeed have a say: we sabotaged the previous plans  https://t.co/b96tXjdXNd
980837910047084544 2018-04-02 16:02:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ConfessionsExMu Tip of the iceberg. Those being criticised now are only the ones so far gone that despite knowing they'd have absolute immunity if they just said 'Zionist' instead, they can't bring themselves to do even that.
980438634011725825 2018-04-01 13:36:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reasonisfun BTW Popper was also concerned with arguing against positivism.
980433428935004160 2018-04-01 13:15:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @ToKTeacher I think that one was dispelled when Gödel, Turing et al. proved that mathematical truth doesn't coincide with provability from any set of axioms.
980389223298723840 2018-04-01 10:19:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This makes important, rarely seen, points  https://t.co/ZvykgafjSS   (Ignore the mis-spelling "Isreal" and the ungrammatical and irrelevant word "challenging" halfway through – both presumably the Editors' fault.)
980353007211765761 2018-04-01 07:55:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Whoa! I hadn't known that the Farm Hall transcripts were on the internet. Nor that that startling thing is on them. Thanks.  https://t.co/vRvTlOkLlM
980166367885299713 2018-03-31 19:34:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ibeckermayer Odd choice for making that argument. Why not the bombing of Dresden or Hiroshima, which were actually ordered and knowingly killed children?
980159061294505984 2018-03-31 19:05:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ibeckermayer No government of an advanced liberal democracy ever has.
980126527349252096 2018-03-31 16:55:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Serious people sometimes explain events in terms of Jews plotting to murder children. The factual absurdity of this is rarely recognised.  https://t.co/2a1yeh272O

979406746052714496 2018-03-29 17:15:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes I think there are two irrationalities here. One—appeasement etc.—began with Rushdie's death sentence and became dominant with 9/11.  The Pattern was already sabotaging political ideas and events throughout the 20th century. The 19th. The Enlightenment. Medieval times. Antiquity…
979356501218353152 2018-03-29 13:56:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @asbjornenge Yes, it's on Kindle and the iBooks store.
979306526233030656 2018-03-29 10:37:25 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @kobevanreppelen @SamHarrisOrg Doesn't matter much. Depends where you're coming from. As you've got both (thanks!), you can use the chapter titles in the Contents to decide.
979301470045646853 2018-03-29 10:17:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes I wish I knew. Typically such irrationalities are coercively inculcated in childhood. That does happen with the Pattern too—it's even central to many cultures. But that doesn't explain its unique consistency over time, locations and societies, nor why it also spreads voluntarily.
979291105496850432 2018-03-29 09:36:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Are Western journalists spreading these incendiary falsehoods deliberately or are they dupes, @richard_landes asks. Neither. It's just that the irrational Pattern of thinking that makes it painful even to hear denials of those falsehoods is widespread in them and their audiences.  https://t.co/vYnet4ccDf
979060251340234752 2018-03-28 18:18:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Never mind religion. The UN defined the presence of Jews in the ancient Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem as a war crime because it is legitimate to hurt war criminals.  https://t.co/yfc2gTGwfX
978940406015684608 2018-03-28 10:22:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EastwoodSane @sapinker Yes—why let packing-efficiency considerations trump that downside? Why let carbon-emissions considerations trump the downsides of ritually unplugging chargers.
978923880667648001 2018-03-28 09:16:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Unapologetically celebrating evil. This happens when the Pattern (of legitimising hurting Jews) trumps the core function of an organisation.  It is increasingly common in mainstream organisations.  https://t.co/nR2D8pbmbM
978703909643485184 2018-03-27 18:42:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jonathan_church In election campaigns—unlike sheep herding—everyone's assertions get contradicted. So if people are misled, it's not by the information per se.

978562981545021440 2018-03-27 09:22:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @colourperfectme My guess is that they do not know. At all. And that is precisely why this is so serious.
978561304733593601 2018-03-27 09:16:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's not a lie, but just as O'Neill says, it's a spectacular falsehood and—what is much worse—a conspiracy theory, the poison of political thought.  https://t.co/PIuzoWn2bG
978342510501220353 2018-03-26 18:46:45 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Internet media can propagate any type of meme but if anything, rational ones have a better chance since there are fewer ways to hurt recipients.  https://t.co/f3V2iCTGJh
978270600081952768 2018-03-26 14:01:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell With conspiracy theories, there's always a way to explain anything. So they're bad explanations.
978233277357150208 2018-03-26 11:32:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cm_richards @TheAnnaGat @kevomics Conspiracy theories are FAR more common, and typically more dangerous, than actual conspiracies.
978180763647643649 2018-03-26 08:04:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cm_richards @kevomics @TheAnnaGat Ah. So in fact Facebook does not do this unless you tell it to. And the rest is conspiracy theory.
978066111362191366 2018-03-26 00:28:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It does indeed seem so. In educational theory this takes the form: "children are so inherently gullible that you can't persuade them of anything".  https://t.co/CnN8lL6fBd
978052456272859136 2018-03-25 23:34:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @TheAnnaGat I wasn't referring to that! Does that happen? Which phone and e-mail providers do that?
978047593241546754 2018-03-25 23:14:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Seems some people deleted their social media accounts because the internet persuaded them they're too gullible to risk reading ideas on the internet.  Sad. Yet somehow appropriate.
977552898820313088 2018-03-24 14:29:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @BoltzmannBody Changes can be for the better or worse. 'Harms the language' is explained e.g. here:  https://t.co/22LznLbham   Trying to 'restrict' bad changes would be bad. Expressing opinions about which are good or bad is good.
977549389676843008 2018-03-24 14:15:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Refuting either of them takes a lot of effort (it's always easier to accuse than to defend) and risks implicitly condoning the other.
977549388540252160 2018-03-24 14:15:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> As often in the Pattern, the underlying allegation is false, AND is interpreted via ancient tropes legitimising violence:  https://t.co/NKAkDAkQS9
977505830252830721 2018-03-24 11:22:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So does over-use of hyperbole in general. President Trump has caused a wave of it among all factions, causing misunderstanding and bad feeling.
977501580206530560 2018-03-24 11:05:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The article is wrong. Over-use of hyperbole with a particular word is just a special case of using the word with a wrong meaning, and harms the language.  https://t.co/MimJLmoxQT

977122567269048320 2018-03-23 09:59:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @adamthesherwood The usual case is that no alternative theory has occurred to me. For instance, it has never until this moment occurred to me that paving stones may be carnivorous.

976806690594213889 2018-03-22 13:03:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> We aren't. No such assumption is needed under critical rationalism because no assurance of success is needed or possible.  https://t.co/SCVDZcaVb1

Also, criticising particular ideas for being flawed shouldn't be mistaken for criticising people for having particular positions.

972244650865160193 2018-03-09 22:56:02 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MBuell01 Yes. When one can expect no new knowledge affecting the system in question to be created in the period.  E.g. economic theory predicts  that if you don't pay your monthly rent, your landlord will try to contact you.
972034469162110976 2018-03-09 09:00:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> I mean the theory and model used here:  https://t.co/hSe63F9VxD to to prophesy the immediate (pre-leaving) impact of a Leave result of the Referendum. I.e. to prophesy what would be happening right now.  https://t.co/NDHJeKDkJp

970572919331065857 2018-03-05 08:13:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It is extremely difficult to measure knowledge, or even mere skill, in an exam. Exam tasks mostly test skill at navigating a certain cultural landscape, and only secondarily the intended skills. Trick questions like that one deliberately magnify this source of inaccuracy.

968893117448499201 2018-02-28 16:58:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jwonsm No, because these things aren't sets. They're something like multisets with measure.
968854632507281408 2018-02-28 14:25:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's an unexplained phenomenon. But one can't explain WHY something happens if one is badly mistaken about WHAT happens.   E.g.

965612496877957121 2018-02-19 15:42:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This mostly makes good sense but if "the Trump administration has neither developed nor deployed a coherent Russia policy", how can that be the fault of the opposition?  https://t.co/MuDjUhcv2h
965571831691382787 2018-02-19 13:00:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EastwoodSane @swilkinsonbc I disagree. The apartheid lie is not only salient, it is the entire reason why this local zoning dispute is being raised internationally.

964848101759635456 2018-02-17 13:04:48 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Following the 1972 massacre of Israeli athletes in Munich there was a letter in The Times (I think) saying "please don't publish a letter from Christopher Mayhew MP saying 'while not condoning this, I nevertheless condone it'", followed by a letter from Mayhew saying just that.  https://t.co/dkjyDn9SWo
964842245345218561 2018-02-17 12:41:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Falsificationism: The idea that scientific theories consist of their predictions and if an observation contradicts a theory it is proved false and must be dropped.  That is not Popper's (or anyone's) philosophy. I hate to think what *dogmatic* falsificationism might be.  https://t.co/wJkq69FJBQ
964583308809179136 2018-02-16 19:32:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes.

The net effect is an increase, but not by as much as if that same matter were not a knowledge creator.
964120477810663424 2018-02-15 12:53:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Weird because it actually said the EU is *no longer* a corpse &amp; Brexit Britain should rejoice in the opportunities that will create.  https://t.co/FJBx210HgD
964054223808880640 2018-02-15 08:30:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jfitzsimons The difficulty stems from trying not to mention the multiverse. The real challenge is to convey why *everything* isn't sped up.
963819963432751104 2018-02-14 16:59:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 @DKedmey Yes but 'similar' implies a non-trivial correspondence mapping anyway. Newton sits in a different chair in most universes in which his knowledge is similar.

That distinction is essential to explanations in psychology, morality and law.  Erasing it on grounds of determinism, indeterminism or reductionism is a mistake.
963785676281073664 2018-02-14 14:43:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LestaNediam @tonofbuns In an explanation.
963762299407347712 2018-02-14 13:10:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @LestaNediam @tonofbuns It's more like: an act where the decisive knowledge to do it or not was created inside your mind. So neither automatism nor pure obedience.
963740068883107841 2018-02-14 11:41:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Also, the EU proposal for a “full membership without a veto” transition contradicts the argument that a transition period is needed for the sake of gradualness.  https://t.co/CGuaQusEr3

963522452616810496 2018-02-13 21:17:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @iaminsidetheegg @realTomHa @DKedmey Don't know but I can think of several interrelated reasons that must motivate some of them. For instance, that for many on both sides, 'evolution' entails 'nothing special about humans' and hence moral relativism, naturalism, etc.
963514650506809344 2018-02-13 20:46:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @bnielson01 In philosophical disputes one can rarely specify what would change one's mind, however open minded one is. Because it would be an explanation that one currently thinks impossible. And if one could specify that in advance, one would already have it, or at least a sketch of it.
963513173642014725 2018-02-13 20:40:16 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Good point.  https://t.co/lgtnbcPaXK

963509228982894593 2018-02-13 20:24:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @realTomHa @DKedmey Yes. See The Fabric of Reality. E.g. p192.
963504431953252352 2018-02-13 20:05:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey Not as far as is known. But differentiation is an emergent process so one can't ask about that in terms of a continuum like time.   Yes: create knowledge-&gt;less. Randomness-&gt;more.

Counterfactuals could in principle exist under classical laws too. (If they conformed to constructor theory…) Also free will is needed in emergent-level explanations, not microscopic ones.

Well, for a start:  It's just not true that the perpetrators of the Holocaust were mindless functionaries or coerced or a small minority. Those are fantasies.  They were doing—deliberately, enthusiastically and with excess cruelty—what they thought was right.
961493946663829504 2018-02-08 06:56:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @SamuelLaHood It is ruled out because it isn't an explanation. See my book The Beginning of Infinity, Chapter 4 'Creation', especially pp79-81.

Months later @nokia intentionally damaged it, remotely, from the internet:  https://t.co/ch8kAZVOly …  No doubt the small print in the licence agreement legally entitles them to do this.

959691545250271232 2018-02-03 07:34:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Blaming slavery for (supposedly) producing income/wealth inequalities is like blaming it for producing cotton.

958259786830753792 2018-01-30 08:45:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @psybertron Attributing all good things to the leader is nowhere a tradition except where despots already rule.  Unlike Mussolini's punctuality achievement, the tax cuts are real and due to the President, but there is no tradition requiring them to be called good. All opinions are expressed.

956830134367121409 2018-01-26 10:04:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> No, a monkey with a dartboard would have guessed too high some of the time. Politically impartial experts, half the time.  That all major forecasts were too low requires an explanation.  https://t.co/K8H6mAyUxC

956773982518349825 2018-01-26 06:21:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Maybe. But they were insufficient, else they would have done so after 500, or 0. Something extra was needed.

E.g. some people say they were persuaded to vote Leave in the EU Referendum by realising what the arguments for Remain were.  There are much more subtle examples too.
956411275155734528 2018-01-25 06:19:51 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. Having escaped from curricula, 'face the front' and 'what did I just say?', many people think it's now their job to do that to themselves.  https://t.co/VQkS7nOIPJ

Rather, by increasing the other parties' fear of falling to 3rd place if UKIP rose to 2nd. Millions were voting UKIP precisely to have that effect. As its subsequent collapse shows.

954722305665626113 2018-01-20 14:28:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 It's all framed in terms of which categories of people are morally entitled to hurt others. E.g. the majority, the needy, etc.  Instead of e.g. what institutions best allow mistakes about moral (and other) issues to be corrected.
954712655536840704 2018-01-20 13:50:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey Maybe "don't destroy the means of correcting errors". Dunno how useful that is IRL though.   Constructor theory – maybe after there's a CT of knowledge. Don't hold your breath.
954663724304031745 2018-01-20 10:35:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @georgeawright Perhaps if the people were enemy soldiers?
954639511690018816 2018-01-20 08:59:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Also the questions implicitly assume  the "who should rule" mistake criticised by Popper, and Lenin's "who, whom" world view.

953631890937925634 2018-01-17 14:15:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Therefore reading comprehension tests don't measure reading comprehension. At all.  https://t.co/JDoiZ5jcSN

952616734535667712 2018-01-14 19:01:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> A mirror image of the present controversy, where few disagree factually but all feel obliged to condemn so they condemn the supposed intention.
952615807225401344 2018-01-14 18:58:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Few agreed—but the remark was hard to contradict without also opposing its purpose namely, in context, to legitimise hurting Jews. So, silence.  https://t.co/vAYsfYDubs

952163456920227840 2018-01-13 13:00:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasKMurray Apt phrase: "Social Justice Savonarolas".
951864714530840576 2018-01-12 17:13:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> That's a bit harsh.

951627516535623680 2018-01-12 01:30:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> We should accelerate research into diverse, innovative types of geoengineering, with a view to implementing many.

951568493748609024 2018-01-11 21:36:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> "And even if by chance he were to utter The perfect truth, he would himself not know it" (Xenophanes via Popper again.)  https://t.co/YQbUSeN8sc

951565058919817217 2018-01-11 21:22:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @IsTelos Through creative conjecture and criticism we try to find and remove errors and so progress, tentatively, from problems to better problems.   "But as for certain truth, no man has known it, Nor will he know it" (Popper's translation of a Xenophanes fragment.)
951549095096745990 2018-01-11 20:19:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Something like a debate between Martin Rees and me on The Current:  https://t.co/QoOYBS8S58 Starts at about 1:12.
951542611839455232 2018-01-11 19:53:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> E.g. "Actually no suffering is pointless because…[God/Evolution/Honour/etc.] says we're not fully human till we experience suffering." To oppose that, we need an argument. An axiom won't do.

951367509273468928 2018-01-11 08:17:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's worse than appeasement. It's equating right and wrong: moral relativism, whose dark logic entails siding with wrong against right.  https://t.co/7BpKrKVuyy

949338535177400322 2018-01-05 17:55:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Demonstrations have known outcomes produced by obeying instructions. Experiments: the opposite. Experiments can be good or bad.

949022468211204097 2018-01-04 20:59:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Inductivist problem yes. Also a mechanical criterion—leads to 'modern art', or the Occupy movement. And can tacitly introduce an objective.
949016634009817089 2018-01-04 20:36:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Also, overcoming 'deceptiveness' is only a small part of the reason why fun is the only good criterion.

948667937350672386 2018-01-03 21:30:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Suppose brain studies determine that the greatest possible wellbeing is the experience of proving there's an infinity of prime pairs. That proves the theorem!  https://t.co/eBhGdCdZFs

922444024161726464 2017-10-23 12:46:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Dam_Nuwen @DanielJHannan *Two* attempts! One successful.
922408742431477761 2017-10-23 10:25:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Dam_Nuwen @DanielJHannan That's indeed a misconception—inductivism/prophecy—as is 'my country does X so yours will too'. But Hannan is explaining the past, not prophesying.
922251240259670016 2017-10-23 00:00:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Dam_Nuwen For an explanation for why it won't happen in the UK despite greed and stupidity. I recommend the Introduction of @DanielJHannan's book on Freedom.
922193254162096129 2017-10-22 20:09:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WhoDHOOo Yes—but the operative part is in people's minds. Buildings, written laws and people who operate them are just the tip of the institution iceberg.
922181010728603650 2017-10-22 19:21:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jlahnsteiner "Relatively" is implied.
922180600756408320 2017-10-22 19:19:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Dam_Nuwen But he won't. For exactly the same reason.
922180483731124224 2017-10-22 19:18:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ShippeyGordon Indeed.
922180307696128002 2017-10-22 19:18:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WhoDHOOo It can't be just that, because all governments think they're following that even when they do those things.
922135682734346240 2017-10-22 16:20:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The UK Parliament has the *legal power* to take over everything in Britain—and for that matter in Spain too. It won't, because of something more powerful than any law.  https://t.co/RFrll9jEpA
922098926269992960 2017-10-22 13:54:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EvanOLeary @l__ds You mean given any accuracy, it happens with that accuracy in some universes? Yes, but 'possible' in constructor theory means reliably possible.
922032511257137152 2017-10-22 09:30:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> This is identical to Steve Jobs' policy of not doing market research but just making "insanely great" products  https://t.co/Wdh1yVaI84  https://t.co/OrbiILZX5E
922027343316766720 2017-10-22 09:10:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey E.g. it might explain how different two entities have to be to be two people. And whether, and which, qualia are essential to personhood

921466848960565248 2017-10-20 20:03:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes, but also: there shouldn't be classes, just lectures. And lecturers shouldn't ever address students, only reply when they ask.  https://t.co/eOK0mJ1mKk

921266830349619200 2017-10-20 06:48:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> And to Brett Hall @ToKTeacher  https://t.co/vaHgB7yQBS  https://t.co/A4QMozVxvf
921117573596491776 2017-10-19 20:55:17 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dogsturnleft @DavidSossin This is a good example of how having Primary elections violates Popper's criterion. Responsibility dissipated to everyone and hence owned by no one.
920994807534837761 2017-10-19 12:47:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ScumbagTheDog Useful, thanks. So "meteorite impact crater", then.
920971529923461120 2017-10-19 11:14:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Astronomers: is it "meteor impact crater" or "meteorite impact crater"? And does it make a difference whether it's on Earth or the moon?
920918860836024320 2017-10-19 07:45:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MatjazLeonardis Yes. And everyone who feels psychologically unable to quit their job, opens the door for their employer to ill-treat them.

919663331723628544 2017-10-15 20:36:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes. Wealth should be understood objectively as the set of transformations one is capable of causing. E.g 30 minutes' work → a month of Netflix.  https://t.co/hSAKWOSIpX
919590688676892673 2017-10-15 15:48:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidSossin E.g. (for me): Isolationism, protectionism, appeasement, multiculturalism, moral relativism, 'political correctness', scientism.

919530270902104064 2017-10-15 11:47:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion Same for Remainers/Leavers in the UK, by the way. A wave of increased ad hominem spite has swept over all political sides in both nations.
919529319835291648 2017-10-15 11:44:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion The incidence of irrationality and ignoble personal attributes is no different among Trump voters than the rest of us.
919479594457206786 2017-10-15 08:26:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's fun to vent, but this is not an accurate description of Americans.  https://t.co/8cZyXwh5Up
919225313850281984 2017-10-14 15:36:07 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @terrymorse @ToKTeacher That's a human command not a law of physics. If it were the latter, the thing wouldn't be an extinguisher and the command wouldn't be needed.
919128496852619264 2017-10-14 09:11:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @realTomHa No, that entails violating the criterion. See The Fabric of Reality ch2.
919125426273968129 2017-10-14 08:59:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @realTomHa The criterion should be "if it's needed in our best explanation of something, it's real". See The Beginning of Infinity p23.
919116217968885760 2017-10-14 08:22:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jordanbpeterson @ToKTeacher This is the apparent paradox of a *tradition of criticism* (Popper). They are not impossible: our civilisation is built on them.

918917041544982528 2017-10-13 19:11:10 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WhoDHOOo Yes, all copies, of course.
918916056957243393 2017-10-13 19:07:15 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @inayatb That particular policy is debatable (and debated) and morally very complex. However, criticism is not the same as UN resolutions.
918889472636354561 2017-10-13 17:21:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @reasonisfun @paulg He means "expressing ideas using the fewest words best conveys what they are". I infer that he didn't know what that idea was. ;)
918778544225968128 2017-10-13 10:00:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Nor did he denounce the 46 resolutions against Israel. Because he considered them legitimate. He's not alone in this. There's a Pattern.  https://t.co/a6yrx5ngDg

918392659143806977 2017-10-12 08:27:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @al45tair @DouglasCarswell No it's *intellectuals* who are most vulnerable to intellectual fads. (Which, by the way, is one reason why IQ is a bad concept.)
918385590176972800 2017-10-12 07:59:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DouglasCarswell 26% prepared to endorse blatant nonsense if it provides an opportunity to signal allegiance to the idea of European union. Worrying.

918166855772229632 2017-10-11 17:30:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 That makes it seem rickety. The real thing isn't. Al least replace 2 by computational universality.
918142635780575232 2017-10-11 15:53:57 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @saphena @cinnamonbear14b Does "more often than not" have its usual meaning of 'more than half' of the agendas? Or more than our 'fair share'? Or what?

916645513012838400 2017-10-07 12:44:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RJsnda You mean the increasing references to boredom? Sartre-type cases may indicate a loss of gumption, but people expecting more to have fun is great.
916618518577152001 2017-10-07 10:57:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ScumbagTheDog You're right. I shouldn't have been like "someone tell me why it's a good idea". I should be fine with it unless I have a reason why it's bad.
916616931855216640 2017-10-07 10:51:21 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @kitt00449687 The second requires AGI or human-level thinking and the first doesn't necessarily.

916280902279421952 2017-10-06 12:36:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @snoreydude @sapinker Whether e.g. the police, or the President, are regarded by tradition as government or citizens, deeply affects the nature of society.
916276364646416385 2017-10-06 12:18:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @snoreydude @sapinker As I said, traditions, not a priori principles, determine whether there is rule of law etc.
916215587797454848 2017-10-06 08:16:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @lonewolfdion @jordanbpeterson They mean something else by the term. What they endorse and I oppose is: it's significantly harder to write left-wing texts on PCs than Macs.
916212326616981505 2017-10-06 08:03:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @snoreydude @sapinker Yes. One aspect of the US conception is: government and governed are the same type of person. Same rights, subject to the same laws.
916035265185173505 2017-10-05 20:20:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sapinker But that, in turn, depends on a political tradition embodying a certain conception of a citizen.
916015586295123971 2017-10-05 19:01:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jasosilver Yes, and yes.
916009767033868288 2017-10-05 18:38:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Clorwall @ToKTeacher And 'reliable' is misleading too. It suggests some kind of assurance that no error have got through, or probably hasn't. And that's not available.
916006796208361480 2017-10-05 18:26:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Clorwall @ToKTeacher Yes but misleading. I don't trust Fred further than I can throw him, but I think he sharpens his knives well, so I expect them to cut well.
916005214481764357 2017-10-05 18:20:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Clorwall @ToKTeacher Yes. We should look for ideas that have gone through error correction that we consider appropriate to the problem we face.

914226690691387392 2017-09-30 20:33:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 Information = copiable &amp; distinguishable; interoperable. Knowledge = abstract constructor. Yes, e.g. in my Synthese paper.
914070855516377088 2017-09-30 10:14:09 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @dela3499 It distinguishes knowledge from information. But distinguishing between types of knowledge…? Dunno but I'd guess yes.

912659929361784832 2017-09-26 12:47:38 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick I say "strong" because there are strong reasons not to. Pursuing the Pattern entails parting company with reason and morality very early on.
912659445347471360 2017-09-26 12:45:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick Not necessarily—but it's definitely part of the Pattern of legitimising hurting Jews. No one pursues this without having a strong desire to.

911654283371843585 2017-09-23 18:11:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @StephenPiment It's not teleology to trace the events in history that led to particular aspects of the present in which one is interested.
911643083770662914 2017-09-23 17:27:03 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @gleason_colum Macaulay—far from portraying Whig triumph as inevitable—stressed both its horrible vulnerability to chance, and the decisive power of ideas.
911633173934673920 2017-09-23 16:47:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @gleason_colum Yes but ALSO on ideas. Marathon could have gone either way—that doesn't mean the result was independent of what the sides were fighting for.
911592493569003522 2017-09-23 14:06:01 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @gleason_colum I'd be amazed if that were so in either case. Being powerless and thwarted isn't a good way to learn to make choices morally. Freedom is.
911270492815929344 2017-09-22 16:46:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sapinker Did the previous Administration &amp; party not do anything, propose anything, that voters might have thought morally wrong, and voted against?
911269484610097159 2017-09-22 16:42:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @sapinker Seems 'sociotropic voting' is a derogatory term for voting for what one deems morally right—which what voters in the Anglosphere usually do.

909702690569060354 2017-09-18 08:56:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Indeed. Given the fuss, I looked up Johnson's speech and thought I must have clicked the wrong link. It was nothing like what was reported.  https://t.co/QbIOIIivz2

900023276012961792 2017-08-22 15:54:05 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @clrutland A summary of the cause of the stability is in @DanielJHannan's book on freedom. The bigger picture: institutions of criticism—see Popper..

899921108178132992 2017-08-22 09:08:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> So does a school scoring highly at exam results suggest that it's good at teaching, or good at instilling obedience? Or are those the same?  https://t.co/1neOu8dRFZ

898875414365577216 2017-08-19 11:52:53 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @cellsatwork @DanielJHannan That "have to" is the assumption of protectionism. But some non-protectionists feel bereaved too, so that can't be the reason in their case.

898835329028894720 2017-08-19 09:13:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @realTomHa @Evolutionistrue It can happen. But it can't be the origin of the *knowledge* in biological adaptations. Which is the problem Paley set and Darwin solved.

898829090563780608 2017-08-19 08:48:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @realTomHa @Evolutionistrue Experiencing a problem doesn't tell you the solution.
898827309498630145 2017-08-19 08:41:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Evolutionistrue Knowledge is created by conjecture and criticism—in Darwin's theory, mutation and natural selection. Lamarckism tries to do without either.
898824841121349632 2017-08-19 08:31:56 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Evolutionistrue Lamarckism is false, not because DNA doesn't work that way, but because nothing could: it would be creating knowledge out of nothing.
898592190682861569 2017-08-18 17:07:27 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @averykimball No such thing as "statistical reasoning". We can reason about probabilities of EVENTS given a theory. But theories don't have probabilities.

897790402492846081 2017-08-16 12:01:26 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RobbFishwick @DKedmey E.g. it only gives meanings to factual (in the multiverse) counterfactuals. Not ones like 'what if the laws of physics said so-and-so?'
897784583814598659 2017-08-16 11:38:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick Both expressions mean 'it is legitimate to hurt Jews'. This has further implications and connotations, different in different societies.
897617811073372160 2017-08-16 00:35:37 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DKedmey Yes most imaginable (and unimaginable) universes aren't part of the multiverse. E.g. ones in which quantum theory isn't true.
897439914928812033 2017-08-15 12:48:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @londongal984 Stressing similarities and not differences between parties in dispute effectively attacks the party in the right while feigning objectivity.

890215883012009984 2017-07-26 14:23:00 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MartinWalshDLS Do you mean "a free flow of people" in the sense that there currently is between Britain and the US, or some other sense?

888108110883069953 2017-07-20 18:47:28 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @old_pyjamas I think 84% of teachers should study Quantum Theory 101. What's your ideal number for teenagers and mathematics and how do you arrive at it?
888076949683396608 2017-07-20 16:43:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @E_A_Blair @ToKTeacher It would be if anyone advocated tolerance of literally everything. Maybe by calling it a paradox Popper was mocking tolerance of intolerance

888007464892989441 2017-07-20 12:07:32 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ToKTeacher I guess he's referring to the "Paradox of Tolerance" described e.g. in *The Open Society and its Enemies*. (Not actually a paradox!)

887642925403951104 2017-07-19 11:58:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @nadiaf2017 Depends what aspects interest you. Maybe *Conjectures and Refutations*.
887641085274718208 2017-07-19 11:51:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @WeakEmergence @sapinker @ProTruthPledge I see what you did there 😉. However, seriously: I'm not deferring to experts but agreeing with them. The pledge is defying the best experts.
887629003359694848 2017-07-19 11:03:40 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Eaterofsun @sapinker @ProTruthPledge See e.g. Popper's "Knowledge Without Authority", which is online somewhere.

887624833512738816 2017-07-19 10:47:06 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Eaterofsun @sapinker @ProTruthPledge Well, yes, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. (Also 'falsificationist' is a somewhat misleading term for Popper's philosophy.)
887298258560843776 2017-07-18 13:09:24 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Yes disgraceful—but it's a disgraceful side-effect of something good, namely an ingrained reluctance to allow the state to control children.  https://t.co/7GdswyjNgp

887261339604930561 2017-07-18 10:42:42 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Why is 'number of species' the measure of biodiversity? That's like measuring a library's literary diversity by the number of book titles.
886519517333139457 2017-07-16 09:34:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @yaacovlozowick Interpreting 'no longer compulsory reading' as "banned" is a lie whose effect is to legitimise violence.
886247689045848065 2017-07-15 15:34:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Sunsidhe A case in point, I guess. There seems to be a cultural chasm between the fields of quantum gravity and foundations of quantum information.
886225306385776640 2017-07-15 14:05:52 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ian_lieberman @MarlowNYC @SamHarrisOrg Also pretty bad is his tendency to use wildly hyperbolic rhetoric—like calling things the worst ever when they're at most pretty bad, right?
886214657060548609 2017-07-15 13:23:33 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> When quantum-gravity people say quantum they rarely have entanglement at the forefront of their minds—like this does  https://t.co/KONFkslo8j
886154298496864257 2017-07-15 09:23:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PdeVietien @jord_stern I guess the phenomenon of 'conserved quantity not conserved in individual universes' doesn't always involve entanglement, nor vice-versa.
886147905547055105 2017-07-15 08:58:19 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @MarlowNYC @SamHarrisOrg Was it really the "absolute worst", given that many reactions were to support, condone, reinterpret, or deflect attention from, the murders?

885485560248381440 2017-07-13 13:06:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @PdeVietien Thanks. 'Quantum teleportation' doesn't transmit objects, only their states. The explanation of how it works is here  https://t.co/9gJAfT8p7e

873201447453827072 2017-06-09 15:33:43 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @richard_landes Yes, it's meant to hurt Jews by shitting on them. More fundamentally, it's meant to legitimise hurting them by normalising shitting on them.
872838123750817792 2017-06-08 15:29:59 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @ProfBrianCox Could you upgrade that to a testable prediction? (Some people say we still 'haven't recovered' from diverse long-past events they opposed.)

871348862153306112 2017-06-04 12:52:12 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @rickygervais The policy then was not "just saying Fuck You!".
871291275533856769 2017-06-04 09:03:22 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @EVKontorovich The purpose of the hashtag is not to end any occupation. It is to advocate, and so legitimise, the 'teeth', i.e. the hurting of Jews.

702597679017230336 2016-02-24 20:55:14 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> .@ShawnxHernandez @humanprogress Easily possible. But the article claims to be about threats, not comparing the present day with the past.
702596143046369281 2016-02-24 20:49:08 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> .@humanprogress Trump has none, but the others you cite do. To contradict them you'd need a rival explanation, not just data and prophecy.
702594304359993344 2016-02-24 20:41:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> .@humanprogress This is wrong. 'Threat' refers to the future. Those graphs refer to the past. Gauging threats requires explanatory theories.

418421508101251072 2014-01-01 16:40:36 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Why don't we seed Venus with extremophile bacteria? It could have wonderful consequences. Is there any downside?
412863317804204033 2013-12-17 08:34:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Kasparov63 @billis820 @freddoso Most menial tasks that ever existed are already done by technology. Who empties the chamber pots today?
412511658674634752 2013-12-16 09:16:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @jamesmarcusbach @gmelnik See pp191-3 of The Beginning of Infinity.
411777274103332864 2013-12-14 08:38:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Kasparov63 I hope Niels Bohr never said that. Unfortunately he did say several things that he should have known better than to say.
402551435390234624 2013-11-18 21:38:35 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @irondavy If you mean a cosmic computer, I think it's a bad explanation. See pp189-91 of The Beginning of Infinity.
402181774983184384 2013-11-17 21:09:41 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @millsbaker Thanks for the thought.
402181091261296640 2013-11-17 21:06:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @Devotio41640324 Because otherwise the story wouldn't adequately illustrate the counterintuitive fact about infinity that it is designed to.

392959377948160000 2013-10-23 10:23:11 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @blablablus1 Eventually.
389803117736251392 2013-10-14 17:21:20 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @listojiten On pp191-3.
387845264112758784 2013-10-09 07:41:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichardDawkins But the piece overall is real argument about an interesting philosophical issue, so I assume that's just a clumsy sentence.
387725529123549185 2013-10-08 23:45:44 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichardDawkins True. I don't know what she meant by that.
387704325390098432 2013-10-08 22:21:29 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichardDawkins By "brains" she means "minds". A common enough idiom. And she's saying nothing ridiculous.
385176606601273344 2013-10-01 22:57:13 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichardDawkins What on Earth is "humbled"? Be deservedly proud.
360424659851821058 2013-07-25 15:41:49 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @RichardDawkins But illogical. Should be "if evolution is *false*". Theory of evolution doesn't claim evolved designs are optimal.

344465021658607617 2013-06-11 14:43:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @aeonmag @Cornell That isn't worth calling a self-replicating robot. Such a robot would have to use only naturally occurring raw materials.
339696719895883776 2013-05-29 10:56:23 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> As usual, trying to understand entanglement via wave-function collapse makes one very confused about what's going on:  http://t.co/m9lcwm4oNg

303802298717569024 2013-02-19 09:44:47 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The argument "there's no free will because we're made of atoms" is isomorphic to "number theory is just the study of mathematicians' brains"
303181897838780416 2013-02-17 16:39:31 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> If only advocates of shut-up-&amp;-calculate interpretations of quantum theory would do so! What they really do is talk nonsense and calculate.
277791480884649985 2012-12-09 15:07:04 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> It's rather strange that a country would call itself Norway, Austria, or Great Britain.
274176852145364992 2012-11-29 15:43:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The press *should* have a "licence to print lies" (subject only to laws of libel, espionage etc). That's what freedom of speech *is*.

255982992110018560 2012-10-10 10:47:55 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> The modern use of 'like' in "He was, like, 'No way!'" is a useful addition to the language. Expresses ideas cumbersome to express otherwise.
254865877105786880 2012-10-07 08:48:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @AyseErinc @MAasim01 @RichardDawkins Yes it's a brilliant universe. But murderous. If a god runs it, He's manifestly not placated by faith.
253811695934373889 2012-10-04 10:59:58 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidDeutschOxf They've removed the scare quotes from "racist". Thanks, Guardian. And thanks Aeon for taking this up with them.
253473388360769536 2012-10-03 12:35:39 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @DavidDeutschOxf I wrote that favouring carbon brains over silicon is racist; The Guardian put that in quotes: "racist". That was racist.

251629283779416064 2012-09-28 10:27:50 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @michaelshermer Yes, correlation≠causation. One needs an explanatory theory to connect them. In this case, is your explanation Keynesian?
251003023692804097 2012-09-26 16:59:18 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Will Highfield contradict the you-didn't-discover-that view of science, or just say having scientific heroes is useful?  http://t.co/47lrYKvU
250536095119454208 2012-09-25 10:03:54 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> @NurettinTan @RichardDawkins No that's like believing in God because living things exist. There'd be rational explanation for how they knew.
250209592347340801 2012-09-24 12:26:30 +0000 <DavidDeutschOxf> Wouldn't any ET with technology to harm us, also be able to detect us even if we never broadcast, by measuring our atmosphere's composition?
