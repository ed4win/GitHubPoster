1637354458064752640 2023-03-19 07:24:58 +0000 <naval> @gfodor I also asked it to make predictions and propose tests, which made the answers more interesting.   Very impressed with its search, retrieval, and modeling. Mind-blowing good.   But didn‚Äôt see  true creativity or sentience.
1635136751319801856 2023-03-13 04:32:35 +0000 <naval> Someday, we will look back and realize that there were only two banks all along.  The Federal Reserve, the fully centralized bank, and all of its branches, and‚Ä¶  Bitcoin, the fully decentralized bank, and all of its stepchildren.

1634998126028394497 2023-03-12 19:21:44 +0000 <naval> The Internet only tolerates complete centralization and complete decentralization.  Everything in between gets destroyed.

1634349237730435072 2023-03-11 00:23:17 +0000 <naval> @martkerr Why? Until they draw a line, do you know exactly where the Fed will draw a line? Why take a chance?
1634348760741588992 2023-03-11 00:21:23 +0000 <naval> Obviously do your own homework and this is not financial advice.
1634348341546074114 2023-03-11 00:19:44 +0000 <naval> Startups who got their money out can put their first $250K into FDIC backed accounts or $1M into (Insured Cash Sweep) accounts.   Rest can go into  https://t.co/3LFOsZE5uS or BTC / ETH if comfortable with crypto risk.  No point in taking bank risk until the Fed steps in.
1634321495194480640 2023-03-10 22:33:03 +0000 <naval> @LiveFromVR Three month bills instead of savings account. That‚Äôs what generally happens during a banking crisis.

I agree that neither bankers, nor bondholders, nor shareholders should be bailed out.   This is strictly about depositors and to prevent a system-wide rout of all deposits across all banks.
1634318555444580353 2023-03-10 22:21:22 +0000 <naval> @phlndrws Not necessarily. I suspect SVB has a solvency problem. A bond on their books paying 1.7% interest for 10 years isn‚Äôt worth their purchase price.   A depositor getting paid in nominal dollars ten years from now isn‚Äôt getting their money back.
1634315841163628545 2023-03-10 22:10:35 +0000 <naval> If businesses lose money on deposit, then every business in the country will move all cash above $250K into Treasuries and we‚Äôll have a system-wide bank run at Twitter speed.   They‚Äôll tell their banker, ‚Äúthe only counterparty I want is the US Treasury.‚Äù

1594017314927566848 2022-11-19 17:18:37 +0000 <naval> Network effects are incredibly hard to break and Twitter, built on a follow graph rather than on a friend graph, has the most powerful network effect in social.  Twitter isn‚Äôt going anywhere unless they shut the site down and keep it off.

1589343941706776576 2022-11-06 19:48:18 +0000 <naval> Twitter isn‚Äôt valuable because of a few widely followed accounts.   It‚Äôs valuable because of a constant stream of up-and-coming accounts.

1588936833060450304 2022-11-05 16:50:36 +0000 <naval> Democratizing verification levels the playing field, exposes bots, and frees the bird from advertisers.  However, signal-boosting replies from verified accounts is a pay-to-play and penalizes the small but insightful accounts that make Twitter worthwhile.
1588806261583515648 2022-11-05 08:11:46 +0000 <naval> People trying to kill Twitter are about to discover how powerful network effects can be.

1576477906569601024 2022-10-02 07:43:17 +0000 <naval> @punk6529 I agree. Hopefully China and India will see that they don‚Äôt want every Asian neighbor arming up and lean hard on Putin. ü§û
1576475505640939521 2022-10-02 07:33:44 +0000 <naval> @punk6529 Completely agreed.   Given that they abstained on the UN resolution condemning annexation, given that China wants to keep its options open on Taiwan, and given that the US is now appealing to them publicly, I suspect that won‚Äôt work.
1576473357704257536 2022-10-02 07:25:12 +0000 <naval> @PaulRBerg @lucyxliu Popper‚Äôs point was to stop what Deutsch calls ‚Äúanti-rational memes.‚Äù In other words, stop censorship, stop people who want to stop the debate.

1576472455983472642 2022-10-02 07:21:37 +0000 <naval> @punk6529 This is true, but unless we add Ukraine to NATO immediately and threaten M.A.D., I don‚Äôt see a way out.

1576453012544897025 2022-10-02 06:04:21 +0000 <naval> @ComplexDigi The UN is a venue for negotiation, not an armed hegemon.
1576450980350087168 2022-10-02 05:56:17 +0000 <naval> @unserioso @aeyakovenko Because Putin is cornered. It‚Äôs time to let the rat escape.
1576450432221687808 2022-10-02 05:54:06 +0000 <naval> @ramanjokhakar Good line. Nation-scale virtue signaling.
1576450130617593857 2022-10-02 05:52:54 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko This is a very high risk strategy for Ukraine.   If Russia goes nuclear on them, the rest of the world will send thoughts and prayers and maybe some more conventional weapons that don‚Äôt matter anymore.  Better for everyone to negotiate a peace.
1576444025577426945 2022-10-02 05:28:39 +0000 <naval> @ChristiaNagel @aeyakovenko Anyway I don‚Äôt have to outline the exact peace deal to advocate for peace. That‚Äôs not a game theoretical prediction to make - it‚Äôs a matter of hidden preferences and BATNAs which is far more complex.
1576443765593559040 2022-10-02 05:27:37 +0000 <naval> @ChristiaNagel @aeyakovenko Nobody knows what both sides will actually go for. If I had to guess, we‚Äôd trade the Russian ethnic majority regions for Ukranian ethnic majority regions.   Ukraine would need to be rebuilt, rearmed, and put under a nuclear umbrella.
1576441989750366208 2022-10-02 05:20:33 +0000 <naval> @Andrei_Pavel_ When it‚Äôs rational to do so, yes.
1576441918870892544 2022-10-02 05:20:16 +0000 <naval> @ComplexDigi We have a defense treaty with Korea and troops on Korean soil. Different animal.
1576440601603497984 2022-10-02 05:15:02 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko I can‚Äôt predict the world 20 years out. It tends to get better. If you believe Peter Zeihan, Russian demographics mean this is their last war.   I do know that right now Putin has the stronger hand - he annexed those regions, is willing to use nukes, and Ukraine isn‚Äôt NATO.
1576439376229199872 2022-10-02 05:10:10 +0000 <naval> @sunnya97 @aeyakovenko Because now would be the time to tell the world, before they get hit.

1576433300708564992 2022-10-02 04:46:02 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko @ianlandsman In hindsight we should have given them Patriot batteries and the like when the Russians thought they were winning.
1576433027911077889 2022-10-02 04:44:57 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko @ianlandsman Maybe we could have gotten the Ukrainians to air superiority earlier but it‚Äôll now take too long and be too visible. Many of these bombers launch from Russian territory BTW.  Search Twitter for ‚Äústrategic bomber net‚Äù to see the history.
1576431488521805824 2022-10-02 04:38:50 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko @ianlandsman Pretty sure they can deliver large warheads from their strategic bomber fleet which has already successfully raided Ukraine multiple times.

1576429965624500225 2022-10-02 04:32:47 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko It‚Äôs not hard to hit some big bases and utility plants in cities. Who cares about HIMARs? The US bombed small cities in Japan. Putin isn‚Äôt above that.
1576429310440656898 2022-10-02 04:30:10 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko @ianlandsman Don‚Äôt assume they‚Äôll stick to the small stuff. ‚ÄúTactical‚Äù vs ‚ÄúStrategic‚Äù is just a colloquialism. They‚Äôll use whatever is effective.
1576428927232356353 2022-10-02 04:28:39 +0000 <naval> @Web3Spider That‚Äôs where this is actually headed, we just need to slow walk it.
1576428771887890432 2022-10-02 04:28:02 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko How many (the number, not the percentage) cruise missiles and large bombs have they landed to date? Now multiply each one by 1,000x to 10,000x (force).
1576428032067190784 2022-10-02 04:25:06 +0000 <naval> @frbrkoala This is true.
1576427969261670400 2022-10-02 04:24:51 +0000 <naval> @INVICTUS69X @denispinsky I think the administration has been walking this line carefully.
1576427801678254081 2022-10-02 04:24:11 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko @voinageo Then that‚Äôs the grim future we face. We will have to heavily militarize the far NATO outposts that we‚Äôve taken on.
1576427058644733954 2022-10-02 04:21:14 +0000 <naval> @ianlandsman @aeyakovenko Once they cross the Rubicon, they‚Äôll launch as many as they need to win.
1576426912108322817 2022-10-02 04:20:39 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko You have a lot more faith in defense systems than I do.   This age of hypersonic missiles, MLRS systems and drones really favors the attacker. It takes far, far more kinetic energy and intelligence to intercept a missile than it takes to land one.   And how many need to land?
1576426311878180865 2022-10-02 04:18:15 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko Not in time and Russia will just up the kind of nuke it uses. It‚Äôll be over within 5 days.
1576426079476031488 2022-10-02 04:17:20 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko @voinageo Same treaties that form NATO. Is that meaningless? NATO with a different name (lets Putin save face).
1576425278074605568 2022-10-02 04:14:09 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko This is a strong bluff on their part. I would guess that the Russians will see through it.
1576423920369954816 2022-10-02 04:08:45 +0000 <naval> @voinageo @aeyakovenko Ratified means the US would have treaty obligations a la NATO.
1576423369657831424 2022-10-02 04:06:34 +0000 <naval> @desewabbits @denispinsky That‚Äôs the correct take.
1576423195854262272 2022-10-02 04:05:53 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko I don‚Äôt think most military analysts would agree that a conventional Ukraine stands any chance against a nuclear Russia. Even if we could teleport missile defense systems over there.
1576422451923152897 2022-10-02 04:02:55 +0000 <naval> @Jon__Simpson NATO will break out the full toolbox of ineffective non-military responses.
1576422143058845696 2022-10-02 04:01:42 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko We can credibly stop him from invading anyone we have a ratified treaty with. That‚Äôs the red line.  The best answer for Ukraine is to make peace and be protected by a ratified treaty as part of that peace.
1576420074621005824 2022-10-02 03:53:28 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko Russia will have no problem delivering enough of its 2,000 tactical nukes to the frontline via artillery, cruise missiles, and bombers to crush any Ukrainian conventional force, no matter how well the latter is armed.
1576417852889829376 2022-10-02 03:44:39 +0000 <naval> @Mkc15144282M It is but I think he‚Äôs serious.

1576416457948217346 2022-10-02 03:39:06 +0000 <naval> @aeyakovenko Your unspoken assumption is that Ukraine armed with better conventional weapons stands a chance against Russians using nuclear weapons.   Is that true?

1576265148754296833 2022-10-01 17:37:51 +0000 <naval> @4cchild None of that will happen. The UN has no power to coerce Russia in any way. A no fly zone will be met with a nuclear response from Russia.

1576264271662436353 2022-10-01 17:34:22 +0000 <naval> @ctindale Who needs the win here more badly? Russia or the US? Ukraine isn‚Äôt nuclear armed.
1576263237019922432 2022-10-01 17:30:15 +0000 <naval> @unserioso Correct. One way or another, I suspect that this war will set off an era of mass proliferation.
1576262455855960064 2022-10-01 17:27:09 +0000 <naval> @unserioso Would have to be done extremely quietly or it would trigger a nuclear confrontation. And the ostensible retaliation is that Russia and China would then slip nukes to Iran, Syria, Belarus, etc. Mass proliferation.

Anyway, hard to discuss in the abstract. I leave things at the aphorism level so that one can just remember the observation and contextually apply as relevant to their specific situation.
1572634511791521792 2022-09-21 17:11:00 +0000 <naval> @moskov @DanielleFong The point is the sprint / rest pattern, not any precise number of hours.

1476758813713657858 2021-12-31 03:35:12 +0000 <naval> @adamdangelo @levie @LukeYoungblood I suspect the modern versions are more performant and will iterate quite a bit faster. There is definitely still increased onboarding friction but not a lot.

1476739879987924993 2021-12-31 02:19:58 +0000 <naval> @adamdangelo @levie @LukeYoungblood I never encountered it. Was it possible to build a performant and featured decentralized social network back then or were there severe tradeoffs? The spec was also unstable back then.  That said, I don‚Äôt think blockchains replace existing apps. They have to find native use cases.
1476737776330555393 2021-12-31 02:11:36 +0000 <naval> @kevingibbon @levie Not in my experience. Yes you can always build a big company later, but early and right when others are absent or wrong is where most fortunes are made.

1476706278852366359 2021-12-31 00:06:27 +0000 <naval> @levie You can come back when these are all solved (and they are solvable and will be solved) but by then the big economic upside will be gone. That‚Äôs the trade.
1476705945266786319 2021-12-31 00:05:07 +0000 <naval> @levie Same as when a company underprices a product early on to bootstrap a network.
1476705600868290589 2021-12-31 00:03:45 +0000 <naval> @levie Seems easily solved. Companies have fluctuating market caps but still stable prices. Smart designs can decouple the two at least for short term stability.
1476705079071629313 2021-12-31 00:01:41 +0000 <naval> @levie It‚Äôs not ‚Äúusers become owners,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúcontributors become owners.‚Äù And companies always build for customers (unless they‚Äôre monopolies). I don‚Äôt see any new tension.
1476703919480868872 2021-12-30 23:57:04 +0000 <naval> @levie @LukeYoungblood I don‚Äôt see why it can‚Äôt. I see no theoretical show stoppers other than existing network effects. Which are formidable but not technical.
1476703643277533184 2021-12-30 23:55:59 +0000 <naval> @hc_zzzzz @levie @LukeYoungblood It‚Äôs not literally porting the graph.

1476702359900196866 2021-12-30 23:50:53 +0000 <naval> @davidsarac True. Perhaps it has to do with an innate ability to recognize beneficially complex systems. Complex systems (‚Äúliving‚Äù) encode much more computation than simple ones (‚Äúdead‚Äù) and we find the ones that help our survival or replication to be ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù  But maybe overthinking it.
1476699889870409730 2021-12-30 23:41:04 +0000 <naval> @davidsarac Interesting. So it‚Äôs a first-order perception, not something to be explained by reason or emotion?  Is this in ‚ÄúA Timeless Way of Building?‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember it from ‚ÄúA Pattern Language.‚Äù

1476694732537401344 2021-12-30 23:20:34 +0000 <naval> @metapital_andre I suspect it‚Äôs closer to inevitable than merely possible.

1420847539926933504 2021-07-29 20:43:46 +0000 <naval> @lpolovets Put another way, as OSS, AWS, and all of the last generation of tools rolled out, did the demand for engineers in a given company decline or increase?  As engineers become more leveraged and the returns to engineering go up, do you want less engineers or more engineers?
1420846670850322434 2021-07-29 20:40:19 +0000 <naval> @lpolovets Good teams will use no-code but any advantage just becomes table stakes.  No-code ends up in the non-tech part of the tech company.  Highest leverage part of the company develops new and difficult tech.  The engineer shortage will continue to worsen even as no-code tools improve.

1412935100648497154 2021-07-08 00:42:33 +0000 <naval> Pain avoidance leads to pivots when one would be better off shutting down the failed project and launching a fresh one.
1412935030758727688 2021-07-08 00:42:17 +0000 <naval> In the same manner, a good product is not a compromise between two products.  Good cap tables, founding teams, and customer bases are not compromises between the needs of two different companies.
1412934911615389697 2021-07-08 00:41:48 +0000 <naval> A good explanation is a self-contained creative leap, and not a compromise between two different explanations.   It‚Äôs hard to vary the details of a good explanation without a complete loss of explanatory power.
1412934837770416130 2021-07-08 00:41:31 +0000 <naval> To pivot is to turn while keeping one foot in place.  But a correct theory is a good explanation of how the world works.

1379156813342330881 2021-04-05 19:39:42 +0000 <naval> There is far more speculative investment money in crypto than there is in traditional venture capital.

1378956447619325952 2021-04-05 06:23:31 +0000 <naval> Public blockchains will be the title registries for everything of value.   Ultimately, NFTs will authenticate the world.**
1378956359874478082 2021-04-05 06:23:10 +0000 <naval> NFTs tokenize all the things.   We are going from a world where every protocol has a token, to where every (decentralized) application has a token, to where every valuable digital representation of an object or person has a token.
1378956235551072257 2021-04-05 06:22:40 +0000 <naval> With NFTs, blockchains make the jump from finance into creative applications.   Regulators would do well to recognize that blockchains are the next generation of the Internet, and applying financial regulations to NFTs is a category error.
1378956162406572039 2021-04-05 06:22:23 +0000 <naval> As with most art and most tokens, most NFTs will have very little value.   But a select few NFTs will become focal points for communities who gather to celebrate art, build collections, and explore virtual worlds.
1378956012653142027 2021-04-05 06:21:47 +0000 <naval> Just as there are those who won‚Äôt accept that mere consensus can create digital gold, and those who won‚Äôt accept that mere smart contracts can create a decentralized Wall Street, there are those that won‚Äôt accept that digitized social contracts will create valuable tokens.
1378955935935123458 2021-04-05 06:21:29 +0000 <naval> Even ‚Äúactual-value NFTs‚Äù require a social contract with the creator and community to transfer the value from the off-chain contracts onto the chain where the NFT is registered.
1378955879945363460 2021-04-05 06:21:16 +0000 <naval> ‚ÄúActual-value NFTs‚Äù can draw upon legal and code-based contracts - a song token can provide a royalty stream, a ticket token can provide access, a metaverse token can grant land titles, an item token can have in-game powers, an ISA token can provide a cut of creator earnings.
1378955787171602432 2021-04-05 06:20:54 +0000 <naval> If the community around an NFT is dying, the NFT is likely bleeding value.   If the community is surging, the NFT is likely gaining value.   NFTs are monetized memes.*
1378955377396477954 2021-04-05 06:19:16 +0000 <naval> For NFTs representing digital art and collectibles, the creator cannot enforce scarcity - it‚Äôs up to a surrounding community to imbue the authorized NFT with scarcity and prestige within the context of that community.
1378955233028571137 2021-04-05 06:18:41 +0000 <naval> An NFT‚Äôs creator may break their promise, or be unable to enforce it, or may have picked the wrong underlying platform and community - rendering the NFT worthless.
1378955134416261126 2021-04-05 06:18:18 +0000 <naval> Off-chain assets represented by NFTs are not provably scarce.   The promise of scarcity is a slender thread, only as strong as the social contract with the creator and interwoven with the backing of the community.
1378954966199541767 2021-04-05 06:17:38 +0000 <naval> By assigning a unique token to a thing, its ownership (not the thing itself!) becomes programmable, verifiable, divisible, durable, universally addressable, composable, digitally secured, and easy to transfer.
1378954897295515650 2021-04-05 06:17:21 +0000 <naval> An NFT is a unique, on-chain token representing ownership of an off-chain asset.   The token is backed by a social contract from its creator and a surrounding community.

1378916873589288960 2021-04-05 03:46:16 +0000 <naval> On the web, every page has a unique address and any other page can link to it.  On public blockchains, every application has a unique address, and any other paying application can incorporate it.  The future is a network of permissionlessly composable and secure applications.

1305793381130403840 2020-09-15 08:59:37 +0000 <naval> @stp_ip @tylertringas It's not standard with traditional funds, but seems to be the trend with the current rolling funds. Possibly because the leads have day jobs and don't need salaries, AL handles all of the backoffice already, and they want more upside.
1305788958379368448 2020-09-15 08:42:02 +0000 <naval> @stp_ip @tylertringas Not quite. Traditional funds gather 2% per year on *committed capital* for ten years. Rolling funds gather 2% per year on *collected capital,* which is much smaller than committed capital early on. The 4 year collection mitigates that and brings them back towards equivalence.

1292637466256523266 2020-08-10 01:42:42 +0000 <naval> @stevegraham @caitlinbolnick1 @CindyBiSV I think you‚Äôre confused. Syndicates and rolling funds are two entirely different things. But probably not a conversation for Twitter.
1292565612598722560 2020-08-09 20:57:11 +0000 <naval> @stevegraham You may be curious about LPs,  and you can and should ask any GP investing - who are your LPs, how much information do they get, can they help or hurt, is there Chinese or Russian or Saudi or whatever money? Rolling or not, each fund has their own policies and answers.
1292565208121057280 2020-08-09 20:55:34 +0000 <naval> @stevegraham With all due respect, that's a misunderstanding. A rolling fund is a SaaS structure for a VC or seed fund to manage their ops. No impact on you as a founder. The "product" that you buy is GP involvement &amp; $$, which are the same regardless of open and rolling or closed and fixed.
1292564089936330752 2020-08-09 20:51:08 +0000 <naval> @tomylorsch @CindyBiSV Then the LP just cancels their subscription for the next quarter. The right to exit solves many issues by default.

1291981914803326976 2020-08-08 06:17:47 +0000 <naval> @lpolovets @shl SAFE counts for (1), specifically designed as such.  For (2) SAFE can be paired with vanilla conversion terms.  On (3) SAFE is still cheaper.  But Series Seed has more investor protections.  And SAFE is a full-ratchet until conversion for entrepreneurs.

But you can set it to yes, committed, and cancel their stake if you want to mimic a traditional fund.  A rolling fund is a set of atomized SPVs with a virtual crossed carry layer on top. The rest is software.

1263375415038509056 2020-05-21 07:45:45 +0000 <naval> Political correctness makes speech itself political, and so everything becomes political.

1263326787251007488 2020-05-21 04:32:32 +0000 <naval> @eladgil @Austen I agree that‚Äôs the solution (along with not hiring political people in the first place). But it‚Äôs very difficult in practice so most companies end up politicized.
1263325999929757696 2020-05-21 04:29:24 +0000 <naval> @eladgil @Austen The founder would have to enforce it as agents get politicized. And the first enforcement action brings a mob to the door.

1263006797700280320 2020-05-20 07:21:00 +0000 <naval> A true atheist knows that nothing ultimately matters and lives a relatively carefree life.   A true believer knows that it‚Äôs all in God‚Äôs hands and lives a relatively carefree life.   Lot of agnostics out there.

1262951127433252873 2020-05-20 03:39:47 +0000 <naval> @BhandariSayujya It‚Äôs possible that depriving the neocortex of stimulation shuts down the Default Mode Network and reverts the brain to a (not necessarily negative) animal / child resting state.  So it might be vestigial, not adaptive.
1262945078038806528 2020-05-20 03:15:45 +0000 <naval> @Marklaroche12 @akirathedon It‚Äôs not a podcast if you have to go to Spotify to hear it. Hijacking the brand. Like AOL used to claim it was the web.

1262896310509862914 2020-05-20 00:01:58 +0000 <naval> @akirathedon Spotify is trying to create a one way road into Spotify and take over podcasting.

1261484161501552641 2020-05-16 02:30:36 +0000 <naval> The ability to be content and at peace, by yourself, is freedom.

1261483795619786752 2020-05-16 02:29:08 +0000 <naval> You cannot fail at meditation.
1261483675096498176 2020-05-16 02:28:40 +0000 <naval> There is nothing to say and nothing on offer. No one is taking you anywhere, selling you anything, or making you promises. Reading or talking about meditation will do nothing for you.
1261483595513782274 2020-05-16 02:28:21 +0000 <naval> The point of meditation is not to become "a meditator" - in reality, there's no such thing. If it doesn‚Äôt bring lasting and effortless change, drop it, before it becomes another struggle and another chase.
1261483390110322689 2020-05-16 02:27:32 +0000 <naval> Meditation is a single player game. There is no point in comparing to other meditators or to even your own previous meditations.
1261483242114347008 2020-05-16 02:26:56 +0000 <naval> There's no need to get up to record a thought. If the idea was good, it‚Äôll come back. If it doesn‚Äôt come back, it wasn‚Äôt that good.
1261483097557618688 2020-05-16 02:26:22 +0000 <naval> There are many meditation methods, but "no effort" is the universal method. Every creature at all times can choose to do nothing.
1261482876228341760 2020-05-16 02:25:29 +0000 <naval> No focus, no mantra, no dharma, no chakras, no Buddhas, no gurus, no gratitude, no scripture, no temple, no music, no gadgets, no apps are required.   Some may be helpful, but eventually all will have to be left behind. Start simply, because that's where this all ends.
1261482733848543232 2020-05-16 02:24:55 +0000 <naval> Meditation isn‚Äôt holy or spiritual or magical. It‚Äôs literally nothing.
1261482575794589702 2020-05-16 02:24:17 +0000 <naval> Meditation is not going through thoughts but rather letting thoughts go through you.  The thought ‚ÄúI am meditating‚Äù is also a thought.
1261482439622287360 2020-05-16 02:23:45 +0000 <naval> Make no effort for or against anything.   Whatever happens, happens.   Surrender to yourself in the moment.   Resist nothing and reject nothing, including the urge to resist and reject.
1261482300404973569 2020-05-16 02:23:12 +0000 <naval> Realize that at this moment, you are the only person in the world and there is no one to instruct you, praise you, or judge you.
1261482182469513216 2020-05-16 02:22:44 +0000 <naval> Sixty minutes are easier than thirty, as it takes time for the mind to settle down.  Sixty consecutive days are needed, just as it takes time for the body to go from unfit to fit.
1261482105281769472 2020-05-16 02:22:25 +0000 <naval> Prepare for meditation by sitting quietly in the morning, with eyes closed and back upright, in any comfortable position that will minimize movement.
1261481940101689344 2020-05-16 02:21:46 +0000 <naval> Just as the sky rains when the clouds are heavy, and the body sleeps when the limbs are tired, meditation arrives when the mind is calm.
1261481815623168000 2020-05-16 02:21:16 +0000 <naval> Just as the sky rains when the clouds are heavy, and the body sleeps when the limbs are tired, meditation arrives when the mind is calm.
1261481752448524289 2020-05-16 02:21:01 +0000 <naval> In an age of mental gluttony, meditation is fasting for the mind.  Before paying a therapist to listen to you, listen to yourself.  Before clearing your inbox, clear your mind.
1261481489650167808 2020-05-16 02:19:58 +0000 <naval> ‚ÄúNo technique of the mind will free you from the mind.‚Äù
1261481397992079362 2020-05-16 02:19:37 +0000 <naval> We say that we want peace of mind but what we really want is peace from mind.
1261481329062899713 2020-05-16 02:19:20 +0000 <naval> Meditation is your birthright. It's your natural state.  It requires no one, needs no thing, and has no technique.  If something requires a guru, a mantra, or a teaching, it isn't universal, and it won't free you.

Non-dual philosophy gets past this by saying that Brahman is all, and creates the illusion of Maya to forget itself.   This seems to be the appropriate solution for a dualistic God, one who is eternal yet not omniscient &amp; omnipotent, and stands apart from its creation.

1254554444286451712 2020-04-26 23:34:22 +0000 <naval> @bmcclendon @mghmiguel Ha. I mean if the asymptomatic carrier rate is 13x the current tested rate, then the number of tests required skyrockets. And the number of traces does too.  You‚Äôre approaching the Paul Romer plan. Could work but we are so, so far from that level of testing and cost per test.
1254552463161483264 2020-04-26 23:26:30 +0000 <naval> @NeerajT4 Yes. Use your common sense to solve it. It‚Äôs not insolvable.

1252300723032715264 2020-04-20 18:18:53 +0000 <naval> Deaths are much lower than modeled.   Either this disease is more easily spread (higher R) and less fatal (lower IFR)...  ...or social distancing has worked.  Calibrated, wide-scale serology tests are needed ASAP.  It‚Äôs a multi-Trillion dollar question.

1252217995289432065 2020-04-20 12:50:09 +0000 <naval> @bmcclendon No, I think it‚Äôs more likely the NYC IFR is higher but it could be 0.5% in NYC for NYC specific reasons and 1/4 is infected. Herd immunity for more virulent would be at 75%+. So 1/3 of the way there.
1252214923565821955 2020-04-20 12:37:57 +0000 <naval> @bmcclendon 10K dead in NYC and half the population infected bounds the IFR at 0.25%. Possible it‚Äôs higher in NYC by 2x over Palo Alto, Denmark, etc.

1252197513139859456 2020-04-20 11:28:46 +0000 <naval> @paul_btc That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd thought - why are there hotspots? But even these IFRs indicate some room for that. I.e., at an IFR of 0.2% and a population of 20M, NYC could have 10K deaths once a quarter of the population is infected.
1252195963747237891 2020-04-20 11:22:37 +0000 <naval> To be fair, all serology tests, if biased, would bias the same way. When the actual percent infected is low and population samples are small, false positives will have an outsized impact compared to false negatives. But none of these shows less than a 10x undercount.
1252193141005840385 2020-04-20 11:11:24 +0000 <naval> @EcoMathLife @ScottAdamsSays By much, much less.
1252186256739405824 2020-04-20 10:44:02 +0000 <naval> We are still very far from herd immunity.  And because it‚Äôs novel, it can still overwhelm the hospital system.

1252051327770718208 2020-04-20 01:47:53 +0000 <naval> @jhong Most experts believe that's the case.

1241422215473532928 2020-03-21 17:51:35 +0000 <naval> Flattening curve alone not enough. 50% infected x 12% hospitalized overwhelms, even if spread over 18 mo.

The other Coronaviruses all display seasonality. In any case, it would lower the R0. The question is, for a brand new disease with no herd immunity - how much?
1238302207331561473 2020-03-13 03:13:47 +0000 <naval> @paultrotter1 False. Read the beginning of the thread. Because there is significant transmission from asymptomatic carriers, everyone should when in a densely populated place.

1238177372211273728 2020-03-12 18:57:44 +0000 <naval> Studies show asymptomatic carriers spread the virus.  Everyone should wear masks (and distance, wash hands).

1237821304255827968 2020-03-11 19:22:51 +0000 <naval> @j_rankin1 For the group, yes. If everyone wears masks, the carriers are less likely to spread it.

1237819508984672256 2020-03-11 19:15:43 +0000 <naval> Current market panic feels overblown. This is a short-term shock.

1235842334056562689 2020-03-06 08:19:07 +0000 <naval> [41:00] Many cases are clinically indistinguishable from the common cold or the flu. It‚Äôs not really containable in any country, that‚Äôs a temporary illusion.  [43:25] In temperate zones, coronaviruses display seasonality. In tropical areas, no seasonality for respiratory viruses.
1235842021845127170 2020-03-06 08:17:53 +0000 <naval> [38:30] mRNA vaccines like the Moderna vaccines can go into trials very quickly. Many, many vaccine candidates.  [40:00] Coronaviruses tend to be stable against mutation (for RNA viruses). There‚Äôs no selection pressure to mutate right now and this is spreading easily.
1235841867423465473 2020-03-06 08:17:16 +0000 <naval> [35:20] More likely undiagnosed cases than fatalities. 1%-2% fatality rate too high. Discrepancy between Wuhan and non-Wuhan cases. Health care interventions and ICU quality matter.  [37:00] Incubation average is 6 days, but up to 14 possible.
1235841753816563712 2020-03-06 08:16:49 +0000 <naval> [27:50] This is not containable. Don‚Äôt quarantine or panic. Become personally resilient. Make the healthcare system resilient.  [33:00] Containment will inevitably fail and doesn‚Äôt buy much time.  [34:00] Wearing an N95 mask can‚Äôt be sustained for long. Wear only if sick.

1233517683418783746 2020-02-28 22:21:48 +0000 <naval> @achill638 My current best guess, completely subject to change tomorrow:   The first wave causes panic but warmer weather hopefully mitigates it.   Second wave much worse - Starts in November with a much larger base of infected, and ramps over 5 months rather than 2 months.

1233507549523124224 2020-02-28 21:41:31 +0000 <naval> It‚Äôll be interesting to track effects of heat and humidity on Coronavirus.   Presumably it‚Äôll lower the R0, but by how much? There has been spread in Singapore and Malaysia, but both seem contained and one has to disambiguate indoor AC-heavy environments from outdoor ones.

1216344829841436672 2020-01-12 13:03:00 +0000 <naval> @ShettyNiranjan After, but originally, hatha yoga was preparation for meditation. So quiet, solo pranayama and yoga would go prior.

1211172270082641921 2019-12-29 06:29:06 +0000 <naval> @andrewchen The fact that people need economists to tell us this is sad.

1158176042797821952 2019-08-05 00:41:01 +0000 <naval> @awertheim Not true. Many private investments are close to non-accrediteds because of onerous rules and limits.
1158175328860164096 2019-08-05 00:38:10 +0000 <naval> @mwilcox A naive first cut: N% of your net worth every year for every year in which you've made a private investment. Cap lifts after 10 years experience. So for example, in year 5, you can invest 5% of your net worth in year 5.   There are other schemes...

1158173492233175040 2019-08-05 00:30:53 +0000 <naval> Investing well is a skill that everyone can and should learn.  Accreditation rules prevent learning and push people into a small set of "safe" assets, high-priced managers, and into lotteries / gambling.  Rules based on sophistication instead of net worth would lower inequality.

1141027341704892418 2019-06-18 16:58:12 +0000 <naval> The countervailing force is that drones dramatically lower the cost to assassinating heads of state.  Which is why politicians won‚Äôt allows drones to fall under the Second Amendment, with terrorism and crime as the pretext.

If I‚Äôm a merchant and I can keep my traditional PoS and pay 2.x% and deal with fraud, or I can use an iPad, eliminate fraud, and pay 0.x% on every transaction, I‚Äôll switch immediately to the iPad. $V and $MA get crushed down.
1123764905092550656 2019-05-02 01:43:26 +0000 <naval> @JudgeMiller @markallan33 Consumer prefers it too as they get 2% cash back on all purchases with no annual fee. Saving 2% and eliminating fraud for merchants means Apple and Google have a lot of largesse to spread around.
1123763147737841665 2019-05-02 01:36:27 +0000 <naval> @JudgeMiller @markallan33 Because eliminating fraud frees up much of the 2.x% in costs and merchant fraud drastically go down. Merchants will push the fraud-free solution and Apple will refund 2% cash-back. Pure economics will drive it.

I.e., in 2+2=4 neither 2 contains the number 4 but the ‚Äò+‚Äô operator contains an algorithm which carries a lot of information and means that ‚Äò2+2‚Äô does contain 4.

1103267549616062464 2019-03-06 12:14:16 +0000 <naval> @jordanmoore It would work if Twitter was engineered as a platform rather than as a media company.
1103265599960956929 2019-03-06 12:06:31 +0000 <naval> @jordanmoore You‚Äôd have to trust Twitter to not out you under pressure, and to protect it even internally from their employees. Tall order.

1100254333722157058 2019-02-26 04:40:49 +0000 <naval> Samskara, by @Android_Jones is the most powerful work of visual art I‚Äôve ever seen.
1100131900197298189 2019-02-25 20:34:19 +0000 <naval> @oflarsa It happens because an intolerant and numerous minority of coworkers, partners, and customers forces the issue.

1099907348707995648 2019-02-25 05:42:01 +0000 <naval> @lsanger New apps for new use cases, the old ones are gone unless a platform truly stumbles.  Re: APIs, they don‚Äôt have to cut off anything, they just stop updating them with new features and extensions. It‚Äôs really easy for an API provider to subtly choke off a developer.
1099875228866363393 2019-02-25 03:34:23 +0000 <naval> @DreDurr No, in that case I‚Äôd put quotes around it.

1099873464402333697 2019-02-25 03:27:23 +0000 <naval> @thefatbitcoin @TheChuChu_ Update. I‚Äôm going back to my old method, which is more promiscuous.   The problem is that Twitter only has ‚Äúlike‚Äù and nothing for ‚Äúread receipt,‚Äù ‚ÄúI agree,‚Äù ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù and for invoking their own ‚Äúprobabilistic retweet‚Äù functionality.
1099793079404384256 2019-02-24 22:07:57 +0000 <naval> @johnhanacek Is there a single, simple way to read all of your stories? RSS, a PDF download, or a book to purchase?
1099790641645547520 2019-02-24 21:58:16 +0000 <naval> @pavtalk Agreed.
1099788902477443072 2019-02-24 21:51:22 +0000 <naval> @lsanger Are the APIs open enough? Even if they are now, they‚Äôll get locked down. IMHO the best avenue here is creating the infrastructure for new, simple apps, not trying to displace the existing ones.

1099781002577072128 2019-02-24 21:19:58 +0000 <naval> Unfortunately, the popularity of mobile means the bootstrap strategy (#4) likely won‚Äôt work.

1099564826404085760 2019-02-24 07:00:58 +0000 <naval> You have to surrender, at least a little bit, to be the best version of yourself possible.

1099475317117181953 2019-02-24 01:05:17 +0000 <naval> Digital privacy is more important than ever, because as it goes, so does the freedom to speak.
1099475235621941251 2019-02-24 01:04:58 +0000 <naval> On the distant horizon are trustless, decentralized, and easy-to-use blockchain-based social apps. They can't break existing network effects, but they can wait for a platform to stumble.
1099475145691848705 2019-02-24 01:04:36 +0000 <naval> Oblivious platforms will remain heavy handed and eventually be regulated and nationalized once they are properly classified as information monopolies.
1099475091144900608 2019-02-24 01:04:23 +0000 <naval> The smart social media platforms will hand the tools to the people or hide them behind inscrutable algorithms. Publish / subscribe of spam and block lists can clean up discussions in a decentralized way.
1099475012044484609 2019-02-24 01:04:04 +0000 <naval> Once a social media platform demonstrates its true power, its days as a free entity are numbered. If a platform has the power to appoint rulers, then the platform's rulers must be appointed.
1099474932260495360 2019-02-24 01:03:45 +0000 <naval> The people designing the algorithms to shape online debate are now the most powerful people in the world.
1099474882373382144 2019-02-24 01:03:33 +0000 <naval> The social media platforms themselves live in fear and have begun to wield the heavy hand of censorship to placate the digital mob.
1099474835523100672 2019-02-24 01:03:22 +0000 <naval> The best accounts on social media are anonymous. The worst accounts on social media are anonymous.
1099474782708355072 2019-02-24 01:03:10 +0000 <naval> The best defense against a digital mob is to avoid being targeted. Most people will keep their heads down, a brave few will speak out, but honesty now hides behind anonymity.
1099474715490410496 2019-02-24 01:02:54 +0000 <naval> Loyal members of digital mobs are so oblivious that they don't even see the problem, as long as they're on the winning side.
1099474660230479878 2019-02-24 01:02:40 +0000 <naval> Armchair generals can make a living and gain social status inciting digital mobs, sometimes even as members of the media.
1099474604010029056 2019-02-24 01:02:27 +0000 <naval> Today there is no cost to joining a digital mob. Over time, there will be tools that identify and expose the easily and perpetually outraged.
1099474515388555269 2019-02-24 01:02:06 +0000 <naval> Every successful digital mob strike narrows the Overton Window, softly suffocating speech online.
1099474460418048000 2019-02-24 01:01:53 +0000 <naval> Digital mobs are implacable, unaccountable, and leaderless. Targets are isolated and torn apart by an intolerant and numerous minority, with no single participant responsible for the killing blow.
1099474375177191424 2019-02-24 01:01:32 +0000 <naval> Social media makes it easier to organize people, so the motivated people are organizing digital mobs.  Thread:

1090401225328058374 2019-01-30 00:08:05 +0000 <naval> @wheatpond @lwsnbaker Right. But it won‚Äôt be a security token because it‚Äôs fully decentralized. It‚Äôll run as a smart contract on top of decentralized chains and use decentralized oracles.
1090399475162435589 2019-01-30 00:01:08 +0000 <naval> @omarajame It‚Äôs easier to do all of that with APIs and publishing, without running a blockchain. Blockchains are incredibly complex and expensive to build, operate, and secure.
1090396820843286528 2019-01-29 23:50:35 +0000 <naval> @ianlapham Bitcoin, BitTorrent, TCP/IP are close enough. And the trendline for many other projects is in that direction.
1090396520375959553 2019-01-29 23:49:23 +0000 <naval> @omarajame Even then. You can sign hashes of data and backup to AWS. Much easier.
1090395440615350273 2019-01-29 23:45:06 +0000 <naval> If it‚Äôs not going to be completely and utterly decentralized, it doesn‚Äôt need a blockchain.
1090393943794012160 2019-01-29 23:39:09 +0000 <naval> @masonic_tweets @L1AD That‚Äôs the reason to follow securities laws, not the reason to bolt on a blockchain.
1090393625844838400 2019-01-29 23:37:53 +0000 <naval> @lwsnbaker But in that case, why trade them as securities? They‚Äôll just trade on Binance and DEXes and be custodied like any ERC-20 token. These are ‚Äúsecurities in name only.‚Äù
1090392586622103552 2019-01-29 23:33:45 +0000 <naval> @lwsnbaker @wheatpond If it‚Äôs centralized &amp; a security, then there‚Äôs no point to a bearer token.   If it‚Äôs partially decentralized &amp; a security, then the issuer will be held liable as if it were a security and there‚Äôs no point to a bearer token.  If it‚Äôs fully decentralized, it‚Äôs not a security token.
1090391296282218496 2019-01-29 23:28:38 +0000 <naval> @L1AD @masonic_tweets Agreed at the moment, but I‚Äôm really trying to understand this. If there really is a use case for security tokens, I want to know what it is. I can‚Äôt find it, so far.
1090390914810277889 2019-01-29 23:27:07 +0000 <naval> @AlecZiupsnys @lwsnbaker Immutability of a pointer is irrelevant. Transparency doesn‚Äôt need a blockchain.
1090390664083206144 2019-01-29 23:26:07 +0000 <naval> @lwsnbaker To simplify, I suspect that in practice, issuing bearer security tokens creates nearly unlimited liability for the issuer and the facilitator as existing securities law comes into conflict with the notion of a bearer asset.
1090390244321447936 2019-01-29 23:24:27 +0000 <naval> @lwsnbaker Suppose that Issuer I sells a bearer security token to Buyer B using Facilitator F. Due to a bug in I‚Äôs blockchain, B loses the token. Later, a court finds I in violation of securities law and grants B the right of recission. Will the court let I and F off the hook?
1090388691514646529 2019-01-29 23:18:17 +0000 <naval> @Cypherm0nk @masonic_tweets Doesn‚Äôt need a blockchain, use a database.
1090388513038622720 2019-01-29 23:17:34 +0000 <naval> @BrennanGeis @lwsnbaker No. A court can and will reverse the ownership in compliance with local laws.
1090387899407785984 2019-01-29 23:15:08 +0000 <naval> @masonic_tweets I asked an honest question hoping for an honest answer, as I‚Äôm looking to understand.
1090385754868469760 2019-01-29 23:06:37 +0000 <naval> @lwsnbaker Interesting use case. Will regulators allow securities as true bearer assets? Is there any such thing around today?
1090379321775054848 2019-01-29 22:41:03 +0000 <naval> @lwsnbaker I get the use case for decentralized coins but why does it matter at all for security tokens? Those are pointers to real assets and not bearer instruments. Stealing the deed to a house doesn‚Äôt give you possession of the house.

Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit.

1042577224832974848 2018-09-20 00:52:35 +0000 <naval> It's about authority vs. liberty.   The distinction amongst authoritarians (facism, communism, etc.) is window dressing.
1041724218205855744 2018-09-17 16:23:02 +0000 <naval> @sardamit I do, sorry. Don't want to make this about money.

1041430693471899649 2018-09-16 20:56:40 +0000 <naval> @fatehsmann I enjoy learning and non-fiction generally has higher information density / learning curve. I do enjoy science fiction and graphic novels. It‚Äôs not some grand plan - just read whatever you like.
1041030210278191104 2018-09-15 18:25:18 +0000 <naval> @aatif_awan @TaylorPearsonMe Like all words, it can mean a lot of things, but I‚Äôm talking about the raw, visceral hotheaded anger that acts as a costly and credible signal, and you often regret later.   Anger at yourself is just a game.
1041002479498944512 2018-09-15 16:35:06 +0000 <naval> @michael_nielsen @Altimor Interesting. Not being English, I missed the Thatcher digs but I think you‚Äôre right. Agreed it destroys timelessness.

1041000179082510336 2018-09-15 16:25:58 +0000 <naval> @TaylorPearsonMe Disgust = potential for disease  Love = my genes are or should be carried by this person  Lust = high mate value  Anger = Loss of control to another human  Jealousy = danger of losing mate investment  Envy = measuring and setting new target in current status hierarchy  etc...
1040865350328307712 2018-09-15 07:30:12 +0000 <naval> @michael_nielsen @Altimor Disagree. In the comic, V is just a person (could‚Äôve been anyone), but in the movie V is a superhero (distant). The movie is anti-fascist and couldn‚Äôt help taking digs at George Bush. The comic was pro-anarchist and more timeless. Moore was right, they mangled it.
1040776576554561537 2018-09-15 01:37:27 +0000 <naval> @0x49fa98 Or, Scott Alexander realizes that most of his really smart friends are to the right of him.  *cue cognitive dissonance.*  ‚ÄúIt must be fashion!‚Äù

1040640403907567616 2018-09-14 16:36:21 +0000 <naval> @JonB0t @normonics Good one. But do we need elegant here? Another word too similar to beauty.
1040639901669064704 2018-09-14 16:34:21 +0000 <naval> @mindless1729 If I were, I would go back.
1040639532465512448 2018-09-14 16:32:53 +0000 <naval> @guygal @normonics Problem with that definition (lives longer than me or it lives shorter than me) is that it applies to everything.
1040638956654682112 2018-09-14 16:30:36 +0000 <naval> @johndurant @normonics May be sneaking beauty back in by using the word form. Or perhaps this is an efficiency argument - best encoded solution.
1040638360484687872 2018-09-14 16:28:13 +0000 <naval> @FerraraKev @normonics Also needs a concept of usefulness. An anteater can appreciate the inherent order in an ant‚Äôs nest like no other.
1040637697415569409 2018-09-14 16:25:35 +0000 <naval> @FerraraKev @normonics Good one. Shorter than mine but trying to say the same thing. Although using the word ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù may be cheating.
1040635725174067200 2018-09-14 16:17:45 +0000 <naval> On beauty:
1040635578859966464 2018-09-14 16:17:10 +0000 <naval> @normonics Love it.
1040634680289050624 2018-09-14 16:13:36 +0000 <naval> @normonics Beauty is the beholder‚Äôs evolved perception of the measure of ‚Äúuseful‚Äù complexity in a system.

1039917877464162304 2018-09-12 16:45:17 +0000 <naval> @david_perell The Wikipedia entry is hand summarized. A computer can‚Äôt do that without grave error.  If an author writes a book that can be shortened and make the same point, they should just write a shorter book in the first place.

1039020969182941189 2018-09-10 05:21:17 +0000 <naval> @theanmolverma A low-grade simmering anger which will boil your mind. Doesn‚Äôt mean you can discard it, just notice the damage that it does. Ultimately we forgive for ourselves, not for others.

1038950129124790272 2018-09-10 00:39:48 +0000 <naval> @Charlie_Hustle_ Yes, but I was thinking more of Modafinil and its successors.

1033856420649652224 2018-08-26 23:19:13 +0000 <naval> Investors have different incentives than founders.   What investors often look for in a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù founder is irrational behavior that the investor doesn‚Äôt engage in themselves.   I.e., 80-hour weeks for 10 years, passing up a big acquisition to go for broke, zero diversification.
1033594019463356416 2018-08-26 05:56:32 +0000 <naval> The difference between investing early into a company and investing early into a protocol is that companies die when they run out of cash, but protocols die when they run out of believers.

1025378423730884608 2018-08-03 13:50:41 +0000 <naval> @semil Wonder how many FinTech funds actually invested in crypto...
1025368332021559297 2018-08-03 13:10:35 +0000 <naval> Twitter is online society. To survive it, the individual must ignore the news, leave the mobs, disassociate from the angry and the confused, and dismiss both compliments and insults.
1025368330884931584 2018-08-03 13:10:35 +0000 <naval> Twitter is a microphone. It makes instant celebrities of each of us, with retweet fame and follower fans. Celebrities may be the unhappiest people in the world.
1025368329932816385 2018-08-03 13:10:34 +0000 <naval> Twitter is a network. It connects people based on their ideas rather than on their pre-existing relationships.
1025368328691302400 2018-08-03 13:10:34 +0000 <naval> Twitter is a school. The most spiritual, scientific, and literary minds on the planet freely share their distilled works. And every fool shouts over them.
1025368326816460801 2018-08-03 13:10:34 +0000 <naval> Twitter is a mob. A mob of angry and confused people, who destroy targets with no individual feeling responsibility for the killing blow.
1025368325642022913 2018-08-03 13:10:33 +0000 <naval> Twitter is a newsroom. Breaking news is one imagined emergency after another, from around the world, delivered to your unprepared brain.
1019845475938324480 2018-07-19 07:24:43 +0000 <naval> Every discussion should work like this.
1019845049842974720 2018-07-19 07:23:02 +0000 <naval> Every discussion should work like this.
1019835645450117121 2018-07-19 06:45:40 +0000 <naval> @farnamstreet Brilliant thread. I would add (for 1:1s):   https://t.co/CwFL6nOn5h
1019770607792033792 2018-07-19 02:27:13 +0000 <naval> @real_vijay @dksf You‚Äôve been civil, which I appreciate. In summary, I‚Äôm a HODLer too but was lamenting that there‚Äôs no decentralized way to incent developers to stay on the big chains rather than creating a new chain for every feature. I used an unfortunate term which triggered folks.
1019770131583401984 2018-07-19 02:25:20 +0000 <naval> @real_vijay @dksf I‚Äôve replied to these points dozens of times, check my reply feed please. Little exhausted.

1019769060727316480 2018-07-19 02:21:05 +0000 <naval> @Xplorationality @thecheesenose Big fan. I can quote ‚ÄúBrahma‚Äù by heart. The list is by no means exhaustive.
1019767700162138112 2018-07-19 02:15:40 +0000 <naval> @real_vijay @dksf This has been an interesting lesson in that, if our identity feels threatened, then we are literally incapable of acknowledging facts.
1019767172640280577 2018-07-19 02:13:34 +0000 <naval> @AwashInEchoes @real_vijay @dksf Relatively speaking, yes. But I wouldn‚Äôt use those words again given how they seem to trigger people who aren‚Äôt used to economics jargon.
1019766115398893568 2018-07-19 02:09:22 +0000 <naval> @real_vijay @dksf The developers are both HODLers + writing code. In that sense, someone who merely HODLs is, by definition, doing less. Why is that so hard to see? (HODL + code) &gt; HODL. It‚Äôs literally math.
1019765851824664576 2018-07-19 02:08:20 +0000 <naval> @GauravMPatel @real_vijay @dksf Exactly.
1019760718369849344 2018-07-19 01:47:56 +0000 <naval> @real_vijay @dksf You‚Äôre basically in the position of arguing that incentives are worth zero and that code is worth zero. Not a great corner to be in.
1019760562861830144 2018-07-19 01:47:19 +0000 <naval> @real_vijay @dksf Possibly. I brought up the point in the context of why many developers work on alts. And there‚Äôs plenty of evidence that even OSS developers respond to incentives. Again, math: (Incentives + Mission) &gt; Mission.
1019497519166865413 2018-07-18 08:22:04 +0000 <naval> @DavidDeutschOxf @primalpoly Popper‚Äôs criteria: Good scientific theories make risky predictions, prohibit many outcomes, are testable / falsifiable, and are hard to vary in the face of contradictory data.
1019496023721271296 2018-07-18 08:16:08 +0000 <naval> @JeffLonsdale Not a 1:1 correspondence of course, but I agree.  Productivity-driven deflation is a net positive.

1019494234544455680 2018-07-18 08:09:01 +0000 <naval> @JeffLonsdale Understood, it‚Äôs the productivity increase that makes it all acceptable.   What if productivity increases are grossly unevenly distributed? Say tech workers are driving deflation but nurses aren‚Äôt becoming more productive?
1019490407170732032 2018-07-18 07:53:48 +0000 <naval> @JeffLonsdale Two things I‚Äôm unsure about:  ‚Ä¢ Sticky wages argument  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù (hyper) inflation is a net transfer of economic growth to debtors. ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù (gold / Bitcoin) deflation is a net transfer of economic growth to creditors. True or False?
1019489751152246784 2018-07-18 07:51:12 +0000 <naval> @KevinSimler @patrissimo @JeffLonsdale That only happens if the return on investment is lower than the deflation rate. I.e., the investment has to grow faster than the economy as a whole is growing.
1019489487305388032 2018-07-18 07:50:09 +0000 <naval> @KevinSimler @patrissimo @JeffLonsdale Are ‚Äústicky wages‚Äù an issue?

1019396077735194624 2018-07-18 01:38:59 +0000 <naval> @AriannaSimpson Feels like some of the money that was going to buy public assets has been rerouted into private assets by new funds. Could be an elaborate form of capital flight.
1019388514704621569 2018-07-18 01:08:55 +0000 <naval> @PathToMars I would go to a startup or a technology company, especially given that you have an engineering background.

1019228098506575873 2018-07-17 14:31:29 +0000 <naval> @BrianTHeligman @srirangr Then you may like Lord of Light. It‚Äôs the only sci-fi novel that I know of where the protagonist is a Buddha.

But the way Bitcoin is set up, miners get paid their opportunity cost but devs don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why you get a lot of devs running ICOs instead of contributing to Bitcoin. It‚Äôs basic incentive math.

1018481732075393024 2018-07-15 13:05:42 +0000 <naval> @jeremyrwelch @TheFlamcake @balajis @udiWertheimer Free riding is not an absolute thing. It can be measured in dollars (or BTC). Grandma‚Äôs contribution is $20/hour, a crypto dev may be $500/hour, a passive, quiet owner might be contributing $0/hour.
1018481314729611269 2018-07-15 13:04:02 +0000 <naval> @jeremyrwelch @TheFlamcake @balajis @udiWertheimer True, you can do other things like marketing etc. But it seems that crypto devs are the highest in-demand resource. I was observing that this gap is what funnels devs to creating new coins rather than improving the existing ones.

1018336123989291008 2018-07-15 03:27:06 +0000 <naval> @jaybny @Sam_seau @fluffypony @WhalePanda I think blocking is warranted when it turns into name calling and personal attacks. No one has to sit and listen when they are being attacked.  Keep in mind that unlike most people with large followings, I read all mentions and respond to many.
1018335747303137280 2018-07-15 03:25:36 +0000 <naval> @jaybny @Sam_seau @fluffypony @WhalePanda To be clear I don‚Äôt block if people disagree. Feel free to disagree. I block because they get angry, curse, or make it personal.

1015608864970981376 2018-07-07 14:49:57 +0000 <naval> @beingMana @ycombinator Don‚Äôt think it would apply.
1015607950474240001 2018-07-07 14:46:19 +0000 <naval> VCs and universities are both in the business of hunting black swans. They filter the applicant funnel, brand selected candidates, and harvest the winners rep to further enlarge the funnel.  @ycombinator ‚Äòs genius was to use the older, optimized university system to mechanize VC.

1013500678868570113 2018-07-01 19:12:46 +0000 <naval> @RainIsWetter @bradmillscan I was explaining to a bunch of HODLers in the thread (not developers) why most new developers are following their incentives and contributing elsewhere.
1013498272269283328 2018-07-01 19:03:12 +0000 <naval> @RainIsWetter @bradmillscan Read the whole thread. The context was HODLers are free riders relative to new developers who are expected to work on Bitcoin. Brand new devs have an incentive to go elsewhere. That‚Äôs what I was lamenting. But it‚Äôs cool to take everything out of context and get outraged.

Early mining doesn‚Äôt work as a pure miner will outperform you. The Satoshi head start doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Thus premines. Incentives are everything.
1013322658245591040 2018-07-01 07:25:23 +0000 <naval> The ideal school would teach health, wealth, and happiness.  It‚Äòd be free, self-paced, and available to all.

1013306742204055552 2018-07-01 06:22:08 +0000 <naval> @paul_btc @schifter_ Bitcoin maximalism ignores developer incentives and the free rider problem. And incentives are the most powerful force in human society.
1013306482819923968 2018-07-01 06:21:06 +0000 <naval> @paul_btc @schifter_ Maybe. If they have their own usage tokens, then it incents the developers and investors. And incentives are powerful. Code can swap tokens in real-time.

1002106893265920000 2018-05-31 08:37:56 +0000 <naval> Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
1002106775036874752 2018-05-31 08:37:28 +0000 <naval> Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
1002106698889183234 2018-05-31 08:37:09 +0000 <naval> Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don‚Äôt waste your life chasing it.
1002106623639212032 2018-05-31 08:36:51 +0000 <naval> Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.
1002106317064949763 2018-05-31 08:35:38 +0000 <naval> Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
1002105838713028609 2018-05-31 08:33:44 +0000 <naval> The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.
1002105652792066048 2018-05-31 08:33:00 +0000 <naval> Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.
1002105243767787520 2018-05-31 08:31:22 +0000 <naval> Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.
1002105194170085376 2018-05-31 08:31:11 +0000 <naval> When specific knowledge is taught, it‚Äôs through apprenticeships, not schools.
1002105148733206528 2018-05-31 08:31:00 +0000 <naval> Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.
1002105081855016961 2018-05-31 08:30:44 +0000 <naval> Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.
1002104947624722433 2018-05-31 08:30:12 +0000 <naval> Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.
1002104865919664128 2018-05-31 08:29:52 +0000 <naval> Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.
1002104083694501890 2018-05-31 08:26:46 +0000 <naval> Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.
1002103969781448704 2018-05-31 08:26:19 +0000 <naval> Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.
1002103908947263488 2018-05-31 08:26:04 +0000 <naval> Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.
1002103832879419392 2018-05-31 08:25:46 +0000 <naval> The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.
1002103770518441989 2018-05-31 08:25:31 +0000 <naval> Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.
1002103723848450049 2018-05-31 08:25:20 +0000 <naval> You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.
1002103670400417792 2018-05-31 08:25:07 +0000 <naval> You‚Äôre not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.
1002103627387813888 2018-05-31 08:24:57 +0000 <naval> Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.
1002103559276478464 2018-05-31 08:24:41 +0000 <naval> Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.
1002103497725173760 2018-05-31 08:24:26 +0000 <naval> Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.

1001905796479778816 2018-05-30 19:18:51 +0000 <naval> The older the problem, the older the solution. How to eat well is one of the oldest problems.
1001902453585932288 2018-05-30 19:05:34 +0000 <naval> School, politics, sports, and games train us to compete against others. True rewards - wealth, knowledge, love, fitness, and equanimity - come from ignoring others and improving ourselves.

1000927764852166656 2018-05-28 02:32:30 +0000 <naval> @andrewchen @nickabouzeid Aha. So scooters can oversupply which means their peak:average mismatch should be smaller and passes may work. But licensing artificially lowers supply, destroys subscription economics, but creates its own barrier to entry.
1000925803192954882 2018-05-28 02:24:42 +0000 <naval> @loomstate1 @andrewchen @nickabouzeid At least in SF, Pool has many commuters.

1000923682087333888 2018-05-28 02:16:16 +0000 <naval> @nickabouzeid @andrewchen So to avoid becoming a zero margin business, you need some network effects and economies of scale in charging / repair. And IMHO those are weak.
1000923486796288001 2018-05-28 02:15:30 +0000 <naval> @nickabouzeid @andrewchen Over time we should expect scooter hardware prices to go to zero and network maintenance costs to dominate. (They self-market so marketing may not be a big factor).
1000923206889459713 2018-05-28 02:14:23 +0000 <naval> @nickabouzeid @andrewchen Most relatively short runs I‚Äôve done we‚Äôre in the $5 range. $15 is a short 3-ride payback. That blows away most profits for scooter companies.
1000921477905043462 2018-05-28 02:07:31 +0000 <naval> @nickabouzeid @andrewchen What‚Äôs the ideal price point? At $20+/month some power users will buy their own scooter. Below that and it doesn‚Äôt cover many trips.
1000920130250067969 2018-05-28 02:02:09 +0000 <naval> @trengriffin @andrewchen @nickabouzeid Right. Is this more like rental cars or airlines? How did bike share in China finally end up? (Honest question).

1000918118343077888 2018-05-28 01:54:10 +0000 <naval> @msuster Scooter companies also initially pitched proprietary scooter supply from China. That didn‚Äôt last. IF mechanics are ultra-skilled you may be right but at some point it becomes cheaper to replace than repair (as Apple does).
1000917708723163137 2018-05-28 01:52:32 +0000 <naval> @msuster Closer analogy is when autonomous vehicles arrive. In that sense, scooter networks are an interesting predictor of Uber‚Äôs fate in that world.

992546135943200773 2018-05-04 23:26:54 +0000 <naval> @jaekwon Yup, involving the patent office is a terrible solution. But then the alternative that some projects will adopt is gradually open source or partially closed.
992545214576259072 2018-05-04 23:23:14 +0000 <naval> @brucefenton That's a heavy lift. Basically you're saying to create a lock-in at a higher layer. Why not just release code or patents more slowly to give yourself time.
992544020046888960 2018-05-04 23:18:29 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong You can open-source some parts now and others later. You can have expiring patents and copyrights. All-or-nothing may be philosophically true to some people, but it's not practically true. The real world is full of hybrid examples.

992534541817413632 2018-05-04 22:40:49 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong If you're a tech team out of a top university shipping a novel breakthrough, how do you prevent a chain with poor technology but an existing community from cloning you before you've had a chance to build community?
992533681074946048 2018-05-04 22:37:24 +0000 <naval> @JaEsf @lightcoin I'm not as sanguine. I think we'll see late-mover scientists in the space adopting temporary closed-source or patents to give their community development a chance to catch up. "Open Source" in tech normally captures a small fraction of the development - most source is closed.
992533037941313537 2018-05-04 22:34:51 +0000 <naval> @dantwany @VinnyLingham @civickey Is there a writeup / explanation of the @civickey closed source strategy anywhere?
992532427317825536 2018-05-04 22:32:25 +0000 <naval> @lightcoin That's a solution for investors, not the technologists.
992532323865247745 2018-05-04 22:32:01 +0000 <naval> @lightcoin The thesis here is that incumbents will get faster at copying. And there is a new breed of incumbents with lousy technology, pre-existing community, and no qualms about copying and pasting code as quickly as possible.

992530125810880512 2018-05-04 22:23:16 +0000 <naval> @StephenPiment The future certainly points towards rapid and complete cloning of technical innovations from new blockchains when the latter are too new to have established much community. Scientists in the space that I know are becoming more careful / secretive.
992529442286125057 2018-05-04 22:20:34 +0000 <naval> @lightcoin What if an existing blockchain with a community is copying code from emerging blockchains before the latter have a chance to build a community? Strangled in the crib?

992326276709957632 2018-05-04 08:53:15 +0000 <naval> One reason that freedom of speech is so important is that doubt is the foundation of science.   When you close a topic to discussion, you are saying that it is decided, and scientific inquiry is no longer allowed into that domain.

985089822950752256 2018-04-14 09:38:10 +0000 <naval> @whatbitcoindid Fair. ‚ÄúMost‚Äù was an overstatement. But I still think we will see a coin emerge that better incents a huge developer network to improve the core protocol itself.
985086231682793473 2018-04-14 09:23:54 +0000 <naval> @hugohanoi Yes. Not a good route for a SoV coin. The best way to keep a train on the track is to remove the steering altogether.
985083310266204162 2018-04-14 09:12:17 +0000 <naval> @L1AD Anecdotally true but not usually true. These stories are fun because they are exceptions. Capitalism argues otherwise.
985082929851203584 2018-04-14 09:10:47 +0000 <naval> @msgnode Fair point. It‚Äôs case by case depending on the magnitude of the innovation.
985082752138600448 2018-04-14 09:10:04 +0000 <naval> @hugohanoi Historically that hasn‚Äôt happened much. My guess is: ‚Ä¢ More Treasury models like DASH ‚Ä¢ Inflation funding with centralized grants during the early period. ‚Ä¢ Inflation funding for technology / team acquisitions (speculative and further out and yes, centralized).

985078434421399552 2018-04-14 08:52:55 +0000 <naval> @hugohanoi For the non-private pure-SoV use case, there‚Äôs a good argument that Bitcoin is done, should stay simple and decentralized.  For the ‚ÄúGlobal Computing Platform‚Äù use case, further innovation is likely needed. So ongoing incentives for development matter.
985077647238512641 2018-04-14 08:49:47 +0000 <naval> @hugohanoi But in this Cambrian Coin Explosion, we will see coins that use inflation funding and centralized grants to fund engineering for a while, and then switch to decentralized models.
985077369340805120 2018-04-14 08:48:41 +0000 <naval> @hugohanoi But there seems to be no decentralized, on-chain solution to the problem.  But the market will test BTC and ETH by creating ‚Äúinnovation incentives.‚Äù BTC has a weak implicit one (own some BTC). ETH has a slightly stronger one (ERC 20).
985076995963764736 2018-04-14 08:47:12 +0000 <naval> @hugohanoi What we have right now is suboptimal incentive allocation - all the rewards are going to founders, early investors and miners. None to late developers. Which leads to more independent blockchains that would exist otherwise.
985076716178571264 2018-04-14 08:46:05 +0000 <naval> @hugohanoi What I don‚Äôt buy is the argument that good developers don‚Äôt need to be paid (not saying you‚Äôre making it, others are). It‚Äôs an AND not an OR.  Anyone designing an incentive system should acknowledge Free Rider and Tragedy of the Commons.
985076261637640193 2018-04-14 08:44:17 +0000 <naval> @hugohanoi Agreed. I can‚Äôt come up with a decentralized, on-chain solution for incenting developers either:   https://t.co/cMh68l24wK
985030634715467776 2018-04-14 05:42:58 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong You‚Äôre making absolutist arguments against a straw man. I‚Äôm simply saying that a large coin that incented future development would capture more future development. It‚Äôs almost tautological.

985025569199939584 2018-04-14 05:22:51 +0000 <naval> @tomgarrambone @prestonjbyrne Developers want to be paid commensurate to their value add and opportunity costs. And they deserve to be.
985023970192785409 2018-04-14 05:16:30 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong There are plenty of innovative ones although I grant that they are swimming in a sea of junk.
985023794174660608 2018-04-14 05:15:48 +0000 <naval> @prestonjbyrne So the future then is forks and sets. I‚Äôm just observing that existing protocols would be more competitive if they had significant development rewards, not just mining rewards.
985022998435508229 2018-04-14 05:12:38 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong Because the market is rewarding innovation. And that innovation flows to where it‚Äôs best rewarded.
985020668000468992 2018-04-14 05:03:22 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong It would have to commensurate to value added / increase in market cap.
985020040872329218 2018-04-14 05:00:53 +0000 <naval> @MayorOfBitcoin Exactly.
985019660339998725 2018-04-14 04:59:22 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong It would channel the greed back into Bitcoin and Ethereum development.

982802175159025669 2018-04-08 02:07:52 +0000 <naval> @Cryptomancer_ The Dark Forest Hypothesis also assumes that communicating with a civilization is harder than destroying it.    It‚Äôs a fun hypothesis but hardly a steel trap explanation for the Fermi Paradox. As you say, the Rational Optimist shows the more likely outcome.
982801671951544321 2018-04-08 02:05:52 +0000 <naval> @Cryptomancer_ Furthermore, the most advanced civilizations would both have trade as well as have overcome the aggressive tendency. Aggressive civilizations would have likely weeded themselves out of the gene pool via internal warfare.
982801335216041986 2018-04-08 02:04:32 +0000 <naval> @Cryptomancer_ I found the chain of suspicion to be a logical plot device but too contrived for the real world.

981115583503585281 2018-04-03 10:25:58 +0000 <naval> @MichaelBabich @jwangARK @elmambablanco Positing that it‚Äôs easier to destroy a civilization (with no threat of second-strike retaliation) than to communicate with it, is a massive contrivance.
981112683272392704 2018-04-03 10:14:26 +0000 <naval> @JoParisot @elmambablanco @jwangARK Liu set up physics and tech in his system to make Dark Forest more plausible.

981112080282542080 2018-04-03 10:12:02 +0000 <naval> @MichaelBabich @jwangARK @elmambablanco It was contrived for the plot. Note the sophons allowed long distance communication via quantum entanglement. Liu set up his physics and technology to make Dark Forest more plausible.

981020143974105090 2018-04-03 04:06:43 +0000 <naval> @jwangARK @elmambablanco Long before you have the power to destroy a remote civ, you have the power to destroy your own. So each civ has to tame itself to live long enough to be a threat to others. Which implies that powerful survivors are rational pacifists with second-strike capabilities.
981019483031547904 2018-04-03 04:04:05 +0000 <naval> @jwangARK @elmambablanco Yup, same as on earth today. There‚Äôs the rub. That‚Äôs why if I had to assign probabilities, I would guess that all civilizations self destruct after a certain progress level.
981018995737354240 2018-04-03 04:02:09 +0000 <naval> @elmambablanco @jwangARK Yup, there‚Äôs wireheading, simulation hypothesis, self-destruction, vast distances, benevolent observers, apathy, dark forest, etc. All are possible.
981018055063961602 2018-04-03 03:58:25 +0000 <naval> @jwangARK @elmambablanco Defenders would broadcast Doomsday / MAD capability, pledge no first-strike, and promise open-source tech transfer and trade to cooperators. Encourage communication over first strikes. Basically how nuclear powers relate today.
981014749180706816 2018-04-03 03:45:17 +0000 <naval> @jwangARK @elmambablanco Imagine every country on earth had a doomsday weapon. You‚Äôd end up with the UN and lots of talking. And either large-scale peace or complete annihilation. Neither of which makes for an interesting storyline.
981014222841700352 2018-04-03 03:43:11 +0000 <naval> @jwangARK @elmambablanco MAD can work without attribution. See Dr. Strangelove. I.e., if you take me out, I take out the neighborhood. Which then takes out all adjacent neighborhoods. And so on. It‚Äôs a stable, but fragile solution.
981013633541971969 2018-04-03 03:40:51 +0000 <naval> @elmambablanco @jwangARK Nobody knows. I don‚Äôt have a notion of a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answer. I‚Äôm just saying that Liu‚Äôs is more of a literary plot device than a game-theoretic certainty.
981013224823840768 2018-04-03 03:39:13 +0000 <naval> @jwangARK @elmambablanco Also, the technology and trade transfer benefits between two spacefaring alien races could be astronomical. Cooperators would likely outcompete xenophobes, as happened across human tribes on earth.
981012953913675776 2018-04-03 03:38:09 +0000 <naval> @jwangARK @elmambablanco But you couldn‚Äôt know that the target civilization had no tracing capabilities. Or stealthy revenge-seeking FTL craft / AI. Or Galaxy-wide doomsday-triggered singularities. Certainly, you wouldn‚Äôt be cavalier enough to launch photoids casually.
980989445364072448 2018-04-03 02:04:44 +0000 <naval> @elmambablanco @jwangARK Liu only followed the game theory partway to create a good plot device. Followed fully, the universe would be full of hidden nuclear submarines. Anyone striking first would risk retaliation from hidden webs of Mutually Assured Destruction.
980989074432409600 2018-04-03 02:03:15 +0000 <naval> @elmambablanco @jwangARK Agreed but humans cooperate across their species‚Äô genetic boundaries. An advanced life form may be able to cooperate with other advanced life forms. Also a sufficiently advanced life form would develop pre-emptive doomsday devices to dissuade first strikes.
980972194871238657 2018-04-03 00:56:11 +0000 <naval> @jwangARK Great series. Although I don‚Äôt think the Dark Forest Hypothesis is as airtight as he makes it out to be.

979865634639986688 2018-03-30 23:39:06 +0000 <naval> Smart partners negotiate fair deals because they know that lopsided deals are fragile and that most value accumulates in long term trust relationships.  You can tell a lot about a potential partner by their opening offer.

964375606199599111 2018-02-16 05:47:16 +0000 <naval> So for a Curation Business, start with a brand and keep your standards high.
964375455573819393 2018-02-16 05:46:40 +0000 <naval> Nor can you select too many candidates (unless you‚Äôre good at burying your failures). It‚Äôll cheapen your curation signal.
964375205215846400 2018-02-16 05:45:40 +0000 <naval> What doesn‚Äôt work well is to just enter the business and assume that you‚Äôll build a brand over time. You may never get enough high quality applicants.
964374922632900608 2018-02-16 05:44:33 +0000 <naval> The hardest part is the initial branding. You can do it by bringing an existing brand from the outside, addressing a new vertical, an audacious new approach, or by creating unique content.
964374393429217280 2018-02-16 05:42:27 +0000 <naval> if you‚Äôre building one of these businesses, use marketing, judgement, and execution to optimize this brand-based virtuous circle.
964374283131604992 2018-02-16 05:42:00 +0000 <naval> The curator repeats the cycle, now with a stronger umbrella brand.
964374173169590277 2018-02-16 05:41:34 +0000 <naval> The winning alumni brands reinforce the curator‚Äôs umbrella brand.
964374022401155074 2018-02-16 05:40:58 +0000 <naval> The emerging winners become proud alumni
964373899579289602 2018-02-16 05:40:29 +0000 <naval> The curated use the curator‚Äôs umbrella brand to gain validation with the rest of the world.
964373809972232192 2018-02-16 05:40:08 +0000 <naval> They educate and help the curated in alignment with their brand.
964373712567877632 2018-02-16 05:39:44 +0000 <naval> They run a tight filter to select the best of the best.
964373627515715585 2018-02-16 05:39:24 +0000 <naval> They build an umbrella brand to attract as many applicants as possible.
964373521492094976 2018-02-16 05:38:59 +0000 <naval> Universities, Incubators, and Venture Capital firms are really ‚ÄúCuration Businesses.‚Äù
963861508072488960 2018-02-14 19:44:25 +0000 <naval> To be clear folks, this is a game, at best. These cards aren‚Äôt worth anything. Not sure why people are bidding them up.
963858597342986241 2018-02-14 19:32:51 +0000 <naval> 4% of each sale which I‚Äôll either donate to charity or not collect. Get a grip.
963858222380605440 2018-02-14 19:31:22 +0000 <naval> @analyticascent Assuming that the winner is actually willing to compensate the loser. Easy when it‚Äôs a bilateral business transaction, difficult for multilateral, personal, or political.
963850360321228801 2018-02-14 19:00:08 +0000 <naval> Now I‚Äôm a bubble.  https://t.co/BtnAsiS0EY

963670954093285376 2018-02-14 07:07:14 +0000 <naval> @fazinga Analyzing the structure of politics vs. engaging in politics. Like an anthropologist rather than their subject.
963641063532572672 2018-02-14 05:08:27 +0000 <naval> @NickTheSilent The collective will just vote that away. I‚Äôm afraid that tyranny of the majority is a built-in feature of democracy. You can delay it with high vote thresholds but at the end of the day, democracy is majority rule.
963615154800771072 2018-02-14 03:25:30 +0000 <naval> @bill_phillips I made the same point, it‚Äôs emergent. Whether there‚Äôs a better alternative is up for debate though. Beyond two sometimes gives too much power to the fringe.
963610456949534722 2018-02-14 03:06:50 +0000 <naval> @mt_1466 @CryptoGrowers Thanks, blocked him.
963564976425152512 2018-02-14 00:06:07 +0000 <naval> @gojomo The median voter theorem ignores advertising costs. Also, to actually get someone to vote, you have to inspire them (activation energy). Hard to do that in the middle. Perhaps it needs an update.
963563145850585088 2018-02-13 23:58:50 +0000 <naval> @gojomo Fair point.
963561417956667392 2018-02-13 23:51:58 +0000 <naval> The future revolution will be digital.
963561330459332608 2018-02-13 23:51:37 +0000 <naval> The freer societies of the last few hundred years were founded through escape. Found a new colony or kingdom.
963561280274509824 2018-02-13 23:51:25 +0000 <naval> The long arc of politics bends towards centralization. And no internal revolution is possible when the system is (accidentally) designed for two parties only.
963561227342393344 2018-02-13 23:51:13 +0000 <naval> That trade off mainly makes sense at a local level. If most spending was local, it would be a different equation.   But power continues to coalesce in central authorities.
963561141791150080 2018-02-13 23:50:52 +0000 <naval> But who has the time? Everyone is busy. You‚Äôre either bought into a party brand or apathy. Or you‚Äôre spending enormous personal time for tiny social gains.
963561093166608384 2018-02-13 23:50:41 +0000 <naval> As @nntaleb showed, the most intolerant minority can win. But its intolerance must be for political parties, party platforms and their soldiers. Assess each candidate on their own merits.
963560994780856320 2018-02-13 23:50:17 +0000 <naval> The presidency used to be part of the two party system. But media splintered and political ads don‚Äôt work like they used to. Social media + crowdfunding means that the Presidency is the first office where independents and outsiders have a shot.
963560946856738816 2018-02-13 23:50:06 +0000 <naval> Voters can pledge their vote to a third party candidate, keep track of pledges, and only cast their vote when the candidate has the desired threshold. If not, vote for your normal big party candidates.  (This system is however vulnerable to sybil attacks and fake pledges).
963560887826051073 2018-02-13 23:49:52 +0000 <naval> The Internet provides the means to coordinate a vote for a third party.
963560833157537792 2018-02-13 23:49:39 +0000 <naval> When the country swings too far to the right, you get Obama. Too far to the left, you get Trump. Too far to the Trump and...?
963560790698598401 2018-02-13 23:49:29 +0000 <naval> Both parties take extreme positions, speaking a different language. When the normally apathetic middle bothers to vote, it wins.
963560745475612672 2018-02-13 23:49:18 +0000 <naval> Democracy survives at the margin - the most powerful voter is the rational Independent whose vote isn‚Äôt promised to anyone.
963560691691962368 2018-02-13 23:49:05 +0000 <naval> Looking for someone to blame for consolidation of power? There's no one to blame. That's just how power works.
963560627053633536 2018-02-13 23:48:50 +0000 <naval> Looking for someone to blame for polarization? There‚Äôs no one to blame. The system is the problem.
963560549593182208 2018-02-13 23:48:31 +0000 <naval> And neither one wants to talk about endless wars, mass surveillance, university costs, infinite debt, over-classification, and corruption.
963560479598690304 2018-02-13 23:48:15 +0000 <naval> On health care, one party is talking about minimal human decency while the other party is doesn't want health care run by the DMV.
963560423562727425 2018-02-13 23:48:01 +0000 <naval> On guns, one party is talking about mass-murder while the opposite party is now talking about self-sovereignty.
963560206478143493 2018-02-13 23:47:09 +0000 <naval> On abortion, one party is talking about the definition of life while the other party is talking about self-sovereignty.
963560161104154625 2018-02-13 23:46:59 +0000 <naval> On immigration, one party is talking about legal immigrants while the other party is talking about illegal immigrants.
963560093600989184 2018-02-13 23:46:43 +0000 <naval> When you're on completely opposite sides of an issue, it's even easier to just talk about two different issues and call them the same thing.
963560049145597952 2018-02-13 23:46:32 +0000 <naval> The two parties then are under selective pressure to evolve as far apart. If they drift towards the other party, then they risk creating apathy when they want passion.   Therefore, there‚Äôs no "middle ground party" in politics.
963559975686627328 2018-02-13 23:46:14 +0000 <naval> The parties have to brand strongly as strongly as possible, to create the faithful core and to hook the apathetic. To make them play the game.
963559918904094720 2018-02-13 23:46:01 +0000 <naval> Scale effects rule the world around me. Including when it comes to branding, spreading messages, rallying resources.
963559870178848769 2018-02-13 23:45:49 +0000 <naval> The parties want to get as many voters as possible. The majority of voters are apathetic, not even playing the political game.
963559811282423809 2018-02-13 23:45:35 +0000 <naval> It is the nature of a winner-take-all system to consolidate down to two entities.  Any third-place party can always combine with the second-place party to become the new first-place party.  Therefore, our system can only represent two choices on any given topic.
963559678138396673 2018-02-13 23:45:03 +0000 <naval> A Political party is a coalition to monopolize the vote.  The framers of the constitution neglected to ban political parties, as it would infringe upon freedom of speech. So political parties monopolized the vote.
963559320947367941 2018-02-13 23:43:38 +0000 <naval> The two party system is an emergent "bug" in representative democracy.  https://t.co/hBKpukhkR5
963549334494068736 2018-02-13 23:03:57 +0000 <naval> @nondualnelly @AriDavidPaul Sure. You could give these cards powers / abilities. I.e., holder can get one question per month answered on Twitter or Periscope or something like that. Different for each card of course.
963169758903349249 2018-02-12 21:55:40 +0000 <naval> @foreverfire123 @intjr Makes sense. Thanks.
963120670598053890 2018-02-12 18:40:36 +0000 <naval> @intjr No interest in monetization. Perhaps someone is willing to convert the Periscope to YouTube and to gather questions in advance.
963120412153360385 2018-02-12 18:39:34 +0000 <naval> @almaCrypto Thanks, but that sounds like a job. I like the spontaneity of periscope.
962925169130942465 2018-02-12 05:43:45 +0000 <naval> @nakadelic Streaming is seamless.
962923263381811202 2018-02-12 05:36:10 +0000 <naval> The Apple HomePod crushes it on sound quality. Siri remains awful but it sounds like a much more expensive and larger speaker.
962912723884363776 2018-02-12 04:54:18 +0000 <naval> @Ben_Reinhardt Still not zero sum as the two candidates can just work on different new projects.

962446161733828609 2018-02-10 22:00:20 +0000 <naval> Engaging in politics habituates and rewires the brain to value agreement and signaling. It weakens the ability to reason independently and clearly.

956814959530225664 2018-01-26 09:03:57 +0000 <naval> @CryptoAmbit Fair. But it‚Äôs such an eye-popping number that I may take the tweet down until we can corroborate it. The larger point about SK being all-in stands, of course. Thanks again.

956810181152616448 2018-01-26 08:44:58 +0000 <naval> Doesn‚Äôt mean everyone should run out and buy cryptocurrency at these prices... Too many of the top 20 are still scams or shams.

956249935107665920 2018-01-24 19:38:45 +0000 <naval> @shaftgunk Likes and retweets indicate otherwise. I think commentary is also a reflection of the evolution of Twitter and the increase in my follower base.
956199057264799744 2018-01-24 16:16:35 +0000 <naval> First round of coin airdrops went to devs and miners. Second round to investors and BTC / ETH holders. Third round will try to reach every human on the planet.
956047683654967296 2018-01-24 06:15:04 +0000 <naval> @gunar @muneeb Same sentiment, opposite nomenclature.
955998687670411264 2018-01-24 03:00:23 +0000 <naval> Bitcoin is a tool for freeing humanity from oligarchs and tyrants, dressed up as a get-rich-quick scheme.

954569244670287872 2018-01-20 04:20:17 +0000 <naval> The crypto startups are showing that the last barrier to distributed startups is the geographic concentration of venture capital.

954278411366576129 2018-01-19 09:04:37 +0000 <naval> @alanizBTC The ending of that kind of crime, captured on camera, takes the more roundabout form of revolution.
954277855889780739 2018-01-19 09:02:25 +0000 <naval> A contrarian isn‚Äôt one who always objects - that‚Äôs a confirmist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently, from the ground up, and resists pressure to conform.
954263461910913029 2018-01-19 08:05:13 +0000 <naval> The real struggle isn‚Äôt proletariat vs bourgeois. It‚Äôs between high-status elites and wealthy elites. When their cooperation breaks, revolution.

953918550179160065 2018-01-18 09:14:39 +0000 <naval> @nateritter Fair point. But solitaire, like most successful games, feels like a human designed and engineered hack against dopamine reward circuitry.

917578554920931328 2017-10-10 02:32:29 +0000 <naval> @0xjue1 @brandonhinesley The market is rational. Coin market ranking sites assume it‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs lazier / easier to not calc dilution. @onchainfx fixes it.
917578178079502336 2017-10-10 02:31:00 +0000 <naval> @0xjue1 @brandonhinesley Yes, but that ‚Äúcurrent market cap‚Äù number should use all known information, including future dilution, not just the current outstanding.
917577906380988416 2017-10-10 02:29:55 +0000 <naval> @Dan_In_Boulder Otherwise it‚Äôs a trivially gamed metric. Just frontload all of the issuance.
917577791318536192 2017-10-10 02:29:27 +0000 <naval> @Dan_In_Boulder Because the market is saying that $ZEC is valuable despite the upcoming dilution. Market cap calculation should reflect that.
917577515664683008 2017-10-10 02:28:22 +0000 <naval> @Dan_In_Boulder So then we are just debating the definition of market cap, not the fundamentals. IMHO I prefer the one that is ‚Äúfully diluted.‚Äù
917573446871040000 2017-10-10 02:12:12 +0000 <naval> @Dan_In_Boulder Nope. When future issuance is known, price incorporates it. If a company declares upcoming dilution, share price falls immediately.

914961338635448321 2017-10-02 21:12:36 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong The best structure will ICO the minimum needed for investment. Rest should go for future development and mining.

914938262602473472 2017-10-02 19:40:55 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong Price/GB in Filecoin actually declines. Rise in net capacity captured in price of Filecoin - a liquid claim on revenues for % of the network
914937726952103936 2017-10-02 19:38:47 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong I.e. Number of Filecoin constant, network capacity rises, each Filecoin represents more capacity. USD/GB constant but GB/Filecoin up.
914937287414235136 2017-10-02 19:37:02 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong Price per unit in USD won‚Äôt change but number of units represented by each token increases. Price/unit constant, but revenue / token rises.
914936355100123137 2017-10-02 19:33:20 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong For a company that issues tokens and equity, value goes into tokens unless company creates new revenue stream that tokens aren‚Äôt entitled to
914935942170894336 2017-10-02 19:31:41 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong Basically true. If all tokens were burned after ICO, all revenue would be lost. Selling a token now gives up the claim on higher rev later.
914930540939141121 2017-10-02 19:10:14 +0000 <naval> @jimmysong Tokens give you a claim on a percentage of revenue, not a fixed USD amount. As far as Amazon is concerned, a gift card used == lost revenue.
914929767597535233 2017-10-02 19:07:09 +0000 <naval> @_roncho_ In practice you can‚Äôt.
914921800202575877 2017-10-02 18:35:30 +0000 <naval> Investors may prefer tokens over equity - tokens give direct ownership of revenue, equity may be profits trapped inside corporate structure.

913476545850654721 2017-09-28 18:52:34 +0000 <naval> @ChoubeySahab I would just say that sitting down on a cushion and watching my thoughts or trying to clear my mind has never done much for me.

912707999667384327 2017-09-26 15:58:39 +0000 <naval> 12/ Editorial outrage is a signaling good. That‚Äôs why former news outlets have switched from facts to opinions and outrage.
912707909250777088 2017-09-26 15:58:17 +0000 <naval> 11/ Social media has degenerated into a deafening cacophony of groups signaling and repeating their shared myths.
912707794574368768 2017-09-26 15:57:50 +0000 <naval> 10/ Religious myths, secret histories, conspiracy theories, unfalsifiable beliefs, scapegoats...
912707648729911296 2017-09-26 15:57:15 +0000 <naval> 9/ Every group has a set of shared myths that signal to believers and against outsiders.
912707153219133440 2017-09-26 15:55:17 +0000 <naval> 7/ The further, the faster, and the more easily something can be shared, the better it is for signaling. Social media fuels signaling.
912706780211195905 2017-09-26 15:53:48 +0000 <naval> 6/ Signaling goods can be physical - handbags, watches, and fancy cars. They can be virtual - political, religious, and tribal affiliations.
912706329675931649 2017-09-26 15:52:00 +0000 <naval> 5/ Signaling goods signal status and affiliation to the other monkeys. They have value when produced or consumed conspicuously.
912706227641008128 2017-09-26 15:51:36 +0000 <naval> 4/ While the business model for distributing facts and truth dies out, the model for distributing opinions and signaling goods is booming.
912705933637148673 2017-09-26 15:50:26 +0000 <naval> 3/ Newspapers have been exposed as mostly reprinting Reuters and AP. They can‚Äôt make a living selling access to facts anymore.
912705810194505728 2017-09-26 15:49:57 +0000 <naval> 2/ The facts are still there and people can still reach them. But the institutions selling access to facts have lost their business models.
912705663234539520 2017-09-26 15:49:22 +0000 <naval> 1/ The Internet lowers the returns to distributing facts, while social media increases the returns to distributing signaling goods.

912225103605141504 2017-09-25 07:59:47 +0000 <naval> @ultimape I was looking for that one. Thanks :-)
912224395644461057 2017-09-25 07:56:58 +0000 <naval> 12/ ...and wash away our obsolete industrial-education system.
912224234075676672 2017-09-25 07:56:20 +0000 <naval> 11/ Eventually, the tide of the Internet and rational, self-interested employers will create and accept efficient credentialing...
912223590841331712 2017-09-25 07:53:47 +0000 <naval> 10/ Educational credentials are badges that admit one to the elite class. Expect elites to struggle mightily to justify the current system.
912222091251871745 2017-09-25 07:47:49 +0000 <naval> 9/ The tools for learning are abundant. It‚Äôs the desire to learn that‚Äôs scarce.
912222017700556800 2017-09-25 07:47:31 +0000 <naval> 8/ The best teachers are on the Internet. The best books are on the Internet. The best peers are on the Internet.
912221855053791232 2017-09-25 07:46:53 +0000 <naval> 7/ Even today, what to study and how to study it are more important than where to study it and for how long.
912221681141161984 2017-09-25 07:46:11 +0000 <naval> 6/ Until then, only the most desperate and talented students will make the leap.
912221530720919553 2017-09-25 07:45:35 +0000 <naval> 5/ A generation of auto-didacts, educated by the Internet &amp; leveraged by technology, will eventually starve the industrial-education system.
912221077438214144 2017-09-25 07:43:47 +0000 <naval> @ycombinator 4/ The more meritocratic an industry, the faster it moves away from false credentialing. I.e., the MBA and tech startups.
912220922177662977 2017-09-25 07:43:10 +0000 <naval> 3/ Employers looking past traditional credentials can arbitrage the gap. @ycombinator made $Bs doing this for young founders.
912220750060199936 2017-09-25 07:42:29 +0000 <naval> 2/ Schools survive anti-educational behavior (i.e. groupthink) due to symbiosis between institutions that issue and accept credentials.
912220382450524160 2017-09-25 07:41:02 +0000 <naval> 1/ If the primary purpose of school was education, the Internet should obsolete it. But school is mainly about credentialing.

908148329787170816 2017-09-14 02:00:09 +0000 <naval> @prestonjbyrne @rj_catalano @StopAndDecrypt Technology is good at taking large, expensive luxury goods and democratizing / atomizing them. Perhaps transactions &amp; contracts are next.

893889259093991424 2017-08-05 17:39:41 +0000 <naval> @playing4science Such a person would not appeal to authority, including their own. Their appeal would be falsifiable facts and methods with predictive power.

885912175038025728 2017-07-14 17:21:36 +0000 <naval> Twitter wish: a setting to let you approve / deny follow requests (without taking the whole account private or blocking people).
885898431826239489 2017-07-14 16:27:00 +0000 <naval> @MilindBansia If you say something that applies to everything said, did you say anything at all?
885892821298814977 2017-07-14 16:04:42 +0000 <naval> Religion, science, and spirituality help us make sense of the world. Life without at least one of them is a lonely and confusing place.

880487056291414016 2017-06-29 18:04:07 +0000 <naval> @nickwhite___ Blockchains can't store much data. They can store hashes that point to IPFS storage (see Filecoin) and perhaps critical bits like ID.

879115521471520768 2017-06-25 23:14:08 +0000 <naval> Twitter only goes back 3200 tweets so eventually tweetstorms slide into the dustbin.  https://t.co/NOZv4yJEcL

878838036586475520 2017-06-25 04:51:30 +0000 <naval> Blogs are like tweetstorms, but more long-winded, harder to share, and without per-sentence commentary.

878401215138234371 2017-06-23 23:55:44 +0000 <naval> Not liking how Twitter ranks replies on threads by blue checkmarks above others. Often the least on point. Attention seekers by definition.
878364706393554944 2017-06-23 21:30:39 +0000 <naval> @zaoyang It's the nature of reflexive markets that widely predicted become less likely to happen. Also important to define correction. 20%? 50%? 75%?

877473860609638400 2017-06-21 10:30:45 +0000 <naval> @mwilcox I know. But I was simplifying to make a point. And I was using the narrow definition of (financial) markets.
877471223369695232 2017-06-21 10:20:16 +0000 <naval> 36/ Ultimately, the nation-state is just a network (of networks).
877471146152574976 2017-06-21 10:19:58 +0000 <naval> 35/ Blockchain-based market networks will replace existing networks. Slowly, then suddenly. In one thing, then in many things.
877471091148570625 2017-06-21 10:19:45 +0000 <naval> 34/ Networks governed without kings, priests, elites, corporations and mobs. Networks governed by anyone with merit to the network.
877470995346366465 2017-06-21 10:19:22 +0000 <naval> 33/ Blockchains give us new ways to govern networks. For banking. For voting. For search. For social media. For phone and energy grids.
877470766249369601 2017-06-21 10:18:27 +0000 <naval> 32/ It's nonsensical to have a blockchain controlled by a sovereign, a corporation, an elite, or a mob.
877470691875987456 2017-06-21 10:18:10 +0000 <naval> 31/ It's nonsensical to have a blockchain without a coin just like it's nonsensical to have a market without money.
877470634678247424 2017-06-21 10:17:56 +0000 <naval> 30/ Blockchains' open and merit based markets can replace networks previously run by kings, corporations, aristocracies, and mobs.
877470539371102210 2017-06-21 10:17:33 +0000 <naval> 29/ Blockchains port the market model into places where it couldn't go before.
877470481481220096 2017-06-21 10:17:20 +0000 <naval> 28/ To a blockchain, merit can mean security, computation, prediction, attention, bandwidth, power, storage, distribution, content...
877470419720183810 2017-06-21 10:17:05 +0000 <naval> 27/ Blockchains combine the openness of democracy and the Internet with the merit of markets.
877470341760598016 2017-06-21 10:16:46 +0000 <naval> 26/ Bitcoin pays for securing the ledger. Etherium pays for (executing and verifying) computation.
877470093847912448 2017-06-21 10:15:47 +0000 <naval> 25/ Blockchains pay in coin, but the coin just tracks the work done. And different blockchains demand different work.
877469982577184768 2017-06-21 10:15:21 +0000 <naval> 24/ It's important to note that blockchains pay in their own coin, not the common (dollar) money of financial markets.
877469913593421824 2017-06-21 10:15:04 +0000 <naval> 23/ As society gives you money for giving society what it wants, blockchains give you coins for giving the network what it wants.
877469839803142144 2017-06-21 10:14:47 +0000 <naval> 22/ The meritorious are those who work to advance the network.
877469777978990592 2017-06-21 10:14:32 +0000 <naval> 21/They are merit-based, tamper-proof, open, voting systems.
877469715160903680 2017-06-21 10:14:17 +0000 <naval> 20/ Blockchains are a new invention that allows meritorious participants in an open network to govern without a ruler and without money.
877469645426393089 2017-06-21 10:14:00 +0000 <naval> 19/ Until now.
877469590179028992 2017-06-21 10:13:47 +0000 <naval> 18/ Market networks work where there is a commitment of money. Otherwise they are just mob networks. The applications are limited.
877469523338608641 2017-06-21 10:13:31 +0000 <naval> 17/ The market networks are titans. The credit markets. The stock markets. The commodities markets. The money markets. They break nations.
877469430841724929 2017-06-21 10:13:09 +0000 <naval> 16/ Merit in markets is determined by a commitment of resources. The resource is money, a form of frozen and trade-able time.
877469376848445440 2017-06-21 10:12:56 +0000 <naval> 15/ The 20th century created a new kind of network - market networks. Open AND meritocratic.
877469304412708864 2017-06-21 10:12:39 +0000 <naval> 14/ Dictatorships are more efficient in war than democracies. The Internet and physical commons are overloaded with abuse and spam.
877469246833307648 2017-06-21 10:12:25 +0000 <naval> 13/ A few are run by the mob. Democracy. The Internet. The commons. Open, but not meritocratic. And very inefficient.

877468715607924736 2017-06-21 10:10:19 +0000 <naval> 11/ Many are run by corporations. The social network. The search network. The phone or cable network. Closed but initially meritocratic.

864530786317254656 2017-05-16 17:19:36 +0000 <naval> @arvimango If a fish is injured, it knows not to use the affected part. Physical pain can easily exist without subjective suffering or cortex.
864528919805833216 2017-05-16 17:12:11 +0000 <naval> @arvimango Put another way, something resembling pain is adaptive and selected for. Humans who can't feel pain lose limbs (leprosy).

850506357161766913 2017-04-08 00:31:31 +0000 <naval> But big actors usually behave very rationally. Wars like WWI came from larger causes, not from shooting one ArchDuke.

850504823548121088 2017-04-08 00:25:26 +0000 <naval> It's a strategy that works most of the time but has blowup risk. So usually only employed by underdogs like NK and Iran.
850504613291864064 2017-04-08 00:24:36 +0000 <naval> Unfortunately, one stable equilibrium in geopolitics is to act irrationally while assuming that your opponent is rational.
850503124393635841 2017-04-08 00:18:41 +0000 <naval> Most people instinctively understand most game theory and play it rationally. The real lesson is that your opponents are playing it too.

824877976319782913 2017-01-27 07:13:29 +0000 <naval> @Aaron__FF Now everything except philosophy and science is boring. So read what you like. Eventually, you will read what you "should."
824877678494781442 2017-01-27 07:12:18 +0000 <naval> @Aaron__FF I started with comic books and sci-fi. Then I was into history and news. Then into psychology, popular science, technology.

810083678470754304 2016-12-17 11:26:14 +0000 <naval> The biggest fake news is that the "fake news" debate is about anything other than censorship.
810083410769281025 2016-12-17 11:25:10 +0000 <naval> @sheynk @AlexCartaz @je_mc2 The world isn't bipartisan. There are many many more viewpoints. Amazing to see people justifying censorship.
810082301463986176 2016-12-17 11:20:45 +0000 <naval> Patriot Act was our punishment for the state failing to stop 9/11. Social media censorship is our punishment for media failing to stop Trump

809988522396397569 2016-12-17 05:08:07 +0000 <naval> @Noahpinion @mikeydoubled @paul_btc It's not the sole explainer but S/D is a factor. Others may confound / override.
809986964090781696 2016-12-17 05:01:55 +0000 <naval> @artesesan Snopes and Politifact are not oracles of truth. They are politicized as well. Not every "problem" is prevalent or solvable.
809688255478140928 2016-12-16 09:14:58 +0000 <naval> @mikeydoubled @paul_btc Of course not. No single factor explains a complex system. Straw man.
809688059763490816 2016-12-16 09:14:11 +0000 <naval> @mikeydoubled @paul_btc The studies have other variables at play. Doesn't invalidate S/D. Thread started with Politifact calling S/D false!!
809687745668861952 2016-12-16 09:12:56 +0000 <naval> @mikeydoubled @paul_btc Why I stick to microeconomics. Macro is mostly politicized nonsense. Hard to make money when confused about basics.
809687408543342592 2016-12-16 09:11:36 +0000 <naval> @mikeydoubled @paul_btc But if you believe that a subset of studies with multiple variables, somehow invalidates S/D, good luck to you.
809687062416760833 2016-12-16 09:10:13 +0000 <naval> @mikeydoubled @paul_btc Not true. It's only in a few studies. Many confounding factors. Doesn't override common sense.
809685783309205505 2016-12-16 09:05:08 +0000 <naval> @mikeydoubled @paul_btc In an elastic demand scenario, increasing the minimum wage will cause a large change in quantity of labor demanded.
809685625980919808 2016-12-16 09:04:31 +0000 <naval> @mikeydoubled @paul_btc That means demand is elastic - small lowering of wage accommodates big increase in supply of labor.

806207105363415040 2016-12-06 18:42:07 +0000 <naval> @LDrogen Basic supply and demand is foundational. Here the empirical studies are flawed or looking at different systems.
806206902157742080 2016-12-06 18:41:18 +0000 <naval> @justinlabel The demand curve must be elastic or inelastic at a given point. Go ahead and sketch the one that makes both true.
806205708932788224 2016-12-06 18:36:34 +0000 <naval> @justinlabel No, because minimum wage and unskilled labor operate on the same part of the curve.

806192989424926720 2016-12-06 17:46:01 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes Pre-established and well understood rules. Change it for the next election.
806192849293217792 2016-12-06 17:45:28 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes Not according to the established rules of the game. Good luck to you üëç.

806191379281915904 2016-12-06 17:39:37 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes False equivalence.
806191013878300672 2016-12-06 17:38:10 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes Anyway, to each their own. It'll fail. Meanwhile, have fun playing with fire.
806190871016112128 2016-12-06 17:37:36 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes Read the first sentence in the article. Whole effort seems like sore losers trying to destroy the legitimacy of the ballot box.
806189686024638464 2016-12-06 17:32:54 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes Armed side supported Trump. Electors appointed by state legislatures, R controlled. Open this Pandora's box at your peril.
806189267726651392 2016-12-06 17:31:14 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes And given that 2/3 of state legislatures are R, what's to stop the Republicans from using electors to hold power in perpetuity?
806189069445144576 2016-12-06 17:30:27 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes The unarmed side in the debate should not be advocating for a coup.
806188959063625728 2016-12-06 17:30:00 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes If a small set of appointed people can override, it destroys the perceived legitimacy of the ballot box. Precursor to civil war.
806188151236460544 2016-12-06 17:26:48 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes Why have an election then? Just have the electors choose every time. Do away with the whole inefficient voting part.
806184905172365314 2016-12-06 17:13:54 +0000 <naval> @gbildson @shl @km @Harjeet Suggest examining supply / demand before positing far more convoluted and unlikely scenarios.

800791413432557568 2016-11-21 20:02:05 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes Yes. But on a per-user basis. Have to be very careful with global settings.
800789751984885760 2016-11-21 19:55:29 +0000 <naval> @je_mc2 Absolutely. But given how many now originate with journalistic outlets, how do you differentiate? Has to be bottoms up.
800786427206242308 2016-11-21 19:42:16 +0000 <naval> "Fake news" is clever branding. Sounds like it's about spam filtering but really about creating the apparatus to censor political speech.

800783089899212801 2016-11-21 19:29:01 +0000 <naval> @bitstein Agreed. Twitter is actually a well designed system. Credentials are conferred by the followers, not by the Elites.
800778196777996288 2016-11-21 19:09:34 +0000 <naval> 8/ A future society will be better served by un-censorable, distributed, open-source social media protocols.
800778154679799809 2016-11-21 19:09:24 +0000 <naval> 7/ What makes this even possible is that social media platforms are controlled by "benevolent dictators."

800777970818301953 2016-11-21 19:08:40 +0000 <naval> 3/ If by consensus, you'd have to let people vote, distribute, and annotate. The winners would be the most popular. Sounds like Twitter...
800777848080371714 2016-11-21 19:08:11 +0000 <naval> 2/ Algorithms are just another way of saying "by experts (programmers)"

751687178942459904 2016-07-09 07:59:23 +0000 <naval> @AbiTyasTunggal Yes, reading gives frameworks to map onto experience. So my (trite) advice would be to read - nonfiction, source materials.

751508214596837376 2016-07-08 20:08:15 +0000 <naval> 16/16: Far future: In a perfect Virtual Reality world, we all live in governments of one. Fin.
751508037567848448 2016-07-08 20:07:33 +0000 <naval> 15/ Future: Remaining violence is mostly secessionist / self determinist in nature. Expect many more smaller states.
751507835716984834 2016-07-08 20:06:45 +0000 <naval> 14/ Future: Money becomes information. Weapons become information. Land becomes information. Software eats society.
751507558691516416 2016-07-08 20:05:38 +0000 <naval> 13/ Information Age: Virtual Reality worlds create infinite land. Returns to conquering territory declines further.
751507476504121344 2016-07-08 20:05:19 +0000 <naval> 12/ Information Age: Rise of mental labor over physical labor reduces returns to conquering people and territories.
751507293515030528 2016-07-08 20:04:35 +0000 <naval> 10/ Info Age: Miniaturized drones will render battlefield systems obsolete. Dominates aircraft, infantry, armor. Trivializes assassinations.
751507227383439360 2016-07-08 20:04:19 +0000 <naval> 9/ Info Age: Connected cameras. Every violent action filmed and broadcast. Returns to violence decline (except terrorism, where they rise).
751506943093542912 2016-07-08 20:03:12 +0000 <naval> 8/ Info Age: Guns become trivial to create &amp; distribute. 3D Printing becomes Printing Press for guns. Ease of offense &amp; defense increase.
751506867625439232 2016-07-08 20:02:54 +0000 <naval> 7/ Information Age: Tectonic shifts in costs of violence and returns to violence on horizon.
751506765909364736 2016-07-08 20:02:29 +0000 <naval> 6/ Nuclear Age: Nuclear weapons create Mutually-Assured-Destruction. Large-scale peace and small-scale war. Rule by Superpowers
751506688180531200 2016-07-08 20:02:11 +0000 <naval> 5/ Industrial Age:  Armies with guns and vulnerable factories require consolidation of power. Rule by Nation-states
751506602524499968 2016-07-08 20:01:51 +0000 <naval> 4/ Agricultural age: Land &amp; possessions emerge, hard to defend. Feudal lords run protection racket, hierarchical society. Rule by Kings.
751506465601441792 2016-07-08 20:01:18 +0000 <naval> 3/ Hunter gatherer age: No land, no possessions, axes and spears. Rule by Tribes
751506255022174208 2016-07-08 20:00:28 +0000 <naval> 2/ It is easier to take than to create. Social structure emerges from the predator-prey relationship between makers and takers.

750805075673518080 2016-07-06 21:34:13 +0000 <naval> @karmsingh @shervin That should have consequences. Point is that Alton &amp; everyone like him should have a bodycam too. No need to trust cops.
750804797255671808 2016-07-06 21:33:07 +0000 <naval> @semil @shervin Needs small, long-battery, clip-mounted, dedicated hardware with a single panic button. Phone form factor is all wrong.

749343956475916290 2016-07-02 20:48:16 +0000 <naval> @AlexanderDSoSo @balajis Obviously not. Just saying that your only choices are mob rule, violence or exit. Thus, the sanctity of exit.
749340443238739969 2016-07-02 20:34:18 +0000 <naval> @AlexanderDSoSo @balajis "Educated and informed" are codewords for "thinks like me." They're perfectly rational, just  different from you.

743215801453281280 2016-06-15 22:57:10 +0000 <naval> @pm Most journalists are in a full scale war against Trump. But their bosses likely want Trump coverage rather than blackout.
743185309412659200 2016-06-15 20:56:00 +0000 <naval> @Varun Information networks like Twitter are powerful network-effect driven monopolies. Nearly impossible to displace without platform shift

743181743579029505 2016-06-15 20:41:49 +0000 <naval> @Varun Free speech is more important than right to not be offended. Sticks and stones may...

632680768678920192 2015-08-15 22:30:24 +0000 <naval> @jrecursive nailed it. Could explain why meditation is harder than daydreaming.
632677695571124224 2015-08-15 22:18:11 +0000 <naval> @naval Maybe because alertness requires neuromuscular focus, more taxing than running a simulation.
632676317310222336 2015-08-15 22:12:43 +0000 <naval> Surprisingly, it takes less mental energy to daydream than it does to stay alert.

626561401935388672 2015-07-30 01:14:13 +0000 <naval> @johnolilly Your brand strength would accelerate. But adverse selection is the enemy. More likely at earliest stages from the accelerator 6%
626561230405120000 2015-07-30 01:13:32 +0000 <naval> @johnolilly I'd rather raise money from Greylock if I cross-pollinate with its portfolio. But you'd have to "force" it.
626560954684149760 2015-07-30 01:12:27 +0000 <naval> @johnolilly Right, so accelerators and investors should provide "modest diversification as a service".
626560603067322368 2015-07-30 01:11:03 +0000 <naval> Rough (1st pass) AngelList data indicates that startup salaries are way up but equity grants are flat. What gives, founders?
626560213080879104 2015-07-30 01:09:30 +0000 <naval> @peter Yes, part of the trend. And that liquidity is being invested back in other startups.
626560107199881216 2015-07-30 01:09:05 +0000 <naval> @johnolilly Even a small amount (2%-5% of founder equity) would be good.
626559962894893056 2015-07-30 01:08:30 +0000 <naval> Accelerators could pool and redistribute equity within a given class to combat increasingly extreme outcomes. (also see @upsidevc )
626559506768490497 2015-07-30 01:06:41 +0000 <naval> Note how successful entrepreneurs are increasingly open studios, search funds, and incubators. They intuit the new math.
626559288685625344 2015-07-30 01:05:49 +0000 <naval> Investors like founders to be "all-in" but with outcomes becoming more extreme, that argument is increasingly unfair.
626559017393876992 2015-07-30 01:04:45 +0000 <naval> Consequence of increased technology leverage - mean founder outcome better, but median outcome worse. Rational founders should diversify.
626558609107750912 2015-07-30 01:03:07 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes Mean founder is better off. Median founder is worse off (increased leverage creates more extreme outcomes).
626557501526310912 2015-07-30 00:58:43 +0000 <naval> @KevinSimler @ben_mathes Great read. "Quantum physics is not "weird".  You are weird."
626321936801361920 2015-07-29 09:22:40 +0000 <naval> @barticz @AngelList will check in morning and fix for you.
626305742602043392 2015-07-29 08:18:19 +0000 <naval> The majority of surplus from increased technology leverage goes to founders, since a hot startup is more differentiated than a hot investor.
626303118666412032 2015-07-29 08:07:54 +0000 <naval> One (of many reasons) that valuations are up is that founders are capturing most of the surplus created by increased technology leverage.
626301860098387968 2015-07-29 08:02:54 +0000 <naval> No points for predicting that this time will end just like last time. The information value in a prediction is proportional to the surprise.

604778445969563648 2015-05-30 22:36:32 +0000 <naval> @bradcumbers @StartupLJackson Which is why we teach it. We consider it foundational literacy. I'm saying that CS is the next such skill.

597479563455639553 2015-05-10 19:13:23 +0000 <naval> @teddiew @hkanji @hunterwalk Exactly.
597479425370816513 2015-05-10 19:12:50 +0000 <naval> @teddiew @hkanji @hunterwalk I think I'm talking about micro-seed Funds and you're talking about larger funds.
597479302024724480 2015-05-10 19:12:20 +0000 <naval> @teddiew @hkanji @hunterwalk I'm accounting for that. A $5M fund (equivalent to a syndicate) can and should charge more than 2% fee.
597478586333835264 2015-05-10 19:09:30 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @teddiew @hunterwalk Anytime we've offered pooled funds, Backers vote for opt-out (with their money).
597478349376630784 2015-05-10 19:08:33 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @teddiew @hunterwalk Anyway, we will do pooled / net carry, but those Backers will give up opt-out. Won't be that popular.
597478129821585410 2015-05-10 19:07:41 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @teddiew @hunterwalk Give up the fees, put some capital down, come start a syndicate :-) Or run one side by side.
597477918156066816 2015-05-10 19:06:50 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @teddiew @hunterwalk Distributions paying back fees doesn't change anything. And we are taking drop downs into account.
597476211825123328 2015-05-10 19:00:04 +0000 <naval> @teddiew @hkanji @hunterwalk Smaller the fund, higher the fees. That's normal and justified.
597475980530167808 2015-05-10 18:59:08 +0000 <naval> @teddiew @hkanji @hunterwalk I'm saying 20%-25% for seed funds. Recycling is small fraction or way down line. Even at 15% the argument holds
597475386012749824 2015-05-10 18:56:47 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily Nobody puts 100% of fees into fund. If they did, why have fees? Just have more carry.
597474149074735104 2015-05-10 18:51:52 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily And yet your model shows negligible differences. We'll post our model soon.
597474030162022401 2015-05-10 18:51:23 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily Uh... Fee recycling doesn't work like that. And our Deal Carry is lower. And seed fund fees are higher.
597460981220909056 2015-05-10 17:59:32 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily all depends on assumptions. Our models show better returns for syndicates. But, whatever your LPs are up for
597454981835272192 2015-05-10 17:35:42 +0000 <naval> @Kevrmoore Hard requirements can lead to adverse selection, which is problematic when the outcomes are power law distributed.
597453394169626624 2015-05-10 17:29:23 +0000 <naval> @Kevrmoore Keep in mind that lead co-investment is tricky. VCs collect fees so have a negative commitment, if comparing apples to apples.
597452788679839745 2015-05-10 17:26:59 +0000 <naval> @Kevrmoore @hkanji But it's an open system. Others have different parameters. All transparent.
597452619750055936 2015-05-10 17:26:19 +0000 <naval> @Kevrmoore @hkanji That's basically how I run mine, 15% carry, 0 fee, 5%-10% real GP commit. Updates are up to company.
597443222676185088 2015-05-10 16:48:58 +0000 <naval> @ckemper @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily I'm comparing to Syndicates, which are extremely tiny funds, $5M fund equivalent.
597443076886401024 2015-05-10 16:48:24 +0000 <naval> @ckemper @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily Accelerator funds can be up to 50%. Larger funds start reducing down to the range you mention.
597442579014160384 2015-05-10 16:46:25 +0000 <naval> @ckemper @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily Seed funds are higher. The smaller the fund, the higher the fees. Mine were about 25% total.
597439489657540608 2015-05-10 16:34:08 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily it's the performance that matters. I get that VCs on Twitter prefer the VC model. Got it.
597438762830794753 2015-05-10 16:31:15 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily Some LPs think fees are the raw deal. Opacity, lock ups, no opt outs are raw deals.  https://t.co/Xnb3EowdzO
597438412744839168 2015-05-10 16:29:52 +0000 <naval> @hkanji @hunterwalk @PandoDaily We have. Don't forget to hold back 25% for fees and only invest 75% inVC model.
597206861327142912 2015-05-10 01:09:45 +0000 <naval> @dcurtis @semil @rsg @mattocko Not quite. It's a spectrum. Access, insight, luck, timing, location, leverage, brand. All in a witch's brew.
597206496292646913 2015-05-10 01:08:18 +0000 <naval> @dcurtis @semil @rsg @mattocko At seed stage, you can eliminate losers, but very hard to pick winners.
597206373143683072 2015-05-10 01:07:49 +0000 <naval> @dcurtis @semil @rsg @mattocko Much more of this business is dumb luck and "right place, right time" than anyone cares to admit.
597201704791113728 2015-05-10 00:49:16 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko And we will show 100% tracked track records, down to the penny. Anyone abusing the model will be out of business, forever.
597201558850285568 2015-05-10 00:48:41 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko I hear you, pooled carry coming. But most Backers want opt-out, and that means they will choose Syndicates over Funds.
597198674960130048 2015-05-10 00:37:14 +0000 <naval> @mattocko @rsg Sorry, just sick of Twitter drive by shootings. We've hashed this exact topic out before.
597198389910982658 2015-05-10 00:36:06 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko Add up GP Contribution. Subtract Fees. Divide total into LP Contribution. "Divide by zero error."
597197470091780097 2015-05-10 00:32:26 +0000 <naval> @dcurtis @semil @rsg @mattocko That would be true if anyone knew what the top 30% were, in advance. In practice, much harder.
597197203296243712 2015-05-10 00:31:23 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko if you don't like the trade, don't invest. Many like it. Stop patronizing them.
597197117937950720 2015-05-10 00:31:02 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko Again, the key is that Syndicates trades pooled carry for no fees, opt out capability, no lockin, full transparency.
597196806015979520 2015-05-10 00:29:48 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko it's far less than the infinite leverage on VC funds. Compare apples to apples.
597196478776352768 2015-05-10 00:28:30 +0000 <naval> @dcurtis @semil @rsg @mattocko Correct. Majority of good deals are private. I run all of my deals privately...
597196057634701312 2015-05-10 00:26:50 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko Anyone running too many deals sees their backer support crumble. It's very quick. People aren't morons.
597195938239619073 2015-05-10 00:26:21 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko We monitor every deal. If we think someone is abusing or running too many deals we stop them. Backers punish them instantly.
597195552107827201 2015-05-10 00:24:49 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko What's the annual management fee across all funds at a big fund, anyway? Salary per partner? Let's talk incentives.
597195275657039873 2015-05-10 00:23:43 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko Is classic Venture the only model allowed? How about 7% to accelerators?
597195153049157633 2015-05-10 00:23:14 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko Are you going after deal carry late-stage SPVs? Secondaries with counterparty risk?
597194856037912576 2015-05-10 00:22:03 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko Anyway, pooled carry funds are on platform and more coming. Once all of those are launched, will you go after VCs for fees?
597194291492954112 2015-05-10 00:19:49 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko if you don't like it, don't use it. It's fully transparent. Agree to disagree.
597194194050895872 2015-05-10 00:19:25 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko Infinite leverage in VC (once you subtract fees), and yet fixate on pooled v deal carry.
597194041856397313 2015-05-10 00:18:49 +0000 <naval> @rsg @mattocko Amazing to me that you overlook all of VC model shortcomings - fees, negative GP contribution, lockup, 0 transparency...
596931819095732224 2015-05-09 06:56:50 +0000 <naval> @SergeyNazarov We are not evolved to be happy. But we are operating far from our evolved environment. See  http://t.co/xHkdHS1af6

596848222959603712 2015-05-09 01:24:39 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk @tedr @chudson In a weird way, it re-energized me to kick ass.

596845351132209152 2015-05-09 01:13:15 +0000 <naval> @tedr @chudson So true - I woke up this morning to two Twitter drive bys.
596787627245768704 2015-05-08 21:23:52 +0000 <naval> @naval Add in the narrative that "anyone can be the next Zuck / Musk" makes you feel bad about yourself.
596787414858731520 2015-05-08 21:23:02 +0000 <naval> @naval My personal pet theory is that "co-opetition" creates cognitive dissonance and traps us in non-genuine relationships.
596786358565220352 2015-05-08 21:18:50 +0000 <naval> @clubdinein Across the street from our office :-)
596785970126540800 2015-05-08 21:17:17 +0000 <naval> A friend who was very successful elsewhere and recently moved here, commented "people here [in Silicon Valley] don't seem very happy."
596782693766995968 2015-05-08 21:04:16 +0000 <naval> @devahaz @fmanjoo @rabois @hunterwalk But potshots at deal carry w/o seeing no fees, transparency, skin in game, and opt outs are misleading
596782331429421057 2015-05-08 21:02:50 +0000 <naval> @devahaz @fmanjoo @rabois @hunterwalk And first model has 10-year lockup, no transparency, no chance GP can lose. Apples and oranges.
596781590480457728 2015-05-08 20:59:53 +0000 <naval> @devahaz @fmanjoo @rabois @hunterwalk Not apples to apples. Remove 25% for fees from first model. Then lower carry on 2nd model to 15%.
596775596828467200 2015-05-08 20:36:04 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk Thanks, but a link-bait headline ;-)
596728837200695296 2015-05-08 17:30:16 +0000 <naval> @JohnTRhoads Not at the expense of controlling them. Backers want choice.
596726085980590081 2015-05-08 17:19:20 +0000 <naval> @JohnTRhoads Makes product, messaging, accounting very complex. But we are working on it.
596725706513453056 2015-05-08 17:17:49 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk @nedwin Yup. Was just pointing out that pro-rata is given to a GP or a Lead, not to an LP or Backer. Can't compare GP to Backer.
596717038447407105 2015-05-08 16:43:23 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk @nedwin Sure - then VCs and seed funds should give it up too.
596716756258791424 2015-05-08 16:42:15 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk 7) Backers can stop investing anytime. Not completely locked up like LPs.
596715923072942080 2015-05-08 16:38:57 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk 6) Pooled carry is coming to AL. But it requires Backers to give up opt-out, so will be less popular than some think.
596715723998629889 2015-05-08 16:38:09 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk 5) Syndicate Backers deserve pro-rata at least as much as VC's passive LPs do.
596715628263702528 2015-05-08 16:37:46 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk 4) Remove deal-by-deal and opt-in / opt-out goes away too.
596715556637511680 2015-05-08 16:37:29 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk 3) Deal by deal carry is lower on average (15, not 20-25) and is the flip side of Backer being able to opt out of any deal.
596715410734452736 2015-05-08 16:36:55 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk 2) VC GP contributions / skin in the game are *negative.* 25% in fees and 1%-5% GP contribution is -20% in "skin in game."
596715165569155072 2015-05-08 16:35:56 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk 1) No fees 95 cents on dollar invested instead of 70 cents on dollar invested. Bigger pie for everyone.
596026417122410496 2015-05-06 18:59:06 +0000 <naval> @nikillinit @Besvinick People have been saying that since 1995. In my experience, algorithmically curated crowd always crushes experts.
596024969571610624 2015-05-06 18:53:21 +0000 <naval> @Besvinick The original "do everything" text interface -  http://t.co/2uMPSRqJZk
596024504725282817 2015-05-06 18:51:30 +0000 <naval> @aac A display isn't a bad thing, but it can't be the main selling point.
596024254279258113 2015-05-06 18:50:30 +0000 <naval> @Besvinick I find that these "expert curated" and "text interface" systems eventually lose out to crowd curated and structured (i.e. @Yelp )
596021257792925696 2015-05-06 18:38:36 +0000 <naval> The winning wearable won't need a display - but it will need a compelling package of sensors that aren't feasible on a phone.
595009850116939776 2015-05-03 23:39:37 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes But more do, as a proportion, than laborers and peasants did. By far. And the ruling classes come from within the "labor."
595000508898619392 2015-05-03 23:02:30 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes too pessimistic. They have a shot at nonlinear returns and to be founders / VCs. Non-coders have it worse. Code + Sales = Magic.
594999089084805120 2015-05-03 22:56:52 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes much less, I'm afraid.
594987779618054144 2015-05-03 22:11:55 +0000 <naval> The iPhone wasn't a better phone, it was the first viable pocket computer. Extrapolating from phones, watches, wallets, glasses is an error.
594962828835954688 2015-05-03 20:32:46 +0000 <naval> @StartupLJackson Sure, you can live without it, just like it's possible to stumble through life without a working knowledge of mathematics.

594005620166111232 2015-05-01 05:09:10 +0000 <naval> @hunterwalk Twitter is only hard to replace because it already exists. If it was shut down, a replacement would hit critical mass quickly.

593573319384834048 2015-04-30 00:31:22 +0000 <naval> @joestump Maybe @Postmates or equivalent will replace them someday for last mile.

593566067617730560 2015-04-30 00:02:33 +0000 <naval> @jpramey Right, trade-off between speed that leads want and opt-out that Backers want. Still experimenting with time period.
593553415420055552 2015-04-29 23:12:16 +0000 <naval> @jpramey And finally there's this solution:  https://t.co/5y4L7tR5Pk

593553234872049664 2015-04-29 23:11:33 +0000 <naval> @jpramey It's something we are struggling with - more and more leads and founders want private deals. Back some high quality leads, pre-fund
593549296160538624 2015-04-29 22:55:54 +0000 <naval> @jpramey Many of the best deals are Private to accepted and Funded Backers only.

509911335212052480 2014-09-11 03:48:30 +0000 <naval> @semil that deal number is too conservative, but otherwise good :-)
508854071155904512 2014-09-08 05:47:19 +0000 <naval> @YangTerrence A lot of the best deals are privately syndicated - you have to be backing the syndicator to see them.
508804879801139200 2014-09-08 02:31:51 +0000 <naval> @rsg We are starting to do it. Top leads already have 10-deal funds forming on AL. Obvious next step.
508803142319083521 2014-09-08 02:24:56 +0000 <naval> @rsg @aten Can't assume Backers back one lead for many deals. Most Backers back many deals and many leads. They like to choose deal by deal.
508802565375803393 2014-09-08 02:22:39 +0000 <naval> @rsg @aten forcing fund would mean barrier to entry goes up 10x. And backers locked in. Skin in game and transparency are aligners
508802098293932032 2014-09-08 02:20:47 +0000 <naval> @semil @rsg And even known leads flop when pushing mediocre deals. The market is transparent and the backers choose.
508800187993960448 2014-09-08 02:13:12 +0000 <naval> @rsg the "2" is 2x10=20 off the top, only 80 invested.. Syndicate equivalent is 0 fee, 100 invested.
508799944300691456 2014-09-08 02:12:14 +0000 <naval> @rsg I was a VC and got away with zero skin in game + mgmt fees... It was a good deal ;-)
508799658232385536 2014-09-08 02:11:06 +0000 <naval> @rsg agreed. It's nuanced. We made one sub-optimal trade off for ~5 benefits. Backers seem to prefer it but not perfect.
508798794696503296 2014-09-08 02:07:40 +0000 <naval> @rsg Large VCs have management fees. Syndicates have none. Opposite - they have mandatory skin in the game. And all money gets put to work.
508797155247923200 2014-09-08 02:01:09 +0000 <naval> @rsg online. Happy to discuss offline. Twitter is not the right venue anyway.
508797085488275456 2014-09-08 02:00:52 +0000 <naval> @rsg we could move to net carry but that would mean Backers are locked into long haul, money up front across 4 yrs of deals. Wouldn't work
508796686677069824 2014-09-08 01:59:17 +0000 <naval> @rsg on raw percentage terms. So it's not perfect but better than status quo.
508796595522248706 2014-09-08 01:58:56 +0000 <naval> @rsg Lead deals are also 100% transparent. Add in no management fees, required skin in game, disclose conflicts. They also charge low carry
508796364567105537 2014-09-08 01:58:00 +0000 <naval> @rsg Syndicates are deal by deal. But flip side is that backers can evaluate individual deals and opt out. They can fire leads with 1 click.

466553020650901504 2014-05-14 12:18:02 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes Thus, the disclaimer :-)
466548960996651009 2014-05-14 12:01:55 +0000 <naval> @koolhead17 It is great.
466547913326624769 2014-05-14 11:57:45 +0000 <naval> Corollary: on a long enough timeline, all essential software and network infrastructure goes open-source.
466546334703828992 2014-05-14 11:51:28 +0000 <naval> @asmartbear agreed, I'm just saying that Medium may be swimming upstream here.
466545847350870016 2014-05-14 11:49:32 +0000 <naval> @asmartbear We shall see. Medium v Wordpress is such an attempt.
466545567443996673 2014-05-14 11:48:25 +0000 <naval> @asmartbear Talking about networks, software, protocols... Business aggregation is very common.
466545286832463872 2014-05-14 11:47:19 +0000 <naval> @asmartbear It's not about prevention, it's about irreversibility.
466545042853998592 2014-05-14 11:46:20 +0000 <naval> @asmartbear My thesis is not that it inevitably wins, but once it does, it's a permanent victory.
466544943335747584 2014-05-14 11:45:57 +0000 <naval> @asmartbear BitTorrent continues to dominate where it had a foothold. If someone builds a BT that works for simple folder syncing...
466543365035933696 2014-05-14 11:39:40 +0000 <naval> @DWebbny The web. Email. Server-Side Linux. MySQL. Chromium.
466542522995441664 2014-05-14 11:36:20 +0000 <naval> The trend towards decentralized, open systems is strictly one-way. It doesn't always happen, but when it does, it's irreversible.
466175504223973377 2014-05-13 11:17:55 +0000 <naval> @kyron777 it'll be encrypted at the router level.
466173725583216640 2014-05-13 11:10:51 +0000 <naval> Every packet will eventually be encrypted and peer-routed.
465753594910605312 2014-05-12 07:21:24 +0000 <naval> @tferriss Great post. I get important things done as I run inbox zero and get to them eventually, but should prioritize better.
465632594822852608 2014-05-11 23:20:36 +0000 <naval> @j_venator Doubt it, should be up to company.
465629454971043840 2014-05-11 23:08:07 +0000 <naval> @j_venator No, Company signs a side letter with the syndicate authorizing it.

464493206252830721 2014-05-08 19:53:04 +0000 <naval> @mp3michael I'm comparing team of engs building the same site. Now 1 founder can do what it took 1 founder + 14 eng employees.

464482066802167808 2014-05-08 19:08:49 +0000 <naval> @mp3michael for the same simple web app from 1999. Ok, so it's $50K or $500K. Basic point stands :-)
464286167827902464 2014-05-08 06:10:23 +0000 <naval> @sbermo No, you're right in that interest graph is more accurate but maybe less universally understood of a term.
464282643614269440 2014-05-08 05:56:22 +0000 <naval> @HHolen True on LI, but low engagement means I'm open to switching out the graph.
464281199092191232 2014-05-08 05:50:38 +0000 <naval> Friend graphs (FB, LI) are declining in strategic value as mobile contact list takes over. Stranger graphs (IG, TWTR) maintain full value.
463936975750193153 2014-05-07 07:02:49 +0000 <naval> @timgaweco @pmarca If you can't decide, the answer is "no." Good decisions should have deep conviction associated with them. Take your time.

463851333594796032 2014-05-07 01:22:30 +0000 <naval> @pmarca Related - successful entrepreneurs create incubators and labs, institutionalize their fear of commitment.
463851109774143488 2014-05-07 01:21:37 +0000 <naval> @pmarca Greed pulls - tech business always creating new shiny objects. Fear pushes - startups face failure every day.

462488972547993600 2014-05-03 07:08:58 +0000 <naval> @pmarca @Mc_Huge Bingo. First, they laugh at you.
462488079039594497 2014-05-03 07:05:25 +0000 <naval> @pmarca @mattocko It'll happen organically as we decentralize identity, payments, and routing. An entire industry will drive the change.
462487572527067136 2014-05-03 07:03:24 +0000 <naval> @anshublog @pmarca No, it's still controlled. No deep linking, must use App Store, iTunes payments, etc.
462487157035122688 2014-05-03 07:01:45 +0000 <naval> @pmarca Maybe that's it then. Use open SIMs, fork Android, and open / standardize all of the proprietary Google bits.
462484731284570112 2014-05-03 06:52:07 +0000 <naval> @pmarca fork and truly open Android.
462484624275304448 2014-05-03 06:51:41 +0000 <naval> @pmarca Don't we need carriers to deploy an open phone? Permission-based, subsidized wireless networks...
462483630590160896 2014-05-03 06:47:44 +0000 <naval> @pmarca but now you require an open mobile browser, an open mobile OS, an open carrier, and open hardware. Activation energy is high.
462483417909583872 2014-05-03 06:46:54 +0000 <naval> @pmarca True. The browser was a toy. Linux was a toy. The dominant mobile browsers needs to separate from the dominant mobile OSs.
462482312723058690 2014-05-03 06:42:30 +0000 <naval> @pmarca Or perhaps we should create a new one. The Linux / Firefox of Mobile.

462481727907049473 2014-05-03 06:40:11 +0000 <naval> @pmarca Hardware, network, battery. I fear that this may take a while.
462481075453702144 2014-05-03 06:37:35 +0000 <naval> @pmarca Most needed infrastructure innovation of our time.
462480934810300416 2014-05-03 06:37:02 +0000 <naval> @pmarca Inevitable, but only when hardware is so powerful that performance benefits from vertical integration don't matter as much.

431481177539497984 2014-02-06 17:35:03 +0000 <naval> @apsinkus You are not understanding. There is NO fee for posting. It's only if there's a successful hire and 1/3 of what recruiters charge.
431476619601903617 2014-02-06 17:16:57 +0000 <naval> @apsinkus there's no fee for posting, that's only on a successful hire.

421504743077191680 2014-01-10 04:52:16 +0000 <naval> @Reuven @cdixon @fdestin Impossible. The playback mechanism has to decrypt the file.
421424328249315328 2014-01-09 23:32:44 +0000 <naval> @andrewlockhart @angellist @Tinder This is a real problem? :-) Can always filter heavily, by popularity, keyword, salary, etc...
421364959134490624 2014-01-09 19:36:49 +0000 <naval> @rodolfor "From press releases and conference calls"
421364113986433024 2014-01-09 19:33:28 +0000 <naval> @balajis @agilemofo @cdixon IMHO just gimmicks. For business uses, you want guaranteed undo, which is physically impossible.
421049086003789824 2014-01-08 22:41:39 +0000 <naval> @balajis Related - Bitmessage promise of full encryption and anonymous sender and recipient is interesting. Would love to see it implemented
421041621996535808 2014-01-08 22:11:59 +0000 <naval> @braunshizzle @angellist It'll be back when we can focus more resources on it...
420708494396776448 2014-01-08 00:08:16 +0000 <naval> @jayzalowitz @howardlindzon @marting @Jason @fredwilson Yes.
420705483452727296 2014-01-07 23:56:18 +0000 <naval> @marting @howardlindzon @Jason @fredwilson yes, stand by.
420700344503377921 2014-01-07 23:35:53 +0000 <naval> @Jason @fredwilson Already do this, just need to clean it up a bit and add portability UI. Free for all investors.
420655603300569088 2014-01-07 20:38:05 +0000 <naval> @QuintinAdamis used to, now defunct. Startups had existing lawyers who always wanted to customize.
420630317435592704 2014-01-07 18:57:37 +0000 <naval> @jasoncrawford @avc @fredwilson Yes, we do free, portable, all-online 506b and 506c accreditation for all investors. Will post on it shortly
420408419426631681 2014-01-07 04:15:52 +0000 <naval> @daveambrose @angellist team-at-angel-co - sorry about that, will take a look.
419896406531256320 2014-01-05 18:21:19 +0000 <naval> @CynthiaSchames Cheaper than all of the competition - and equity option for those without cash.
419885697344876544 2014-01-05 17:38:46 +0000 <naval> @CynthiaSchames @angellist Very recently, right now of new job postings only.

416483468017545216 2013-12-27 08:19:31 +0000 <naval> @lhaderdor We tell the companies to include everyone who made a reservation before the target amount was hit.
415602443318071296 2013-12-24 21:58:38 +0000 <naval> @itschrstn @angellist email us team@...
415212744833368064 2013-12-23 20:10:07 +0000 <naval> @kathrynhawkins Thanks, BTW AngelList is mostly free. The 5% only crops up for funds collected online and is % of profits, not investment.
414548640972017664 2013-12-22 00:11:12 +0000 <naval> @theBetaGuy Supports most English-speaking countries but certain parts only work in certain countries (regulatory constraints)
414098059006451713 2013-12-20 18:20:45 +0000 <naval> @virtualkenji @anthemos need to do both. Usually, the best candidates have to be approached first, with custom notes and a great profile.
412993134306406400 2013-12-17 17:10:10 +0000 <naval> @HugoAmsellem Not sure what that is?
412993061644292096 2013-12-17 17:09:53 +0000 <naval> @bryanshepard thanks, on it. Cc @milliemay
412701858436624384 2013-12-16 21:52:45 +0000 <naval> @SteffanHowey What's the issue Steffan? More detail please?
411853498850881536 2013-12-14 13:41:40 +0000 <naval> @parkparadigm @AAinslie @keithie it is more like gold but IMHO very long term I think it'll be fine as a currency as well.
411853263877574656 2013-12-14 13:40:44 +0000 <naval> @parkparadigm @AAinslie @keithie All currencies are deflationary relative to investment opportunities, ie stock market. It's a complex topic
411619208078696448 2013-12-13 22:10:41 +0000 <naval> Intentions don't matter. Actions do. That's why being ethical is hard.
411593822120865792 2013-12-13 20:29:48 +0000 <naval> @aayush let there be light :-)
411518497043124225 2013-12-13 15:30:30 +0000 <naval> @StartupLJackson @eranshir Agreed; Was mostly meant as advice to otherwise distributed, open source projects.
411517963913555968 2013-12-13 15:28:22 +0000 <naval> @zooko But creator can keep a monopoly on mining for the first 10%, then release the software, no?
411517397594427392 2013-12-13 15:26:07 +0000 <naval> @gercheq @KilianM it's unlikely, but in information goods, anything is possible.
411436905171910656 2013-12-13 10:06:16 +0000 <naval> @gercheq @KilianM and no, I'm not early. It's a very recent thing.
411436814499463168 2013-12-13 10:05:55 +0000 <naval> @gercheq @KilianM it's going 100x or to zero from here. Still a binary outcome at the end.
411435115772776448 2013-12-13 09:59:10 +0000 <naval> Living things are those things which replicate, adapt, and locally reverse entropy.
411433878193057793 2013-12-13 09:54:15 +0000 <naval> @utekkare They're not competing - each can power a different use case. But ones that power the same use case do compete.
411421465469145088 2013-12-13 09:04:55 +0000 <naval> @kangasbros open source finally has an open, built-in business model.
411382257505411072 2013-12-13 06:29:07 +0000 <naval> @eileentso @Sigalow Ownership is the easier one. It's the squeezing out angels that I fine unconscionable.
411377397661855744 2013-12-13 06:09:49 +0000 <naval> @LenKendall Unfortunately true, but Syndicates are young and Chicago is under-represented, for now.
411321969368252416 2013-12-13 02:29:34 +0000 <naval> I'd pay extra for @amazon Prime without Ontrac - they are wrecking Amazon's brand. Have yet to see Ontrac deliver on time.
411279859969585153 2013-12-12 23:42:14 +0000 <naval> @dideler @angellist No (email may have gone out) but if they respond, just tell them it was a mis-click. Our system is very "live."
411269760580452352 2013-12-12 23:02:06 +0000 <naval> @Sigalow Both great things. You should put this on your front page. More people need to know.
411262637658214401 2013-12-12 22:33:48 +0000 <naval> @sir I hope so. That's what transparency usually does. But people are afraid to speak up.
411261311494787072 2013-12-12 22:28:32 +0000 <naval> @overdrev @jberrebi Angels should get and enforce pro-rata. And shut out VCs who squeeze Angels out. It can be solved by transparency.
411261128996421632 2013-12-12 22:27:48 +0000 <naval> @sir People turn / change. It's shocking.
411260977762426880 2013-12-12 22:27:12 +0000 <naval> @sir I'm a founder. I've raised money. I would not let a newcomer squeeze the existing. It's basic ethics.
411256282511708160 2013-12-12 22:08:33 +0000 <naval> @chraynaud @jberrebi Nowhere near as much. A usually has contractual pro-rata rights. Angels often don't.
411256104937484288 2013-12-12 22:07:50 +0000 <naval> Any VCs out there who don't squeeze angels out of pro-rata when doing deals? Please RT - I'd like a show of hands.
411255138842447872 2013-12-12 22:04:00 +0000 <naval> @adaugelli They're both culpable, IMHO, but usually starts with Venture pressure.
411254827226640385 2013-12-12 22:02:46 +0000 <naval> @jberrebi Agreed, but founders shouldn't go along. It's their deal. Do the honorable thing.
411254427484307456 2013-12-12 22:01:10 +0000 <naval> @adaugelli Perhaps. These days, most VCs will gladly squeeze people out for that extra share, using opacity as a cover.
411253407878377472 2013-12-12 21:57:07 +0000 <naval> Angels should start asking for pro-rata rights - they're extremely valuable. Don't count on entrepreneur to deliver when the squeeze is on.
411253159181312000 2013-12-12 21:56:08 +0000 <naval> I'd like to create and track a list of VCs who commit to letting angels participate pro-rata. I'd like to refer deals to them.
411252799305830400 2013-12-12 21:54:42 +0000 <naval> Amazing how some entrepreneurs squeeze out angels (pro-rata) to appease insatiable VC appetite in later rounds. Short term mentality.
411051501520306176 2013-12-12 08:34:49 +0000 <naval> @JiffyLu Sorry, I meant by being more "integrated."
410996853413400576 2013-12-12 04:57:40 +0000 <naval> @mattlangan no, by services.
410996750761996288 2013-12-12 04:57:15 +0000 <naval> @WillPao The market of entrepreneurs will decide, but it's certainly counter-intuitive.
410995638130585600 2013-12-12 04:52:50 +0000 <naval> Venture Capital is that rare industry that's reacting to increased competition by verticalizing rather than specializing.
410992681439883264 2013-12-12 04:41:05 +0000 <naval> @yixiza understood, but I assume this is for cofounding, create a stub company profile.
410990892892168193 2013-12-12 04:33:59 +0000 <naval> @dsb David, please check again. We have a different back-end and closing process now. Email me at naval@ if you don't see it.

410695528104488960 2013-12-11 09:00:18 +0000 <naval> @alokmittal001 @shervin How do you insure cash? Not possible.

409483488027369472 2013-12-08 00:44:06 +0000 <naval> @Jason I really wouldn't count on it. Could happen, could not. If you want it, just average in.

406525998880944128 2013-11-29 20:52:05 +0000 <naval> @semil we need to stop telling people that it's ok to get a state-subsidized PhD in over-supplied, non-scientific disciplines.
406525745138135040 2013-11-29 20:51:05 +0000 <naval> @semil Every tech generation has these issues - industrial revolution, agrarian revolution were no different.
406525609943121920 2013-11-29 20:50:32 +0000 <naval> @semil I wish more adults would try hackreactor, codeacademy etc. not to switch careers, but to become technically literate.
406523726620925952 2013-11-29 20:43:03 +0000 <naval> @semil It assumes static specializations in the labor market. We are not all farmers anymore.
406523574338330625 2013-11-29 20:42:27 +0000 <naval> @semil The counterpoint to these arguments is that everyone will be tech-enabled. Like how everyone tries to be white collar now.
406143868371869696 2013-11-28 19:33:38 +0000 <naval> @jeff Doesn't matter as you shouldn't leave any of your BTC in the cloud, move it offline and local.
406142168621789184 2013-11-28 19:26:53 +0000 <naval> @jeff no, but why not just use Bitstamp?
405950988218929152 2013-11-28 06:47:12 +0000 <naval> @DaPerzer @angellist Which one?
405851009143959552 2013-11-28 00:09:55 +0000 <naval> @Reuven Impossible. Suggest you research how commodity markets work.
405815290912464896 2013-11-27 21:47:59 +0000 <naval> @ryaneshea @Jason If you believe that, you should buy litecoin as the market spread is much greater right now.
405814908240928768 2013-11-27 21:46:28 +0000 <naval> @Reuven That entity would have to spend $1-$10 Trillion to buy enough supply first. Not possible.
405804601506422784 2013-11-27 21:05:31 +0000 <naval> @oleganza @dhh Only way BTC fails long term is if there are extreme gov't backed attempts to halt it. Still quite likely, actually.
405804311143133184 2013-11-27 21:04:21 +0000 <naval> @dhh @oleganza if it lasts as a bubble for years, the implied stability alone will make it a store of value, like gold.
405803301641281537 2013-11-27 21:00:21 +0000 <naval> @ryaneshea @Jason "Fair" is sadly a relative concept. Nothing wins in the market because it's "fair" (according to whom?).
405798235211436032 2013-11-27 20:40:13 +0000 <naval> @gojomo @johnolilly @cdixon You still need a single asset in which to denominate prices. That asset is money.
405751379383156736 2013-11-27 17:34:02 +0000 <naval> @rodolfor @ashfontana We did. You can leave a comment and share it. But if you're helping them, they should make you an advisor :-)

385246334506106880 2013-10-02 03:34:18 +0000 <naval> @wadhwa thanks. We take real security holes seriously and fix them. This is not one.
385245919265845250 2013-10-02 03:32:39 +0000 <naval> @wadhwa a scam would be if he actually gets money. He won't be able to do that. If he finds a real security hole, we will fix it.

385245393421758464 2013-10-02 03:30:33 +0000 <naval> @wadhwa we can't block account creation.
385245282188791808 2013-10-02 03:30:07 +0000 <naval> @wadhwa it's an open platform like twitter or Facebook. We caught and removed it. No money ever did or could have changed hands.
385245080132411392 2013-10-02 03:29:19 +0000 <naval> @wadhwa same as people who create fake accounts on Facebook. Unstoppable, silly, and pointless.
385244832542633984 2013-10-02 03:28:20 +0000 <naval> @wadhwa the most harm he could possibly do is invest his own money. All he did was promise himself money. No real harm is possible here.
385244632277213184 2013-10-02 03:27:32 +0000 <naval> @wadhwa What hole, Vivek? Everyone uses self-accreditation for first pass. Everyone. If he tried to invest, then additional controls kick in
385243504630173696 2013-10-02 03:23:03 +0000 <naval> @wadhwa you can't invest online without going through SecondMarket screen. He just created an account.
385243198169153536 2013-10-02 03:21:50 +0000 <naval> @wadhwa wasn't a scam, Vivek. There are multiple layers of accreditation. Zero harm was done. He's being sensationalist.
385242103007039489 2013-10-02 03:17:29 +0000 <naval> @pointsnfigures @JFIELDS49 It's not easy, try investing some money and you'll be asked for accreditation proof.

382300694318825473 2013-09-24 00:29:22 +0000 <naval> @DonDodge fair enough. We expect that backing will come from LPs eventually, not angels. And leads commit to spending time and helping Co.

381237756027863040 2013-09-21 02:05:38 +0000 <naval> @ProfessorVC @hunterwalk Syndicate lead does commit their portion (~10%) no matter what. But unlikely they can backstop $250K - $750K

381120315356491777 2013-09-20 18:18:58 +0000 <naval> @danprimack good points. Another tack - demo days can also restrict to Accredited Investors and NDA-ed individuals only.
381119341090963456 2013-09-20 18:15:06 +0000 <naval> @utekkare @semil Hopefully not too many. There are a lot less soft landings than media coverage would imply.

361320454658600962 2013-07-28 03:01:24 +0000 <naval> @mattlangan Not really. Underlying reasons for backing are the same.
361311542114910208 2013-07-28 02:25:59 +0000 <naval> @mattlangan Not unless you also consider VC funds to be an affiliate program...
361281476605657088 2013-07-28 00:26:30 +0000 <naval> @rjonesy @chrismaddern @jordancooper Other way around, best companies who have enough value add. 20% based on VC. Anyhow, wait n see.
361281094315810816 2013-07-28 00:24:59 +0000 <naval> @CynthiaSchames Sure
361280084029616130 2013-07-28 00:20:58 +0000 <naval> @CynthiaSchames Carry is set by the angel. Company determines who if anyone has an allocation. SEC gave us no-action letter, it is regulated
361279753916907520 2013-07-28 00:19:40 +0000 <naval> @TarikaMarshall @ifindkarma @StartupLJackson yes, in a bit.

361264901362163713 2013-07-27 23:20:39 +0000 <naval> @ProfessorVC @paulsingh @angellist I.e., if I commit $25K to lead a $250K syndicate, I have to put in 25. Syndicate can be time delimited.

361198368736813056 2013-07-27 18:56:16 +0000 <naval> @jordancooper @nchirls @hunterwalk If it helps, backers are LPs &amp; passive micro angels. Not expecting actives like seed funds to pay carry.
361185929731383297 2013-07-27 18:06:50 +0000 <naval> @jordancooper @nchirls @hunterwalk Up to company and investor. They can set carry to whatever they want, incl 0. We'll see, it's in beta :-)
361183306030649345 2013-07-27 17:56:25 +0000 <naval> @jordancooper @nchirls @hunterwalk Also works for pro-ratas, small funds, and for companies wanting smaller cap table.

361182397632487424 2013-07-27 17:52:48 +0000 <naval> @jordancooper @nchirls @hunterwalk Works best for top-tier, high-value angels who don't have a fund and don't wish to manage one.
361182274705833989 2013-07-27 17:52:19 +0000 <naval> @jordancooper @nchirls @hunterwalk Same as companies giving allocation to VCs for access to LP Money, Network, Value Add.

325060980449112064 2013-04-19 01:39:11 +0000 <naval> @EghosaO @teddiew That's a proxy for the DCF on the profit stream. Eventually a valuation = discounted sum of profits. No other way.

325056299077353472 2013-04-19 01:20:35 +0000 <naval> @brettsimonson If that gateway works, the price of BTC will skyrocket. Currency value of BTC comes well after all hoarding value realized.
325054439419412482 2013-04-19 01:13:12 +0000 <naval> @teddiew Relative to buying the BTC. Your point is correct if BTC can win while staying at its current market cap. But that's impossible.
325054324763934720 2013-04-19 01:12:44 +0000 <naval> @teddiew But over time they would have to extract at least 2.5% of the BTC in *profit* from those transactions to be worthwhile investments

267428123249881088 2012-11-11 00:46:47 +0000 <naval> @galenward My hunch - a few tax increases and cuts but no meaningful reform. Slow-mo Greek outcome but inflation instead of deflation
267427415326879746 2012-11-11 00:43:59 +0000 <naval> @ben_mathes @kmontag AngelList Tahoe? Show of hands...
267427171813957633 2012-11-11 00:43:00 +0000 <naval> @galenward Agreed. The true burden of government is not what it taxes but what it spends. Spending is the problem.
267426941362139136 2012-11-11 00:42:06 +0000 <naval> @galenward fighting is because it is punitive to a single constituency and doesn't close the gap meaningfully. It's obviously political.
267426631847641088 2012-11-11 00:40:52 +0000 <naval> @galenward Clinton-era would be fine if and only if budget balanced. Painful for those of us in bankrupt and California though.
267425874771578880 2012-11-11 00:37:51 +0000 <naval> @galenward Not meaningless to those taxed.
267425751496810496 2012-11-11 00:37:22 +0000 <naval> @galenward Funny, i didnt read it that way but our politics color our perceptions.
267425611079880704 2012-11-11 00:36:48 +0000 <naval> @galenward If this was a startup, we'd jusr cut everything across the board, 20%, no exceptions, and get back to work :-)
267422038493364225 2012-11-11 00:22:37 +0000 <naval> @galenward the deficit is a by-product of out of control spending. North Korea has a balanced budget...

267419977999593472 2012-11-11 00:14:25 +0000 <naval> @jim_shook the point is that raising taxes only on 250K+ doesnt do much. i think we all get basic game theory.

267112563408502784 2012-11-10 03:52:52 +0000 <naval> @johnolilly Solution is to put him in a position that isn't security sensitive - I.e., some senior civil position.

261734618359808000 2012-10-26 07:42:50 +0000 <naval> @asaxena unions are cartels, few new workers, not much turnover. Anyway, not going to change anyone's politics in 140. G'night :-)
261733203453288448 2012-10-26 07:37:13 +0000 <naval> @asaxena beyond getting a wage. Cal unions have hijacked and are bankrupting the state, public salaries &gt; private. Self-reinforcing loop.

261727256827809792 2012-10-26 07:13:35 +0000 <naval> @asaxena @mm big difference between some interest and 100%. Witness expansion of unions that use tax dollars to lobby for higher taxes.
261722966600065024 2012-10-26 06:56:32 +0000 <naval> @mm private workers don't obtain and negotiate 100% of their income via the gov't, corporate welfare notwithstanding.

256808362988150784 2012-10-12 17:27:39 +0000 <naval> @naval @SuthaKamal the market wins. My point was about people trying to outguess intrade in politics and the bond market on inflation, etc.
256808192766517250 2012-10-12 17:26:59 +0000 <naval> @naval @SuthaKamal But if you bet against the market on a regular basis, you will lose. Of course some people win occasionally, but overall
256808070963929088 2012-10-12 17:26:30 +0000 <naval> @naval @SuthaKamal There's no currency there so there's no market. Individuals can and do beta against markets and occasionally win
256807968308350976 2012-10-12 17:26:05 +0000 <naval> @SuthaKamal In conventional wisdom, one can't bet against the market, make tons of "wisdom" and use that to corner and reprice the market.
256807749365669889 2012-10-12 17:25:13 +0000 <naval> @michaelbyrne Agreed. Impossible to have a reasoned conversation in 140 chars
256802096265969664 2012-10-12 17:02:45 +0000 <naval> @michaelbyrne there is no true market for consensus. In a true market one actor can bet against everyone else and win.
256801704291483648 2012-10-12 17:01:12 +0000 <naval> @SuthaKamal you're just digging yourself in deeper :-)
256770940480925696 2012-10-12 14:58:57 +0000 <naval> @herval On average, gamblers lose, but they can win 49% of hands. Anyway, Soros bet against an irrational single player known as the UK gov.
256770604546531328 2012-10-12 14:57:37 +0000 <naval> @SuthaKamal no, markets have price discovery and a consequence for being wrong, a reward for bring right. They are not a pile of opinions.
256769151530577920 2012-10-12 14:51:50 +0000 <naval> @herval I'm referring to actual markets, not groupthink. Huge difference.

238665094429548545 2012-08-23 15:52:47 +0000 <naval> @dh yup, but it's designed for silicon-valley-esque companies. If we allow 0, everyone puts that and transparency fails.
238664761380843520 2012-08-23 15:51:27 +0000 <naval> @dh understood, no harm. We had to make some hard choices to have a point of view and a differentiated offering.

238660884786978816 2012-08-23 15:36:03 +0000 <naval> @rjonesy @semil Why not? Requires an affluent city with reasonable urban density. Anyplace you see deliveries happening, should work.
238660558910541824 2012-08-23 15:34:46 +0000 <naval> @dh @dvampan in this market? No one good is going to be an employee at a startup for 0 stock or salary (latter is a co founder position)

222928169299230721 2012-07-11 05:39:52 +0000 <naval> @manasgarg The one on the left.
222912380353511424 2012-07-11 04:37:07 +0000 <naval> If you can't decide, the answer is No.
222912289651703810 2012-07-11 04:36:46 +0000 <naval> @rfradin @levie Agreed. He's entitled to do whatever he wants. Running Microsoft must have been insanely all-consuming.

222910034147950593 2012-07-11 04:27:48 +0000 <naval> @levie honestly, I think Gates would have done more good by making MSFT more valuable and having more money to give away.
222901790138564612 2012-07-11 03:55:02 +0000 <naval> @rkhanna @angellist Cheaper for us if you learn to type :-)

222580203023634432 2012-07-10 06:37:10 +0000 <naval> @jackdempsey context would ruin it :-) But I would say that if you are going to do something great, don't expect validation too.

221148500744867841 2012-07-06 07:48:05 +0000 <naval> @ScottFerreira the URL is Punycode, a way to convert graphical URLs to regular domains.

221146756216393728 2012-07-06 07:41:10 +0000 <naval> @jasoncrawford Surprised people still care about the NYT list. I'd rather check App store or Amazon rankings.

220765099764350977 2012-07-05 06:24:36 +0000 <naval> @mik3cap alright, given your physics schooling, I'd say college paid off for you!
220764376876072960 2012-07-05 06:21:43 +0000 <naval> @lylemckeany that's beyond my meager abilities...

220758618511917057 2012-07-05 05:58:50 +0000 <naval> @shashank_ps But how does it impart mass?
220758494775754754 2012-07-05 05:58:21 +0000 <naval> @lylemckeany But how?
220758460491501570 2012-07-05 05:58:13 +0000 <naval> @markb Right, how does it give things mass?
220757423370158082 2012-07-05 05:54:05 +0000 <naval> @mik3cap Yeah, I paid for it and it wasn't worth it. Connections long gone.
220754947808043009 2012-07-05 05:44:15 +0000 <naval> @Cody_Jon Not worth $200K
220754898910855169 2012-07-05 05:44:03 +0000 <naval> @rohit_x_ It's aspirational, not real
220754821303648256 2012-07-05 05:43:45 +0000 <naval> @mik3cap It's called real life.
220754754001829889 2012-07-05 05:43:29 +0000 <naval> @adrianbye An honest tweeter :-)
220754695646490624 2012-07-05 05:43:15 +0000 <naval> @mik3cap Not worth $250K / 4 years. Other ways to get that.
220754613522006016 2012-07-05 05:42:55 +0000 <naval> @GordonBrianR Research should be paid on its own, not need a huge education apparatus to support it.

220753878654779395 2012-07-05 05:40:00 +0000 <naval> @holdonjohn @hnshah Agreed. Needs a test and certification component though.
220753698429743104 2012-07-05 05:39:17 +0000 <naval> @endashes @MattRogish College is the bottom line - they raise prices like crazy, no alternative. They have a brand-based network effect.
220753511992930304 2012-07-05 05:38:33 +0000 <naval> @_AlexLawrence @windley It's $200K now for a private school.
220753331302309888 2012-07-05 05:37:50 +0000 <naval> @tinoubao $200K and 4 years can get you a lot pf parties.
220753231620476928 2012-07-05 05:37:26 +0000 <naval> @PorterHaney @Pv It's possible to grow up without paying $200K
220753063584083968 2012-07-05 05:36:46 +0000 <naval> @JeremyRudy that's what I'm proposing. A certification / signal

220717099587338241 2012-07-05 03:13:51 +0000 <naval> To everyone saying that college is about connections and soft stuff - sure, but there are ways to do that without $200K and 4 years.
220713195323658240 2012-07-05 02:58:21 +0000 <naval> Imagine an online school where top scientists lecture a million kids at zero marginal cost. Add rigorous testing, diplomas. Goodbye college.

220632250662920193 2012-07-04 21:36:42 +0000 <naval> @mm Funny. Someone once snarked that a conversation is just a device to find out how much someone is paying for their apartment.
220548765218648064 2012-07-04 16:04:57 +0000 <naval> @JeffMiller @angellist Ha, funny :-)
220383618265133056 2012-07-04 05:08:43 +0000 <naval> @Pv Agreed
220356554837327872 2012-07-04 03:21:11 +0000 <naval> @smit1293 yup. So many people seem to pretend that it's planned or try to plan it.
220356395655114752 2012-07-04 03:20:33 +0000 <naval> @AntiFreeze good answer :-)
220354538480214016 2012-07-04 03:13:10 +0000 <naval> I wonder if a startup culture is planned, or rather an emergent property of the core team.
219951196587298817 2012-07-03 00:30:26 +0000 <naval> @comptly maybe on shopping site ask why you want to buy a product. Then, many screens later, offer them that attribute
219951053192441856 2012-07-03 00:29:52 +0000 <naval> @comptly good one. If you figure it out, please let me know.
219950461833318400 2012-07-03 00:27:31 +0000 <naval> M&amp;A groups in big companies should be compensated and run like VC firms. Otherwise all you've done is scale up the principal agent problem.

206882413446561792 2012-05-27 22:59:45 +0000 <naval> @nikiscevak @sacca Yes, advisors should take responsibility until the end.
206882202741510146 2012-05-27 22:58:55 +0000 <naval> @brianmwang Kind of you. We'll productize it all into AngelList. Or post any questions there.

206870922504843266 2012-05-27 22:14:06 +0000 <naval> @vinaeco @angellist Yes, on hold.
206870761066070017 2012-05-27 22:13:27 +0000 <naval> If you must do Business Development, do it via APIs.
206864439650172931 2012-05-27 21:48:20 +0000 <naval> @KieranO I will :-)
206864122388815873 2012-05-27 21:47:04 +0000 <naval> @Jason @sacca Exactly, market is broken. Economics of a top incubator are equivalent to a $B venture fund, without the capital requirements.
206863309306200065 2012-05-27 21:43:50 +0000 <naval> @sacca Exactly - they run an auction for the next round. It will lead to a glut of incubators and a shortage of angels.
206862316074041345 2012-05-27 21:39:54 +0000 <naval> @sacca Incubators have taken over the advisory component of the market. Try pay 1/30th the angel price for a mere 10-week commitment.
206861781723922432 2012-05-27 21:37:46 +0000 <naval> @maclackey drives it up since they're buying options and don't care about current price.
206861586005110784 2012-05-27 21:37:00 +0000 <naval> @sacca Agreed. Some of the party round valuations are out of control. I don't think you can make money in seed beyond an avg price of ~$5M
206861335420604416 2012-05-27 21:36:00 +0000 <naval> Startup financings have variable terms and fixed prices. The future is standardized terms and variable prices ( like public markets).
206861085708525568 2012-05-27 21:35:00 +0000 <naval> @rakeshlobster @semil You had the opportunity on the secondary markets and will again.
206860883312390144 2012-05-27 21:34:12 +0000 <naval> @sacca Right, so it's a time and quality axis. Problem with advice and money being bundled. They should pay you separately for each.
206860480210407425 2012-05-27 21:32:36 +0000 <naval> @lucasdickey good feedback, we will curate startups too.
206860395498045441 2012-05-27 21:32:16 +0000 <naval> @maclackey Not standard pricing - rather standard terms and variable pricing.
206860213830164480 2012-05-27 21:31:32 +0000 <naval> @rakeshlobster @semil Those days are gone. Now MSFT would have returns stripped by SecondMarket before going public. Go early or don't play.
206859881209282560 2012-05-27 21:30:13 +0000 <naval> @sacca Long term it's ok. That's how real markets operate. A market without price discovery has no way to transmit information.
206859686237057024 2012-05-27 21:29:27 +0000 <naval> @sacca I've gotten conflicting advice on carrying value and tax implications. Trying to figure it out and automate it.
206859465331449856 2012-05-27 21:28:34 +0000 <naval> @sacca Yes, some pricing must exist, but based on first commitment and value add, not just on a few weeks of time. It'll slowly rationalize.
206859166730567682 2012-05-27 21:27:23 +0000 <naval> @rakeshlobster @semil Untrue. Check actual closing prices, not estimates from Sharespost, which seems to make up estimates.
206859007065985024 2012-05-27 21:26:45 +0000 <naval> @rakeshlobster @semil The point is that if you waited for it to go public, you missed out. So if you want returns, go earlier.
206858881660493824 2012-05-27 21:26:15 +0000 <naval> @rakeshlobster @semil Not true, almost all of actual closed SM trades were south of the current price and that's Before FB missed numbers.
206858299658870784 2012-05-27 21:23:56 +0000 <naval> @rakeshlobster @semil No, average closing price on secondmarket the month before was 32-34. And then FB gave downward guidance.
206857985018966016 2012-05-27 21:22:41 +0000 <naval> @graemehein @semil You inspired my latest tweet...
206857898922475522 2012-05-27 21:22:20 +0000 <naval> Startup financings exhibit herd mentality because there's no pricing. If first movers paid *a lot* less, financings would be rational.
206857383882919936 2012-05-27 21:20:18 +0000 <naval> @jfarmer sorry, had too much to drink.
206848657046253568 2012-05-27 20:45:37 +0000 <naval> @9rd hard in a tweet :-) Outcomes are extreme so financings are extreme.
206846631717515265 2012-05-27 20:37:34 +0000 <naval> Startup outcomes fall on a power law distribution. So startup financings look the same way. You're unfundable until you're oversubscribed.
206846277273661440 2012-05-27 20:36:10 +0000 <naval> @brendanbaker yup
206843082694598656 2012-05-27 20:23:28 +0000 <naval> @iHearGeoff depends on type of app, but hundreds of thousands of users with strong growth.
206842929782849536 2012-05-27 20:22:52 +0000 <naval> The real story of the FB IPO is that secondary markets priced it efficiently. So look for more Wall Street money to go earlier stage.
206842530577395713 2012-05-27 20:21:16 +0000 <naval> @aweissman yes, power law distribution of outcomes. So financings themselves have power law dynamics - you're oversubscribed or unfundable.
206840873193979904 2012-05-27 20:14:41 +0000 <naval> @aweissman it does mean that less of these companies need or should be funded - but those that are produce spectacular returns (instagram)

198989801423245312 2012-05-06 04:17:20 +0000 <naval> Efficient markets are more volatile, not less. New information gets priced in instantly. Internet investment is becoming more efficient...

193216643520921600 2012-04-20 05:56:52 +0000 <naval> @farbood Yes, in a sense, fossils are just batteries with pre-stored solar. Similarly, uranium energy reserves &gt;&gt; fossil fuels.
193170665862463488 2012-04-20 02:54:10 +0000 <naval> @farbood Cute, but thermodynamically impractical. Civilization progresses by locally reversing entropy. Diffuse power sources are step back.

192876990469111808 2012-04-19 07:27:12 +0000 <naval> Dear investors: price matters. Low prices let you make more bets. In some sense, Pinterest, Instagram, Turntable, & OMGPOP were all pivots.

192425336053563392 2012-04-18 01:32:29 +0000 <naval> @erickschonfeld Good point. Maybe a non-profit, with a constitutional "no first use" policy? But yeah, NATO attacks countries too...

189401599981006851 2012-04-09 17:17:15 +0000 <naval> Scaling product reduces external coordination costs. Scaling team increases internal coordination costs. Ratio of the two is leverage.

188837193874292736 2012-04-08 03:54:30 +0000 <naval> @lucasdickey no, competition and failure is necessary for success. Sign of vibrancy, not redundancy.

183708385202548736 2012-03-25 00:14:26 +0000 <naval> @erickschonfeld Depends on final SEC rulings and structure. It's still quite fuzzy. There's a 9 month rulemaking period.
183675700371390464 2012-03-24 22:04:34 +0000 <naval> A week ago, the #JOBSAct was in trouble. Yesterday, it was passed 73-26 by the Senate! Our 5000 sigs made a difference  http://t.co/lTFysKRN

183383598576054273 2012-03-24 02:43:51 +0000 <naval> I don't understand how @spotify can be worth $3.5B. Labels will squeeze margins just as Studios did to @netflix.
183383028620464128 2012-03-24 02:41:35 +0000 <naval> @SamHenry3G Unusable for me.
183380541003935745 2012-03-24 02:31:42 +0000 <naval> @semil No - LinkedIn is cross-enterprise and most activity in enterprises is within the enterprise.
183367523117441025 2012-03-24 01:39:58 +0000 <naval> .@Facebook is the backbone for consumer apps, @twitter for media apps. I suspect that @yammer will be the backbone for enterprise apps

182146428800466944 2012-03-20 16:47:47 +0000 <naval> @DanielZarick yes, Verizon version. AT&amp;T slower, less coverage, no hotspot feature.
182144755969429504 2012-03-20 16:41:08 +0000 <naval> @DanielZarick I think so - faster than my home broadband and included hotspot (Verizon)

181198592483135488 2012-03-18 02:01:25 +0000 <naval> @Bill_Gross Cause or effect?
181197619257815040 2012-03-18 01:57:33 +0000 <naval> @samrogoway and to be clear, we could charge today if we wanted to. But we don't.  The Act doesn't change that, just enables new things.
181196727758491649 2012-03-18 01:54:01 +0000 <naval> @samrogoway there is, but there's something in there for everyone. It's all potential.

181105020635320320 2012-03-17 19:49:36 +0000 <naval> @AaronKlein @cdixon There's a ton in there. Better to pass and amend than to let it die. It's basically crowdfunding, Reg D, 500 Shareholder

165503563093639168 2012-02-03 18:34:59 +0000 <naval> @GavWeeks we review those profiles. If startups could share themselves to investors there would be enormous spam.
165468859187470337 2012-02-03 16:17:04 +0000 <naval> @GavWeeks you can share with the followers of the people connected to the startup. We curate and distribute the top ones as well.

165142628357246976 2012-02-02 18:40:45 +0000 <naval> @dlifson At least two companies I know right now closing VC lead rounds where they found lead via AL.

158089582938820609 2012-01-14 07:34:28 +0000 <naval> @brunobowden I agree but still prefer iOS for most other functions. Android will likely win eventually but ways to go.

140881794210861056 2011-11-27 19:56:51 +0000 <naval> @cdixon Or surviving Euro might be core countries only. Euro in a Greek bank deposit is in less demand than a Euro in a German bank.
140863526762856448 2011-11-27 18:44:16 +0000 <naval> @georgezachary @joshk Totally agreed. Senior Bondholders of banks should take a haircut and recap the banks. Bailouts are un-necessary.

124525667248386050 2011-10-13 16:43:27 +0000 <naval> @iPaulLee That WSJ piece wasn't based on AL data. AL intros are sharply up and we don't know valuations / closings.
124509086149652481 2011-10-13 15:37:34 +0000 <naval> @jeffreymcmanus @gaberivera WSJ not based on AL data. Intro counts way up but we don't know transactions. Personal sns that vals flattening.

124505622728290304 2011-10-13 15:23:48 +0000 <naval> @danprimack and it's not a cash crunch as much as valuations flattening / normalizing. Real crunch is at VC level.
124503869869924353 2011-10-13 15:16:50 +0000 <naval> @danprimack thx but WSJ clmn not based on AL data. Our intro counts are way up. My personal sense is vals coming down. Nobody really knows.

124329406742269952 2011-10-13 03:43:35 +0000 <naval> @davemcclure @msuster Agreed if valuations reflect it. YC / 500S might do fine with higher failure rates, but angels / VCs may not.

47891158755581952 2011-03-16 05:25:16 +0000 <naval> @ScotterC True, really mostly just means the plant and surrounding area will become a nature haven :-)
47891021245321217 2011-03-16 05:24:43 +0000 <naval> @CoolHandNuke right. All about the containment.
47890870665613312 2011-03-16 05:24:07 +0000 <naval> @schnaars That's what they eventually did to Chernobyl. Maybe why Japanese gov't is asking US military for help - Chinook airlift, etc.
47890367126843392 2011-03-16 05:22:07 +0000 <naval> @ScotterC that's not clear. The Japanese gov't spokesman acknowledged that there may have been a partial containment breach in two reactors.
47885864424050688 2011-03-16 05:04:14 +0000 <naval> Hmmm. Hard to see from here how they prevent a #Fukushima meltdown. Probably makes sense to bury the site with sand from the air.

30310971629109248 2011-01-26 17:07:53 +0000 <naval> @andreehuk Thank you for the invitation but I won't be able to get there in March.
30197121751715840 2011-01-26 09:35:29 +0000 <naval> @maithreyi Honestly that's all I know - the rest is just whatever comes up, spontaneously.

30155757601161216 2011-01-26 06:51:07 +0000 <naval> I am speaking at @AlchemistSeries panel on How to Fundraise this Wed at 7pm in SoMa. Come and join me. More info: www.alchemistseries.com
30098289487519744 2011-01-26 03:02:46 +0000 <naval> @pkedrosky Incredible. Their revenue is basically a dependent variable on Google's ranking algorithm.
29940837844520960 2011-01-25 16:37:06 +0000 <naval> @Destiny_Forbes you get an email introducing you if an investor views your startup profile and likes it enough to request one.
29940558210277376 2011-01-25 16:36:00 +0000 <naval> @jamiequint Good point. Yelp is another good example.

29645957452791808 2011-01-24 21:05:21 +0000 <naval> @BioEntrepreneur @lifescivc Easy to mock, but the record of central planning speaks for itself. Thanks for the ad-hominem attacks (not).
29618894654148608 2011-01-24 19:17:49 +0000 <naval> @amit_j28 Not necessarily. Quality on Twitter doesn't go down as they add users because I only follow the people who are high quality to me.
29616227424931840 2011-01-24 19:07:13 +0000 <naval> People saying Quora won't scale don't understand how having a social graph changes incentives and dramatically improves filtering
29615864605048832 2011-01-24 19:05:47 +0000 <naval> @BioEntrepreneur @lifescivc they fake and fudge. Tax increases are buried. Taxes for 10 yrs, benefits for 5. All kinds of games.
29588464387235840 2011-01-24 17:16:54 +0000 <naval> @freddealmeida @angellist at a high level, yes. I.e., "Series Seed, $3M pre-money, $200K committed."
29588047611822080 2011-01-24 17:15:14 +0000 <naval> @BioEntrepreneur @lifescivc his point is that raising taxes is not really a free deficit cutting technique. Seems straightforward.

29000730299858944 2011-01-23 02:21:27 +0000 <naval> @JerLevine totally agreed. Networking and the agenda-less coffees are pointless.
28991167966224385 2011-01-23 01:43:27 +0000 <naval> @joshu @clubdinein I got "EverGreen - Pantone 19-5420" Nice to know that the ancient art of colorostrology follows Pantone classification.
28990619082821632 2011-01-23 01:41:16 +0000 <naval> @joshu It really got me, at a core level. These people looked deep into my soul & assigned me a color based on the day that I was born.
28990170514587649 2011-01-23 01:39:29 +0000 <naval> @clubdinein Dark Green. It was spooky how accurate it was! Of course, every other day's coloroscope seemed accurate too ;-)

28549229978845184 2011-01-21 20:27:21 +0000 <naval> @thinkscrappy They've lowered the amounts and only apply them to new customers now. So they're more voluminous but less applicable.
28406008837574656 2011-01-21 10:58:14 +0000 <naval> E-tailer coupons shrank in size and applicability once market was saturated & buyer loyalty collapsed. Will same happen to local services?
28405026791628800 2011-01-21 10:54:20 +0000 <naval> Amazon knows where I live, what I buy, and my Credit Card Number. Perfect distribution for a GroupOn-like offering.
28398257814114304 2011-01-21 10:27:26 +0000 <naval> Coupons are just an ad format that users seek out. Every ad in your snail mail box is a coupon. Why aren't all Adwords coupons?
28397770096250881 2011-01-21 10:25:30 +0000 <naval> Larry's Google should fund 200 Local Deal innovators, round-robin traffic to them, and pocket the remaining $5.9 Billion. #AngelFantasies
28392815801143296 2011-01-21 10:05:49 +0000 <naval> .@ai More important is the reverse point. If you are working at a startup pre-funding, salary & product, you should probably be a founder.
28392460052865024 2011-01-21 10:04:24 +0000 <naval> @smysore absolutely - hope it was useful.
