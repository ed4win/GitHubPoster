  2021 was a crazy year for info products.  Thank you to the 3,771 customers who invested their time &amp; money into one of my products.  I appreciate you.  This channel grew 500% this year, and I'm pumped to see what happens in 2022.  If you're selling online, keep going! üöÄ  https://t.co/7W4qPdXjGv
  @btmitchell25 @Josh-G-Roth @BrianBrackeen We‚Äôre coming to check it out and a move isn‚Äôt out of the question. Appreciate it!
  @shireenjaffer- @brendanjshort @Raaid27 Amazing. Thank you! Much appreciated.
  @BGroat Guilty.
  @mistamor Sweet. Are those places pretty accessible to the rest of the city?  Down for a beer for sure.
  Miami folks: I want to come visit in Q1.  And I know very little about the city...  What are the best neighborhoods to stay for a couple of 40-something foodies who also like cocktails?
  @SachinRamje Great thread, Sachin. I appreciate you including me and for the extremely kind words.   2022 gonna be big for you. üî•
  Don't complain about a product.  Build a better one and sell it.
  @katairobi Nice, Robert! I hope you love it. üî•
  @NickB2005 Have a lawyer create your own Ts and Cs. Then, don't budge. That's my motto.
  @Aniketmlive @owenvideo @Daniel-Batal @ColinandSamir Appreciate that, Aniket. Cheers to a big 2022.
  Happy Friday to entrepreneurs working to impress themselves, not others.
  @jackbutcher gm. Have a great NYE, Jack. Hope all is well.
  @CFOAdam That's awesome to hear. Thanks!
  @quillynl Works for anyone, but I mostly talk to solopreneurs.
  Solopreneur marketing strategy:  Figure things out in public.
  Happy Thursday to entrepreneurs unashamedly building a lifestyle business.
  @tanyamoushi Thank you, Tanya!
  This is a play you can run over and over.  By doing so, you start to systematize solutions to the same challenge.  Work becomes easier and more efficient.  "Oh, I've seen this before - I know what to do."  Run this play in 2022.
  3 reasons I like this strategy:  1. It allows me to work on challenges I enjoy.  2. It makes the engagement low-risk because payment is based on business improvement.  3. It helps me form strong relationships and create a referral network early.  That network compounds.
  If I had to start my entrepreneur journey over again, here's what I'd do:  - Choose a skill I know cold - Find 2-3 companies struggling - Setup "improvement-based" pay - Track all meaningful improvement - Ask for testimonials for my website - Get intros to other similar companies
  @Creator-Coach Yes, it was hard. No, it didn't come easy.  Today? Easy as can be.  It's just a muscle you build. Start small.
  @Creator-Coach Share your knowledge freely with no expectation.
  @thegoldsuite Yep, basically what I wrote in this thread. We're aligned.   https://t.co/t5QW8A88N1
  @rufaimunye @jackbutcher @visualizevalue I don't know that there's a right way.  Jack has a distinct personal brand and a very unique visual process.  IMO, start by becoming known for something, and worry less about the details of one vs. two.
  @AdrienneNakohl I think it helps to be intentional.   Doesn't mean you'll get to where you thought you were going though.  Keep it simple and flexible.
  Build a brand where people want to follow you and companies want to hire you.  Incredible leverage.
  @Kjellvdv I don't help people invest, rather I support people by investing in them.  I've written 4 angel checks to friends I believe in.
  @Kjellvdv Courses, coaching, community, advising, AMAs, investing.
  Solopreneurship 101:  - Learn a skill at work - Consult with that skill for a reasonable rate - Learn about your customer's most pressing needs - Niche down to solving only that and raise your rates - Productize everything else you learned and sell it online

  Happy Wednesday to entrepreneurs diversifying their income.
  @Tim-Denning @creation247 I own his course and somehow wasn‚Äôt following him. Thanks for the nudge, Tim!
  @iamcesarromero @Viernest @Yannick-Veys It‚Äôs less the downside of Buffer and more the upside of HypeFury.   Trial both of them. You‚Äôll see.
  @jmcmillen89 Start by embracing slight discomfort.  It's amazing how much easier it gets over time...
  @jspector Newsletters are like books.  Most could do without the filler.
  @OmarMKhateeb Feels like the other 10% is taking what you learned from the small risks and making adjustments.  Entrepreneurship (at least so far) feels like risk, adjustments, risk, adjustment, risk, adjustment, etc.
  @reneefishman I'm simply talking about businesses without any employees.   My wife is a huge part of our success for sure.
  @Kjellvdv Supporting people and helping them succeed.
  @AdrienneNakohl Ignore my use of autonomous when I meant auto-didactic.
  @cwtorek Yep. The other 10% is just paying attention to what happens and making better decisions.
  @AdrienneNakohl Most of education is spent learning to conform. Maybe that‚Äôs why?
  @luke-netti Glad I‚Äôm not the only one üôåüèª
  @wadboy- Yep. Each one feels a bit easier.
  It feels like 90% of being an entrepreneur is taking small but uncomfortable risks.
  @Viernest They just released direct posting to LinkedIn, which makes it extremely valuable.   To me, it‚Äôs the best tool on the market. I just left Buffer for it.   @Yannick-Veys - anything to add here?
  @mattragland Therapy is a game changer.   If it‚Äôs in your budget, everyone, regardless of how they feel should go.   Been going for over a year and it helps me understand (and overcome) my fears.
  @StevenTrister Keep running this process, and you‚Äôll continue to increase your prices. Get after it.
  @BahWad Appreciate it!
  @ArrigoLupori People often niche down and then forget to update their messaging. Then, it doesn‚Äôt jive.   Easily overlooked.
  @VladPasca5 Thanks so much for reading it, Vlad.
  Just a short one today.  Hopefully, you found some nuggets in here to improve your service business next year.  If you found this valuable, give me a follow for weekly threads on entrepreneurship &amp; internet income ‚Üí @justinsaas  Have a wonderful last week of 2021.  Cheers.
  TL;DR  1. Ask for feedback from customers early &amp; often 2. Understand the part of your business they love 3. Document feelings about what you enjoy 4. Find the intersection of numbers 2 &amp; 3 5. Adjust messaging across the web 6. Ask for testimonials ruthlessly 7. Raise your rates
  5/ Increase your rates  Now you have a:  - Niche - Ideal customer - Crystal clear offer - Plenty of social proof  Now double your rates.  Even if you lose 2x more deals, you'll make the same money and work 50% of the time.  Keep pushing your rates until the math doesn't work.
  4/ Testimonials  Testimonials improve conversion from web visitor ‚Üí booked call  It‚Äôs also a key driver behind price increases.  Your goal is to get testimonials from customers in your niche.  This will greatly improve the likelihood of booked calls from future great customers.
  3/ Clarify  With your newly optimized business, it's time to adjust messaging.  Start with:  - Content - Website - Sales pitch - Social profiles - Landing pages  Make it crystal clear who you work with, what you help them do, and how you help them do it.  This is your new niche.
  2/ Optimize  Next, optimize your business by:  - Developing &amp; expanding areas you and your customer enjoy.  - Eliminating things you and your customers don‚Äôt.  You want to find the intersection of what you enjoy &amp; what customers want more of.  That's ALL your going to focus on.
  1/ Get feedback  First, you need to understand what part of your business customers love and want more of.  Ask simple questions:  - Where do your customers get the most value from you?  - What do they wish they could get more of?  - Don't forget: what do YOU enjoy the most?

  @Varun-Bosmia I've dabbled on LinkedIn.
  I want to know more incredible solopreneurs.  In 2022, I'm going to be shining a light on more one-person businesses in my newsletter.  Tell me - who should I be following?
  @akramquraishi Get everyone aligned and hold people accountable.
  @GregoryCronie Correct.
  @GregoryCronie When I was a SaaS executive, always quarterly.  For my family, I prefer yearly but may adjust in the future.  No specific reason for yearly, just feels right.
  @BigWillieStein Great point.  Also, add risk and adjusted game plan for risk.
  @jackhilbrich Great question.  For the most part, I let my prospects and customers guide me. It's the easiest way to make a good choice.  At the same time, I've been in the space for 3 years, and I know what people actually need, plus how to create the me
  @jackhilbrich I break down my business this way.  I know how many impressions, visitors, etc. I need each day for each product and service. Then, I go find them.
  @theashleyfrank Anything that's impactful that becomes a chore ceases to continue its impact.  OKR planning with my wife is one of my favorite things to do.
  @PKGingDisruptor Yep.  Building my family OKRs this week.
  @Mr-M-E We get so bogged down in the minutia that it becomes difficult to pull back.  If you haven't yet, this is your week to make it happen.
  Welcome to the most underrated week of the year.  Time to disconnect from tactics &amp; focus on strategy:  - Objectives - Key results - Distribution - Systems &amp; support  Then, how do you break yearly goals into daily action?  Remember: Your year is simply the aggregate of your days.
  @dickiebush Writing and business both.   Start with one customer that has one very distinct problem.   Solve that and you have yourself the start of a business.
  @SimonHoiberg I reversed.   Started on LinkedIn. Built to 120k.  Then, added Twitter about 12 weeks ago, and the diversification has been great.  New audience, new insights, new ideas.   But, I'm glad I started by going deep on one rather than managing 2

  @damengchen I literally just set up my 2nd wall.   So pumped.
  Teach yourself skills you want to learn before asking someone else to help.  Sometimes you'll fail and have to find an expert.  But the habit of self-teaching is critical.
  @imetbrian - LinkedIn - Twitter - Blog - Community
  @ErinBalsa I‚Äôm in the process and will happily share when done.
  @heyeaslo @dickiebush Excellent thread. Nice work...
  @SahilBloom Mid-workday lunch with the fam.   Never regretted once.
  @acamwriter Do the latter. Let your readers direct you.
  @growthcurrency Thanks my man! Great list.
  @Kellen-the-man Thanks for that. Much appreciated.
  @alemaoinvestor Writing is a great way to understand something.   Find something you‚Äôre curious about and write what you learn.   You‚Äôll get smarter and people who are interested in the topic will likely read your stuff. Win/win.
  @alemaoinvestor Mostly about building SaaS companies because that's what I was doing.
  @Johnbryant1997 Good call.
  @Kellen-the-man Yeah, that's not a bad point.
  @thecorsta Yep. Good call.

  @ThePupOfWallSt Congrats!
  @PatrickMignault Great question.  I considered something "written" when I published it out into the universe. That was it for me.
  @jessievbreugel Thanks, man! I appreciate that.  It's wild to look back on. I'm not great with many habits, but this has been one of them.
  @fmatatome I don't really, but my goal is to at least create one piece of short-form content that I feel good shipping.  This post would be an example of bare minimum.
  @wadboy- Definitely.   Writing helps me make sense of the content I consume.
  @BenjaminPutano I missed when I genuinely felt uncreative. Even then, I technically "wrote" something.  But not enough for it to be shipped.  Generally a good nights sleep, a walk, and some coffee kept me going.
  I committed to writing daily 36 months ago. Here are my results:  ‚Üí 84.7% adherence ‚Üí 1,300+ unique pieces ‚Üí 165,000+ new social followers  Not 100%, but what a wild journey.  I'm convinced habitual writing makes any entrepreneur better.

  @mistamor I don't actually have a script for this ask because it's personal. If you use templates to make critical asks to important people, it just doesn't work...
  Well...that's it for today.  Hope you found some nuggets you can apply to your journey.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me for more threads on entrepreneurship ‚Üí @justinsaas  2. Here‚Äôs another thread of mine you might enjoy:  https://t.co/3zVqEe0ggx  Be kind in 2022 üëã
  15/ Remember  In the end, I remembered that life is short.  Too many days in front of the computer means too few days with my beautiful wife.  The computer, business, revenue, and social media will always be there.  Our precious time with loved ones will not.  Remember that.
  14/ Seek  To better broaden my worldview, I also sought out those who think differently about the world than I do.  Different politics. Different cultures. Different viewpoints.  It was enriching and allowed me to empathize with people I normally wouldn't.  Conversation &gt; news
  13/ Relax  2019 &amp; 2020 were years where I felt frustrated on social media.  I was succeeding in building my network and businesses, but politics &amp; the world were upsetting.  So, in 2021, I turned it all off.   Eliminated Twitter trends. Blocked news sites.  Talk about relaxing.
  12/ Eliminate  In balancing my businesses, I was doing a lot of things I didn't like doing.  So, I just started saying no to things I didn't enjoy.  The easiest way for me to do this was with "No" templates.  Shout out to @thepatwalls for his "How to Say No" series.  Lifesaver.
  11/ Diversify  Until late 2021, I was on one social platform: LinkedIn  I had grown to 130k+ followers but had always felt a bit timid on Twitter.  12 weeks ago, I decided to just go for it.  The result? 26k followers interested in my journey.  Diversify where you create.
  10/ Listen  My businesses really started taking off when I remembered that my customers tell me what to create next.  Instead of building what I wanted, I asked more questions and listened intently to the answers.  The result?   A $305k improvement in product sales.
  9/ Ask  You don't get what you don't ask for.   That doesn't mean ask willy nilly. It means being smart with my asks.  In 2021 I talked to people I never would have imagined speaking to.  Interviewed amazing guests.  Was featured on sites I felt were out of my reach.  Ask!
  8/ Give  In 2020, I didn't give much back in terms of my time or money. I was overwhelmed.  Candidly, it made me feel a lack of purpose.  This year, I've spent a lot of time giving away my time, donating to causes I support, &amp; finding ways to spread love anonymously.  Purpose ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  7/ Collaborate  2021 was all about collaboration for me.  Built an incredible community of over 500 people across 51 countries.  Just jamming out on Slack, building in public, releasing products, and supporting one another.  More focus on relationships in 2022.
  6/ Ignore  With over 165k social media followers across 2 channels, you get a lot of nasty comments.  People are mean. Angry. Condescending. Cruel. Shitty.  I got really aggressive with the block button in 2021.  My content, my mental health, my rules.
  5/ Rest  In 2019, I burned out at my executive job.  In mid-2021, I was running the risk of doing the same as a creator.  My solution?  - 6 mile daily walks - 30-minute built-in breaks - One day per week off (failed)  2 out of 3 ain't bad.   In 2022, I'll be better.
  4/ Focus  I've spent time as a SaaS advisor, coach, mentor, investor, and digital product creator.  2021 was the first year I really spent the majority of my time focused on product.  2020 product revenue: 19% of income 2021 product revenue: 52% of revenue  Income up. Time down.
  3/ Repurpose  My business runs on content.  And after writing unique pieces every day for over 2 years, I finally started to repurpose  It made me nervous.  The outcome?  Nobody noticed and the pieces were widely read by people who had never seen them the first time around.
  2/ Reduce  My 4 businesses run on so many pieces of technology.  Bills add up, things break, and opportunities are missed.  I cut a bunch of technology and folded all of my businesses into a new site, launching soon.  All-in-one tech makes things so much more manageable.

  @SeanAnthonySays @thedankoe  https://t.co/4ZAUI0giUf
  @engeniusprep @categorypirates Negative present and positive future are 2 very important sales and marketing lessons.
  Entrepreneurs need great content to attract customers.  Ask yourself these 2 questions before you hit publish:  "Does this content challenge my prospect's thinking?" "Does this content teach my prospect something new?"  If either is a "yes", you're more likely to have a winner.
  @thedankoe Thanks for asking great questions. It's a rarity these days.
  @thedankoe has one of the realest podcasts around.  Enjoyed spending some time with him chatting about:  - Life - Health - Business - Products - and more...  Give it a listen if you have some time.
  @MattMHarriman Always.  The dream is the customer's future state.   Your product has to deliver...
  @thenocodepro Nailed it. (Construction pun)
  @dickiebush - Being autodidactic - Focusing on self-care - Learning how to say no
  Happy Monday to entrepreneurs selling the dream, not the product.
  @DBarnettMoncton @girdley @SullyBusiness LinkedIn automation is the worst.
  @GoodsCapital Almost never. I‚Äôm an introvert.
  @linkedin-king @jkostecki-rei @SanchizeUnfltrd @girdley @SullyBusiness @mrshadeed Good stuff. No one way to skin a cat, as we're seeing.  It's a great platform for solopreneurs, entrepreneurs, and creators.  Built my 140k followers organically over 3 year
  @GoodsCapital @girdley @SullyBusiness @sweatystartup I'm a one-man show. It's a lot of work, but I enjoy it.  I don't ever want to outsource content or engagement. Feels too inauthentic.
  @girdley @SullyBusiness I‚Äôve found almost nobody is.   Most people are executive coaches, e-commerce folks, financial people, etc.

  Happy Saturday to entrepreneurs who know therapy is growth.
  @NathanClark- Haha. I'm old.  I don't know these newfangled acronyms.   But, I'm certainly aware of it after this Tweet.
  @FreedomWriter0 Not really.  You can automate tasks, emails, responses, payments, etc. right from the beginning.
  @rebelmktr @IAgreeWithYou- Also an option. Whatever gets you away from that computer.
  Most entrepreneurs talking about freedom are actually obsessed with work.  Real freedom comes with:  - Elimination - Automation - Delegation  Sitting in front of the computer for 16 hours doesn't make you "free".  Take this weekend to E.A.D.
  Happy Friday to entrepreneurs who realize psychology is just as important as marketing.
  @jspector Absolutely brilliant. Great template.  I'm in the process of piping all of my website inquiries into AirTable. My "no" templates are installed, and changing a status triggers them to send for different things:  - No to podcast - No to brain pick
  Key skill for entrepreneurs:  Say "no" to most requests for your time.  You probably don't need to be on that podcast.   You need uninterrupted work.
  Happy Thursday to the entrepreneurs clearing their calendar.
  How to start an online coaching business:  1. Learn how to solve one specific challenge 2. Create content to help your audience 3. Build a landing page on Carrd 4. Embed Gumroad or Stripe 5. Publish your new website 6. Promote your business 7. Ask people to buy 8. Get paid
  @ryancwalkr Definitely applies to more than online course marketing, but I see people miss this 101 in that space, in particular.   Mostly because they aren't marketers or salespeople, just solopreneurs who have never sold themselves.
  @thenocodepro Love that addition. Thanks, Sahil.
  @MentalWeapons Answer all of their worries and objections in the copy.
  Online course marketing 101:  Your offer should answer, "What, exactly, will customers achieve?"  It's not: "Learn how to invest in the market."  It's: "In less than 1 hour, you'll learn to invest your first $10k in the market without an expensive advisor."  Clarity is critical.
  Happy Wednesday to entrepreneurs firing customers who don't treat them well.

  @rebelmktr Correct. My mistake.
  @OmerTheus Yep. Turns out you don‚Äôt have to be that smart hence my point üòÇ
  @Alec-Coughlin  https://t.co/dbC5Nts0Dv
  @cedriclee77 I've heard this story so many times...happens to a lot of folks.
  The best entrepreneurs I know aren't always "smart".  They‚Äôre autonomous.  Learning how to teach yourself is a skill worth building.
  Happy Sunday to everyone building slowly &amp; sustainably.
  @joshgcalderon Sure but building anything (in public or otherwise) comes with doubters and trolls.  The upside (in my opinion) drastically outweighs the downside.
  The upside of building in public:  - More intrigue - More attention - More conversations - Better feedback loop  The downside is what people will think of you.  Once you realize they don't, the downside goes away.

  @andymewborn True story.
  Happy Saturday to everyone drinking their own Kool-Aid.
  @vickks @JustiniSaaS Thank you!
  @vickks @JustiniSaaS Can you please report this account?
  @Aniketmlive @decentraliens @Bazzaruto Well shit. Thanks man.
  @acamwriter Thanks for the shout, Alex. Much appreciated.
  @JoshMcKain Nice! That's what I hoped.
  @trainedwright Thanks for reading it. Appreciate it!
  @thecorsta Thanks man! Happy holidays.
  If you're a startup operator, you likely have the skills for entrepreneurship.  If you fail, you'll probably fail right back into the same game.  2022 is a great year to test this hypothesis.
  @cedriclee77 @ayushtweetshere @arvidkahl @MeetKevon @thisiskp- There are very few people building in public on LinkedIn. Sounds like an opportunity to me.  I did this with my second-most recent course and did over $40k in sales during the build phase. Def
  @thedankoe @rufaimunye @BrianFeroldi @warikoo @aaraalto @JamesonCamp Much appreciated üí™
  @joshfrank Welcome to the team. It's a different platform with different ups/downs but it's great for building an audience...
  @mynameis-davis God damn. This is hilarious. üòÇ
  @thenocodepro True fans, yes. Obviously, the more, the better.
  @BGroat Not a shabby goal.
  @ash-lmb Used to be Gumroad, but now I pipe people from Gumroad to Teachable for a better experience.   Teachable's checkout page has way too many fields.
  The successful solopreneur playbook:  - One niche - 100 true fans - One massive problem - One systematized solution  Stop overcomplicating it.
  @Tim-Denning I think we were going to find some time. Shoot me a note to justinwelsh@hey.com and let's grab some time in the new year?
  @Tim-Denning Awesome takeaways, Tim. I'm going to be adding a few things into my arsenal in 2022. Not sure what yet, but excited to report back.
  And that's it for today.  If you found this thread valuable:  1. Toss me a follow for more threads on entrepreneurship and internet income ‚Üí @justinsaas  2. Enjoyed this? Here‚Äôs another similar thread of mine you might enjoy:  https://t.co/P06K4A084k

  - No 30-day email course. - No complicated integrations. - No audience segmentation. - No abandoned cart emails.  None of these things are bad btw.   They would probably help me increase sales.  But they aren't necessary to start &amp; be successful.  So 
  7/ Create an army of happy customers who sell  After completing the course, customers receive an invite to become an affiliate.  It doesn't drive a ton of sales, but so far I've made $5,760 in 5 months.  Not bad.  https://t.co/T709iB6W16
  6/ Automate testimonials  When the course is completed, I embed a  https://t.co/DNeY0WF8u7 button inside of the last lesson.  The ask is simple. A short video or text testimonial.  Then it automatically gets pumped to my landing page.  Check it out:  https://t.co/QkTjmWgunS
  5/ Deliver 100x value  Part of the "impulse buy" strategy is to surprise and delight the customer.  "I spent 2k on a Copywriting coach in January... Learned more in this $150 course than I did working with them." - Jubal Horton  This the feedback I'm after üëÜüèª  https://t.co/FukPqz7vBi
  4/ Create urgency with discounts  A simple 25% to 40% expiring discount (24 hours only) drives purchases.  A well-crafted ask + impulse pricing + expiring deal = sales  I average about $14k in 24 hours when I ask.   It gets seen by 50k to 80k people.  https://t.co/HFbOePOmS2
  3/ "Impulse buy" pricing  The amount of trust you need to build to sell a $1,297 masterclass takes is insane.  When people come across my products (especially on "ask" days), I want them to "pull the trigger" without thinking.  Make it easy.  $50 to $150  https://t.co/a00I6IuA2V
  2/ 80% give, 20% ask  As you continue giving away valuable information, you earn the right to make an "ask".  Once per week, I ask my audience to buy a course.  I make about 15x the revenue each "ask day".  See @gumroad  screenshot (a few more asks bc of Holiday sales)  https://t.co/u8euqwuIT7
  1/ Continuous value in a niche  I spent a few years on LinkedIn talking about social media growth on the platform.  All of my best lessons already exist as content. They are all free.  The good news is people will pay for aggregation.
  @aakashg0 @LBacaj @daretorant @will-mannon @AnaAlexandraZ Thank you, my man.
  Happy Thursday to everyone nailing the basics.
  @bruce-v3 I was confused by what subscriptions for my notion pages meant. I can charge for subscriptions? Create subscriptions using notion? I can pay for notion as a subscription?  Obviously I figured it out but it took 5-7 seconds.
  @caan-al I get to some pages and I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶what IS this?
  99% of landing pages I see don't clearly tell me:  - Who you help - What you help them do - How you help them do it  Too much clever.  Not enough clarity.
  @Josh-G-Roth You missed my ‚ÄúLane Kiffin short tenure‚Äù joke. Damn.

  @thenocodepro @Quora Haha. Had 280 characters and eliminated Quora. Great call, man.
  The number of places solopreneurs can promote their business is wild:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - HackerNews - Indie Hackers - Facebook Groups - Private Slack/Discord  If you're distributing to one channel, please repurpose.  Different customers hang in different channels.

  @JamesonCamp I'm with ya.  Own a niche, and build a portfolio of products.   Start by delivering incredible value at a low price to set the tone.   Gradually increase prices as people learn you're serious about rooting for their success and supporting it

  @FahadHassan That's not necessarily true.  In my last business, we listened to prospective customers and then built a software product.   We never built a service business...
  @LearnEveryyDay Sure thing.  Lots of careers (for example, carpenter) have a pretty standard path.   Many (for example, content creator) can be reached through thousands of different, varying paths.  That's why a step-by-step "how to" guide is much less v
  @adam-dimitrov Yep. Or treating Twitter (or another platform) as a place where people can come and learn a lot about a specific topic.
  The less predictable your career path, the less helpful "how-to" advice is.   Becoming a carpenter has a pretty straight-line path.  Becoming a professional content creator doesn't.  Don't follow someone else's step-by-step guide only to find out their luck isn't on your side.
  @CharlesWeill Thanks, Charles!
  @TazBurwaiss I think servicing clients 1:1 first means a much more robust and relevant product.
  @mar15sa @remoteworkprep This is exactly how I built my business as well.
  @GraemeCrawley- I think that would be a broad statement so probably not, but businesses in a similar niche likely do.   I think learning how to solve those individual challenges 1:1 with a client is the perfect lead in to a product.
  @AlexLlullTW Serve and listen.   Once you fully understand the appropriate solution, productization becomes significantly easier.
  @thenocodepro Because you better understand the challenges your prospective customers have.
  Counterintuitive observation:  Building a service business is a great way to eventually build a product business.

  @JamesSAlberts Yep. It‚Äôs that people can‚Äôt fluidly transition from one task to another without losing steam.   Prep, follow up, getting back in the groove, checking social, email, grabbing a drink of water, etc.   Deep focus is so necessary.
  Time management 101 for solopreneurs:  Keep context switching to a minimum.  30-minute meetings end up costing you 1.5 hours.  The deeper you get into your business, the more important it is to be wise with your time.  Write out templates for saying no to anything.

  @jessievbreugel Awesome. Thanks for giving it a read, man. Appreciated.
  @jashan-lallar Thanks for recapping, Jashan üí™
  Practicing yours using the 7 steps gives you a consistent answer to the "tell us your backstory" question.  It's great for:  - Content - Podcasts - Webinars - Your "about" section - Sharing with prospects  When you get it right, it's a massive sales &amp; marketing asset.
  Telling a compelling story isn't just for startup founders, though.  It's for anyone building a business online.  And everyone who has a story you admire has absolutely crafted it.  Here's a simple cheat sheet you can reference when you're putting yours together:  https://t.co/TI3Nr76eC2
  7/ The Result  The result is the continuation of the story to even greater success, leading up to your present situation.  My example: I never looked back. I got promoted multiple times and went on to become an executive at a startup company in LA at age 33.
  6/ The Guide  The guide in the story is the person who lifts you up and helps you see your potential for what it really is.  My example: After years of making no sales in my previous jobs, my boss Ryan went out with me on my first day and helped me make a sale.
  5/ The Spark  The spark is that magic moment when you realize everything is about to change.  When you went from feeling completely disconnected to reinvigorated.  My example: When I started working at ZocDoc, I was sparked by the product, the people, and the energy of the city.
  4/ The Change Event  The change event is the critical decision you made that leads you from your struggle to your newfound transformation.  My example: I took a bus ride from Allentown, Pennsylvania to New York City to interview at a small technology company called ZocDoc.
  3/ The External Struggles  External struggles can be seen or heard.   An over-drafted bank account, a lost job, a poor living situation.  My example: My buddies made fun of me for living in tiny towns &amp; getting fired.   A girlfriend even dumped me because I had too much debt.
  2/ The Internal Struggles  Internal struggles are how we feel inside because of the obstacle above.  Internal pain is captured with words like fearful, insecure, or worried.  My example: After getting fired 3x, I was worried that I was never going to be successful at anything.
  1/ The Obstacle  To start, it's important that your audience can relate to your story.  And there's one critical thing that's relatable to anyone:  Overcoming an obstacle.  My example: I got fired 3 times by the time I was 28 and was basically a failure heading into 2010.
  The greatest founders in the world all have something in common.  A "founder story" that's a massive marketing asset.  Follow this 7-step framework to create yours...  [üßµthread]

  @VladPasca5 Definitely. If I write 3%, everyone has a conniption, though.
  @danthewolfe Yep. It's a lot less anxiety-inducing when you break it down to the nitty-gritty.
  @SelimChehimi No, LinkedIn.   I have a much larger following there.   https://t.co/2q0HmOU9mR
  @SelimChehimi I operate at a roughly 98% margin.   I do zero paid ads (never have) and have a few hundred bucks per month in technology costs.  Mostly, it's just my time.
  @pedr0luna I'd recommend you start with a service business, then productize.   https://t.co/mfPl5C9F05
  Making $200k/yr selling info products broken down:  - $16.7k per month - Which is ~$540/day - Which is 4 customers @ $135/ea - Which is 285 daily web visitors at 1.4% conversion  None of this is easy.  But it's certainly easier than staring $200k in the face without a plan.

  @miloshjokic I love that. Keep it going, man. Thinking about adding some SaaS to my portfolio in 2022.
  You won't do anything special without a little risk.  Those at the top of their fields nearly always took some small risks.  - The idea - The execution - The go-to-market - The advertising plan  Don't be catastrophically foolish.  But take some well-calculated chances.
  @mijustin @dvassallo That makes sense.  I was thinking more about social progress versus progress related to design and planning, but I certainly understand your point.
  @dvassallo @mijustin Devil's advocate:  By slowing progress to address consequences, we simply shift the consequences toward those who are desperate for faster progress.  Note: I'm neither a conservative nor a progressive.

  Life gets easier once you realize the entrepreneurs you admire are just like you.  A more consistent, curious, &amp; less risk-averse version of you.  So, if you want to join them, you only have 2 options:  - A: Get started. - B: Don't.  Option A is scary, but option B is scarier.
  If you found this thread valuable:  1. Follow me for more threads on entrepreneurship, business, and content creation ‚Üí @JustinSaaS  2. Here‚Äôs another thread of mine you might enjoy:  https://t.co/vmbZo8pro2
  Step 5: Stay consistent  Writing consistently is the most important step of all.  Here's the TL;DR:  ‚Ä¢ Ideate with topics/structures ‚Ä¢ Format with tools like Typeshare ‚Ä¢ Edit with tools like Hemingway ‚Ä¢ Distribute with tools like HypeFury
  Step 4: Distribute widely  99% of people I talk to waste distribution opportunities.  You've already written something.   Why not share it everywhere that's relevant?  I use @Hypefury to send my content to Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.  The tool is powerful.  https://t.co/YKNil9PJsL
  Step 3: Edit ruthlessly  No easier way to lose a reader than unclear writing.  So, once I'm done, I pass my writing through @HemingwayApp  It tells me:  - The grade level - Poor word choices - Poor sentence structure  Paste in your writing and see where you can simplify.  https://t.co/drBmGUwC7U
  Step 2: Choose a solid format  Struggling to format your writing?  There are so many tools out there to help.  I am loving @typeshare-co  They have beautiful templates built right in for inspiration.  No better way to get started.  https://t.co/5EhrScjNWe
  Step 1: Ideate rapidly  What‚Äôs the fastest way to come up with ideas?  Use systems.  I created my own content matrix in Notion.  - Choose a topic - Match it to a style - Write a quick headline - Repeat until you have 10 ideas  Much of writing is about systems.  https://t.co/HVdg7myRZf

  7/ You must market hard  I don't just mean to get people onto your waitlist, or interested.   I mean marketing to people who have already expressed interest.  People are busy. They forget to apply. They forget to pay.  72-hour, 24-hour, and 2-hour reminders work wonders.
  6/ The community software space needs help  If you want synchronous conversation, you're left hacking together a bunch of tools.  - Member directory - Resource center - Events - Real-time conversation  IMO, there is not a single company doing all of this extremely well.
  5/ It's rewarding  We already have hundreds of member wins and stories of new business being closed.  People are seeing dramatic growth in their social media following and pipeline.  It feels amazing to be helping people that put their trust in me.
  4/ It's time-consuming.  I spend 8-10 hours per day working in the community, which is a lot given the current MRR.  The upside is that more members don't necessarily equal more work.   As this scales, I believe community management will provide me with more time.
  3/ Synchronous conversation is intense.  We chose Discord (then Slack) because I had a hypothesis that synchronous conversation would be important.  It seems to be proving true so far, but there are complaints about it being overwhelming.  I wish I had done more research.
  2/ Early culture is key  We put people through a robust application process to deeply understand who they are.  We set expectations 3x on who should join and who shouldn't.   We emphasized the importance of creativity, participation, etc.  Our first 4 cohorts are amazing.
  1/ Outcomes matter  It's critical that everyone is focused on the same outcome.  I have 130k followers on LinkedIn, so some people applied just to hang out.  Those members don't engage as much because the outcomes we're working towards aren't why they joined.   Be thorough.

  @ImraneDessai Great question. A better word for "no-brainer" is "impulse buy".   If something is mildly interesting to me and it's $50, I'll probably buy it on impulse. If it's $250, I won't.  I think $30-$99 is a good "impulse buy" range.
  @kevinbooyens It's a great way to simply get started. You can evolve very easily over time, which is great.
  @VladPasca5 Appreciate you reading it, Vlad!
  @JohnathanBarnes Yes, this is exactly how I do it.   Coaching is hourly, one-off stuff and consulting/advising is retainer based.
  @LearnEveryyDay Thank you, Jason. Appreciate you sharing it.
  Get started.   üëÜüèªThat's the key  If this was helpful, feel free to RT or give me a follow.  I'm  building 4, one-person businesses to over $5M in revenue.  Have any questions? Ask away.   Happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading.
  10/ Set up your systems  - Create useful content - Drive people to the product - Upsell 1:1 coaching packages  With this simple system it's only a matter of time before you add a 3rd income stream:  - Consulting - Community - Physical products - Cohort-based coaching  Next?
  9/ Raise your rates  With a lower-priced product, you can now increase your coaching rates.  When people want coaching, you can coach.  When they don't, tell them about your digital product.  You now have an offering for different learning styles and price points.
  8/ Build a digital product  Your 2nd income stream is your first digital product. Focused on the most common problem above.  Take someone from problem to solution in 45 minutes or less.  Keep it focused.  Single problem ‚Üí single solution  Price it reasonably to build trust.
  7/ Listen for commonalities  This is a key step to creating your 2nd income stream.  Your goal when coaching is to listen for the most common problems of your students.  - Write down every problem you hear - Dive deeper to understand them - Keep a running list  This is the gold.
  6/ Promote it  It's unlikely you'll get clients just because your business exists.  Instead, find easy ways to promote it.  When your new followers ask you questions, tell them about your coaching business.  When you write content, share a link at the end.  Simple stuff.
  5/ Create a service business  A simple coaching business can be your 1st income stream.  Put up an MVP landing page and use @stripe to collect payments.  The key? Make the pricing a no-brainer.  You're not looking to get rich here, you're looking to learn. (more on this)
  4/ Create content  Next, it's time to establish credibility.  Here are some easy ways:  - Teardowns - Tweet threads - Step-by-step guides  Show the people 2-3 years behind you that you understand their challenges &amp; have solved them before.  This will gain you a small following.
  3/ Find the "you" from 2-3 years ago  Your goal is to find people who are just like you, but much earlier in their journey.  Where do they hang out online? Try places like:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - FB Groups  If you can't find them, use tools like @sparktoro to help.
  2/ Identify your interests  Inside of the list you just created, will be things you loved doing and hated doing.  Sorry, but misery doesn't scale.  Choose something you built skills in, that you also enjoy doing/talking about/writing about.  This will be your focus.
  1/ Eliminate the "fallacy of expertise"  When you get started, you can't worry about "am I an expert?"  If you do, you'll never get started.  Instead, make a list of your accomplishments, big and small, over the last 2-3 years.  What skills did you learn during this period?

  @ImraneDessai It certainly can.
  Don't sell a digital product without building some credibility.  Instead:  - Figure out who you love spending time with - Talk to them about their challenges - Learn how to solve them - Share what you learn - Repeat  Do this, and you'll build a wonderful reputation.  Then sell.

  @bushwik @damengchen Ooh, great add. Thanks, Todd!
  Well, that's all for today.  If this was helpful, feel free to RT or give me a follow.  I'm currently building 4, one-person businesses to over $5M in revenue.  Have any questions? Ask away.   Happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading.
  12/ Zapier  No list would be complete without @zapier   Never has one tool made me feel like the whole world of technology is at my fingertips.  From building simple pass-through Zaps, to complex, multi-step Zaps, Zapier makes anything possible by combining technologies.
  11/ Notion  @NotionHQ is basically the master hub for my whole life. In Notion I:  - Host my roadmap - Manage my to-do list - Write all of my content - Store my process docs - And much more...  And I'm still learning how to use it most effectively.
  10/ HypeFury  @Yannick-Veys added new features that have recently turned it from good to "I can't live without this".  Scheduling Tweets, crafting threads, being inspired, sending to other social media, running sales...  It does everything for the content writer.  A must-buy.
  9/  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I  Strong testimonials are a great way to improve conversion.  Nothing makes it easier and more impactful than  https://t.co/DNeY0WF8u7  I embed it in my course, and users can leave video/text testimonials that automatically appear on my landing pages.
  8/ Loom  @loom is my favorite tool for:  - Building video process docs - Building out my online courses - Doing video walkthroughs for my community - Teaching someone how a piece of software works  Simple, easy to install, and tracks visitor/watcher analytics.
  7/ Fathom Analytics  Looking at Google Analytics can be confusing for some folks.  @usefathom is simple, privacy-first, cookie-free, and GDPR compliant.  Plus, with just a glance, I know exactly what is impacting my website traffic.   Great service.
  6/ Calendly  @Calendly means I don't need a VA for scheduling, nor do I need any time-consuming back and forth.  Anything that requires scheduling a meeting, a simple Calendly embed works wonders.  I also drop it on my website for paid coaching calls.
  5/ AirTable  @airtable keeps my entire advising business thriving and organized.  Collecting information through forms, automating email triggers, building Kanban charts, and collaborating with my wife are just some of the things I love doing to manage my business.
  4/ Outseta  Thinking about launching a community or SaaS product?   @outseta is your tool.   A CRM, payments, subscriptions, email automation, gated content, segmentation, etc...  Outseta is loaded with great features and functionality at an extremely fair price.
  3/ Canva  @canva has made me into my own personal graphic designer.  Whether it's Twitter banners, icons, logos, landing page graphics, Instagram posts, you name it...  Canva makes it as easy as drag-and-drop to start designing.
  2/ Gumroad  For digital products, nothing is easier and faster than @gumroad  I can think of a product/service and have it fully embedded on my Carrd landing page in less than 10 minutes.  This lets me start pre-selling fast to get the validation I need to continue.
  1/ Carrd  @carrd is the fastest and easiest way to build websites.  It's great for personal sites or standing up landing pages quickly.  I use it for nearly everything I do because it makes getting started extremely simple.
  I‚Äôve done over $1M in income in 2 years as an entrepreneur.  And I didn't write a single line of code.  My 12 "must use" no-code tools:  [üßµ thread}
  @Nicolascole77 "Be authentic" and "add value" are platitudes that require a lot more context.  Owning a niche is where it's at. A niche of one.
  @agazdecki You'd better love talking to them and be fully invested in solving their most pressing problems.  If you've got those things, you're going to be in a much better position to succeed long-term.
  @GerardDawson3 Yep. Get it out there and see what people want to know more about.

  @sleepy-l0c0 @GeorgeNoble07 I wish I could sell myself that.
  @Batulkr- I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the issue at all.   I see plenty of successful entrepreneurs who sell a solution to a pain they never personally went through.   The market eliminates fakers.
  @BenjaminPutano Not with the way I approach entrepreneurship.  I'm not trying to build a unicorn.  If I can build 4 companies that do $250k in annual revenue, even if they stay stagnant...I'm pretty happy.
  @trevorgodfrey- I'm actually writing a thread on my entire no-code stack for tomorrow. Stay tuned and it will be helpful.
  @dougzhotmess The best way to learn is to get started.
  @trevorgodfrey- Yep. Everything I build is no-code. Just get started quickly and validate the problem/solution.
  @KathWertheim @Uber @lyft As someone who cannot code, all I really think about is tech-enabled services.   If you can build that, the next big idea is just one thought away.
  @ChristineCarril The more you can find existing, poorly operated ideas and fix them...the more likely you are to think of that big idea when you least expect it.
  @BenjaminPutano Looking at it through this lens has allowed me to see so many new opportunities where I used to see nothing.
  You don't need a flashy new idea to build a business.  Go find:  - Antiquated industries - Slow companies - Poor service  Use technology to do a better job and you'll likely start chipping away.  A much easier lens to view entrepreneurship through.
  @derekmertins Always.
  @stephenpratley It should be so hard, that the customer can't figure it out. Who can?  You.

  @GeorgeNoble07 100%. The bigger the pain, the more I'm willing to pay.
  Too many entrepreneurs are selling products or services for problems they haven't validated as painful.  The more existential the pain, the more people buy.
  @jayd3sai @amandanat @ChrisWalker171 @camilletrent @davegerhardt Thank you, my man. Funny enough, I‚Äôm most commonly referred to as a marketer. I‚Äôll take it. üëè

  Happy Sunday to those of you building an intentional life through solopreneurship.
  @JayMacFounder Appreciate it, Jay. Happy Sat.
  Happy Saturday to everyone working to impress themselves, not others.
  @cjaythecreator Probably not. Good point.
  @lesgreys Appreciate that, Les. Lmk how it goes!
  @Supreet84421577 I‚Äôve found nearly all advice is contextual.   Universally, I‚Äôd say understanding your customers will always get your farther than relying on expert opinions.
  @disknotifier Don't listen to me, listen to them.
  @isthisReda Their words certainly matter more than someone without a whole lot of context.
  Less time listening to experts.   More time listening to customers.
  @dickiebush Great stuff, Dickie.  Join a few communities and watch for the most common questions.   Dig in, and look for the clear gap in knowledge and then fill it.  Great writers solve problems with clear and concise language and guidance.  Love this.

  @diegoquendoo Limited downside unlimited upside
  @SocialQui 100%. Meeting great people through public building is a win.
  @andreasjonssonn Great point
  The upside of building in public:  - More intrigue - More attention - More conversations - Better feedback loop  The downside is what people will think of you.  Once you realize they don't, the downside goes away.

  @jasonleowsg Had one major thread that drove a lot.

  @Hunckler Gotcha.  1. Don't know, but probably 95%+  I haven't been good at interacting with other accounts. If you look at my recent Tweets, you'll see the engagement comes from them.  2. I don't believe any of it was repurposed. Maybe a few lines here a
  @Hunckler Do you mean was my content original or repurposed?
  @CSMikeCardona @philostar I think it's likely that work becomes more fluid. I don't think about it as 4 or 5 days, rather, how do I get my work done successfully?   I don't do polls, but you could try one.
  @brendanjshort Damn. That's a lot to live up to :)
  @philostar Tweet every day and stay focused on your target audience.  Every week or so, share a thread that goes deeper into what you've learned/are learning.
  @iamcesarromero Awesome, appreciate the support, Cesar.
  @LiamKircher #3 is unacceptable.
  @LiamKircher 3 buckets of no shows IMO.  1. Reaches out and says they can't make it: I'll book again.  2. Doesn't show, reaches back out with a very valid reason: I'll book once more.  3. Doesn't show, doesn't reach out: I'll never book again.  Wasting so
  @thealexbanks In-depth threads seem to work the best but require the most effort. Outside of that, just sharing what I'm working on and staying on message consistently.

  @SullyBusiness Ha. Hardly. Just getting my sea legs.
  12 days ago, I decided to write daily on Twitter for one year.  2.12M impressions and 5,014 new friends later...   This appears to have been a smart move.  https://t.co/AvgcyBPj02

  @jasonleowsg It hasn't always been a prerequisite but is certainly becoming more so.
  @jasonleowsg I have an advising business that takes about 4 hours per week or so.  I have 2 digital products which require no time.  I run a community that requires 7-10 hours per week.  This new idea is a tech-enabled service business that I could likely

  @sachin-ramje Congrats Sachin! Signing up now.
  @ThePupOfWallSt I don‚Äôt. Should I?
  @Shresth3Avishek It‚Äôs a tech-enabled service so no major buildout required.
  @brian1625 @chrishlad Other people are laughing.   Cue mine.
  @chrishlad It‚Äôs something that blends into the background but when you isolate it and think about it you‚Äôre like‚Ä¶wait, what?
  @chrishlad Laugh tracks.
  @yosoyMH Promote it to a small section of my email list or my community and then put it through the process, create process docs, look for problems, get feedback etc
  @alixedi Amazing! So, we're not alone in our inspiration? :)
  @sachin-ramje Boom. can't wait to see it!
  @mistamor @sachin-ramje I'm going to soft launch it inside of A&amp;I for a big discount just to get some feedback on the idea and execution.
  @aflorescpywrtr Fry it up. ü•ì
  @leanderhowardii Same. I go to the gym maybe 2-3x per week, but I love a good walk (plus I've had back surgery twice so walking is best)
  @Nevin1901 Yeah, I get that. My brain doesn't work quite that way, but at least you know.
  @isthisReda It was pretty exciting (and it made the walk much faster)
  @suryasays Where you living nowadays?
  @sachin-ramje Thanks man! Love your ability to execute on illustrations quickly and easily.
  @hypertrophydoc It‚Äôs as if i can think 10x more clearly. I love a good long walk with a smart partner.
  @eraldocavalli Sounds like the good doctor broke it down really well.
  @thealexbanks Yeah. I look forward to getting it done!
  @TheAlexBowen I walk every day. It‚Äôs the best exercise for thinking imo
  @Mahek-MD I love it. Appreciate that insight!
  @InfinityMastery Thank you! Me too.
  @Mahek-MD Same. My wife pulled this one out of me just by asking good questions.  My brain was free from distraction so I could effectively think through it.
  Brainstormed a new business idea during a 6-mile walk with my wife today.  - Domain purchased - MVP site in progress - Soft launch in a few weeks  Taking walks is a business cheat code.
  @sonnybyrd My take is to overdeliver at a great price (whatever you feel comfortable at) and then to grow your price over time as you build trust.
  @sonnybyrd Mine can run 2 hours, but I've taken amazing courses that are 45 minutes long.   The longer, the less likely people are to finish.   So, when you're starting, just get someone from point A to point B quickly and easily.
  @tanyamoushi I do video courses recorded on Loom and GDrive/Notion. Keep it pretty simple.
  @-DaveyRussell @ishverduzco I'm looking to buy in VT. Would love to learn more though.
  @ishverduzco Buy a BnB.
  @darentsmith Most people don't want to learn "everything". They want to learn how to get from point A to point B.
  @brie-e-anderson Don't think about it as selling.  Instead, teach people how to do something over the course of time. Share your expertise.  After doing that for some time, package your learnings up and offer it at a good price.
  @sachin-ramje Absolutely, my man.
  @seempaq Nice. Where can people find it?
  @UnleashTheKnow- Thank you. Not even a hack really...just a more simple process than people think.
  @BGroat Nice. Hypnosis sounds pretty serious.
  Digital course launch 101:  - Topic you could talk about unprepared - Presell via landing page first - Focused on one outcome - Timebox 14 to 30 days - Keep it short (45 min.) - Beta group + feedback - Ask for testimonials - Upsell coaching  Start one this weekend.
  @aaditsh Thanks so much for sharing my thread, Aadit. Massive appreciation.

  @justinmooretfam It‚Äôs both. (See tweet above)
  @justinmooretfam Per year originally. Moved to $99 per quarter to get some optionality.
  @reneefishman At the time (late 2018) I thought of Twitter as a place to get news and I had a few friends writing on LinkedIn.   It just sort of happened without a whole lot of thought behind the choice.   My community has a LI lean but it‚Äôs all about the

  @goodideasspread What would you feel comfortable paying for it?
  @kenwtong My wife and I are looking at investment properties. I'd buy that. If I would, so would a thousand other people.

  @WebWallen Get after it, Daniel. I'm sure there is plenty of good stuff there.
  @jaakkojar Semi-guilty.
  @trevorgodfrey- Yep, or just PDF it and make it $15 just to validate. Toss it on Gumroad. If people buy it, go deeper.
  @Brady-The-Flynn I found an old sales playbook I built. 80 pages. Could likely turn it into a template and sell it for a few hundred bucks and a few hundred times.
  @StevenTrister Even if something is worth just $10, that's just 100 customers over time.
  @sahilypatel Yeah. I'm 40, so I chose Google Drive. Probably should have said Notion. Haha.
  @SocialQui Things you know and have documented have value to people who don't know them.

  @sebastiaanluca @optimized3x Landing page + mailing list/social media following/relevant industry sites
  @optimized3x Presell before you build anything.
  @isthisReda There's a lot of harm in not testing.
  @ES738AN It‚Äôs better than being addicted to an idea that never takes off, ya know?
  Running a one-person business means knowing what not to work on.  Idea validation has never been faster &amp; easier.  - Domain (Google): $12/yr - Website (Carrd): $19/yr - Payment/delivery (Gumroad): Free  Always spend $31 before you go deep on something people don't want or need.
  @aakashg0 99% of people fall off over time.   Sometimes that strategy can simply be to outlast everyone.
  @Crypto16Dini Last man standing.
  Everyone is looking for a shortcut, so the short game is fierce.  Playing the long game is significantly less crowded.
  @dickiebush Great list, Dickie.  People spend so much time on content without spending nearly as much on the format.  Getting both right means more people reading and ingesting your knowledge.
  @florinpop1705 This is awesome. Love this idea!
  @MichelleCaira I had been actively building my audience for about 1 year. I feel like building out your audience is key to getting everything else right.
  @Oljaandjelkovic My favorite game is How Much Time Can I Spend With My Wife?
  @vijayswamidass I'm not a religious man, but I sure like that.
  @OmarMKhateeb 100%.   I've been trapped in this game before and it all starts with comparison. It's a mindmess.
  @jayd3sai @dingraps I think most people are aware but assume the barrier to entry is too high, when it's never been lower.
  @reneefishman No reason other than a few friends had built a following their and I saw an opportunity to use it like social media vs. how everyone else used it (resume, jobs, promotions, etc.)
  @reneefishman I actually wrote an article about loneliness when launching my community:  https://t.co/rVLSozERec
  @dingraps The only way to "have" something else is to create it (or be lucky enough to inherit it, which most of us aren't).  There has never been a better time to start creating your own luck.  If you love the game, then there's no issue to solve.
  @ChrisFranco I like that...
  @reneefishman Of course. If there is anything helpful I can share about how my wife and I work/support each other, feel free to ask.
  A lot of people I know sacrifice their lives to win an imaginary competition with their peers.  What's the point of winning a game you hate playing?
  @reneefishman 100% she's an enormous part of it.  When I say "one-person business" I meant to refer to the fact that I technically have no employees.  My wife and I support each other's businesses in many, many ways outside of just staying organized.
  @dickiebush Thanks, Dickie. What you're doing is certainly an inspiration to me. Appreciate the kind words, and look forward to sharing more.
  @Nicolascole77 I‚Äôd love to figure out how.   Want to see if we can put our heads together and make it happen?
  @Nicolascole77 Thanks, Nicolas. Appreciate it.   FYI, a lot of my community members are absolutely raving about Ship 30 for 30.   Say it‚Äôs the best program they‚Äôve been involved in. Congrats man.
  @dvassallo Started out with one business and then came across your content.  Diversification then became the goal.  Thanks for shedding a little light on my story with your audience, Daniel. Cheers.
  @marcusgrimm None of those things, specifically.  Just one course that I think tells my students how to get from point A to point B as quickly and easily as possible.  Focusing on anything else is just a waste of time.

  @Scribblerpoet Super kind, man.  Every single day I question whether I know anything.  Hearing nice things like this makes it easier to continue to share. Appreciate it.
  @Scribblerpoet It's not a bad idea.   Candidly, I don't really want to scale. I like small, not big.  Minimum responsibility while maintaining current revenue/income production.

  @lesroco That's an awesome compliment. Thanks, Les.   No selling, just sharing here.
  @trinefalbe I jumped into the deep end, but not because I thought I had it all figured out.  I burned out at my executive role and needed a break.  I was sort of forced into figuring it out.

  @darentsmith @dvassallo It happened to be around 20k followers on LinkedIn, but now that LinkedIn is more saturated, that's like 40k-50k followers today.  It's less about followers though, and more about the signals. If people are hitting your DMs regular

  I'm not sure what's next yet, but I'll be sharing as I figure it out.  If this was helpful, feel free to give me a follow.  If you have any questions, ask away.   Happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading.
  1. I still keep 2-3 consulting clients that I love on retainer.  2. I don't do any paid advertising of any kind.  3. I don't have any employees, but I do have a wife that helps me stay very organized.
  Finally, here's what my business revenue looks like after 2 years and 3 months:  Consulting: $880k Products:  $341k Community: $81k (collected)  (many thanks to people like @dvassallo for his portfolio of small bets strategy)  A few last notes of potential interest üëáüèª
  14/ Created optionality  I'm loving the community but realize, like anything, that love may not last forever.  Yearly subscriptions meant I'm on the hook for 12 months.  To create optionality, I moved to $99/quarters.  Now I'm always 90 days away from stopping.
  -Extra snippet:- @GeoffTRoberts  at @outseta wrote a really great article about building the community with automation to $40k+ in just 48 hours here:    https://t.co/EAvITZI64v
  13/ Built a community  As sales picked up, my interest in consulting faded.  I was doing $2k per day in info products and wanted to run with that.  I opened a private community for LinkedIn creators and charged $199.   Those who completed my course were prompted to join.
  13/ I began creating an army  At the halfway point of my course, people are encouraged to leave a testimonial and sign up for an affiliate program.  I built the same automation at the conclusion of the course.  I have 102 affiliates generating roughly $20 per month, per person.
  12/ Marketed aggressively  With 100% of my LinkedIn content focused on audience growth, and a product directly related to that content, sales took off.  My previous course grossed $75k in 15 months.  The second version has grossed $186k in 3 months.  Next up...
  11/ Tripled down  After the course was outdated, people started asking for a new version.  I rebuilt the course, but this time charged $150.  The earlier $50 price was my "trust tripwire".  I charged $50, delivered 100x worth the price, and built trust w/ a loyal customer base.
  10/ Ran with it  Over the next 15 months, I sold about $75k of the course.  I posted about audience building on LinkedIn and found other ways to continue to land consulting clients. (VCs, news sites, blogs, SaaStr, etc)  Even though it felt confusing, I continued to run with it.
  9/ Made my first product $$  I put the product for sale on Gumroad on April 16th, 2020.   In the first month, I made $10,482.   I was shocked.  I now had my first digital product, but it was in a totally different niche than my service business.  Honestly, this confused me.
  8/ Tested a hypothesis  I had organically grown to 20k+ followers on LinkedIn &amp; people wanted to know more.  I had a hypothesis that this would be an easy info product I could create &amp; sell.  I put together a short course for $50 (more on price later) &amp; wrote posts about it.
  7/ Kept my eyes and ears open  Something really interesting happened.  In an attempt to find common problems to productize, I started rereading my LinkedIn DMs.  I had some repetitive questions about SaaS sales, but I also had an inbox jammed with questions about LinkedIn.
  6/ Reduced my time  With new rates, I could have worked the same and made 2x as much.   Instead, I chose to work 50% of the time and make the same.  I used that extra time to figure out how to scale automated income.  My goal has always been to get my time back.
  5/ 2x'ed my rates  With a well-defined niche, some happy customers, and testimonials, I 2x'ed my rates.  I started creating more content that was even more targeted. This led to more conversations with ideal-fit prospects.  I said no to any company outside of my niche.
  4/ Found my ideal customers  Inside of your customer base is more signals.  What are the commonalities between the customers you love and those who love you?  Mine were early-stage SMB SaaS companies in the healthcare space. A space I was experienced in.  That became my niche.
  3/ Built a service business  My experience building SaaS sales teams was resonating. So I began creating more and more content about that.  Founders sent me DMs asking questions.   I responded to every single one.  Once I had prospects in my funnel, I started consulting.
  2/ Honed in on signals  Inside of all of that noise were some signals.  Sometimes I bombed, sometimes I struck a chord.  The more I looked at what resonated, the more I doubled down.   This allowed me to understand what people cared about.
  Last week my little one-person business crossed $1.3M in revenue.  It took 810 days, I ran zero paid ads and operate at a ~98% margin.  Here are the 14 steps of my strange journey:  Hope it's helpful to someone.  [üßµ thread]
  @SullyBusiness You're no dummy, my man.  People are so busy saying shitty things about it, that they don't realize the potential.  It's massive.
  @JLBellefeuille That's a helluva driving force. I love it.
  @Synnovatia Yep. Feels like profitability could be an outcome of better/faster.
  @CalebBillesbach Thank you, Caleb.
  Every time you have an infuriating customer experience, write it down.  A list of problems = a list of opportunities  Then solve one problem:  - Better - Faster - Cheaper  Ideas are packed inside of frustration.

  @aaraalto Your products are super meaningful. My wife is jazzed about the newest one. Looking fwd to it.
  @mar15sa This is an awesome thread. Thank you for sharing!
  @mar15sa Love that idea of "personally optimized". I'm still attempting to move toward that more frequently.
  @DavidVanMtl That's a great share.  Learning, tinkering, building...all things I loved doing at early-stage startups.  The ability to do those things with a bit of flexibility and freedom throw-in has made solopreneurship a lot of fun.
  @mistamor That's what drives me.
  @uluhonolulu I love to work. I feel lost without something to drive towards.   I just want it to be my thing.
  @StackOnTheLow Ha. Same.
  My goal as an entrepreneur was never to work less.   It‚Äôs always been freedom, flexibility, and meaning.  What‚Äôs yours?
  @SullyBusiness @JayMaxweII Love it.   Keep it going. An underrated place to grow.
  @SullyBusiness @JayMaxweII Looking fwd to hearing your thoughts üôåüèª
  @shl I have no doubt.  Will share my thoughts as soon as I‚Äôm done.   Appreciate you writing it.
  P.S. I've also been a long-time @gumroad user.  I signed up on March 13th, 2020 and because it was so easy, I made my first dollar online that day.  17 months later, I'm over $323k in sales.  Here's hoping this book unlocks a little more.   I'll keep you posted.
  I bought it because he talks about entrepreneurship in a way that resonates with me  - I don't want to raise $100M - I don't want to build a unicorn  I just want to help people and continue to diversify my portfolio of small, profitable, one-person businesses.
  Confession: I don't read a lot of books.  Especially books on business &amp; entrepreneurship.  I find most of them to be 200+ pages of recycled blog posts and fluff.  I just received The Minimalist Entrepreneur by @shl   I haven't been this excited for a book in a while.  https://t.co/tnVYnVzlXW

  @awilkinson This is one of the best threads I‚Äôve read in awhile. Kudos to you.

  @SocialQui I‚Äôm not advocating you learn everything from books.   Go learn by doing.
  @sonnybyrd Mine is Google and Twitter and trying.
  @blcooley And if you do, you‚Äôre doing yourself a massive disservice.   Learn to problem solve. Get far. Then ask.
  @blcooley Everyone is a mentor. They are helpful but only to the extent the mentee is willing to try first.   When the mentee gets stuck the mentor helps.   But don‚Äôt ask for help if you haven‚Äôt even tried.
  @pheadrick If you can‚Äôt teach yourself, you‚Äôll always be a liability to someone.
  The most important skill to learn is how to learn on your own.  Mentors are great, but overrated.  Mentors work well when you've reached a ceiling of teaching yourself everything you could possibly know about a subject.  Learn to learn and you've built a life-changing muscle.
  @SeanAnthonySays You were a star. The feedback has been phenomenal. I learned so much myself, Sean.   Your valuable time is much appreciated.

  @harleyf Agreed. You can build a 6 or 7-figure business (or a diversified portfolio of businesses) in your sweats. Wild.

  @darentsmith Limited downside and enormous upside.
  @justincardillo Amazing, congrats! Keep me posted on wins and struggles. Always happy to share what I‚Äôve learned.
  If you‚Äôre a successful operator you likely have the skills to be an entrepreneur.   So much of building on your own is listening, testing, fixing, and testing again.   Stuff you already do.   Has there ever been a better time to try?
  @ChrisRocas Awesome. I've read Deep Work. Will check out Lean Analytics. Appreciate it!
  @ChrisRocas Very cool. Any particular favorite reads?

  @sonnybyrd I‚Äôm potentially a major letdown.
  @Kim-Currier- My fave! Coming back in 6 weeks and it‚Äôs the first place I grabbed a res at.
  @darentsmith @dvassallo In my experience this was true. Build one to stabilize and then expand. I‚Äôm sure there are others who did it differently, but that was ky path.
  @mistamor Definitely. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm suggesting.
  @dvassallo @darentsmith Looking fwd to it.
  @kharp04 Agree. People ask me and I don‚Äôt really know what to say.
  @mistamor Sure. Instead of building one large business that increases risk (i.e. consultant) build several streams.   - Consultant - Advisor - Coaching - Info product  - Community - SaaS product  Etc.   Lower income per but less risk.
  @darentsmith @dvassallo He‚Äôs the person who turned me onto thinking this way.   I was going deep into one business and then expanded to 5. Built each of those to nice revenue milestones and just keep adding.   Joined his upcoming cohort based coaching pro
  @AliQOfficial @morganhousel The last part is often the hardest. I get pretty wrapped up in ‚Äúkeeping up with the Joneses‚Äù and need to remind myself how important it is to do things I love. Not what other people love.
  Your self-employed income goals are more likely to be achieved with a portfolio strategy.  Think 4-5 smaller income streams.  Provides much greater flexibility and reduced risk when compared to one big bet.
  @LindsayTrombley Of course, that's fine.   As long as nobody else is telling them they weren't cut out to be entrepreneurs.

  @businessbarista Cohort.
  @kharp04 Good on ya for doing it. Ignore the doubters and just flourish instead.
  @theyouthfulguy Yeah I feel like it comes off as a weird self-serving statement.   Almost reminding the person saying it that they are special.
  @GradyTeske Ha. Feel you here. I can't stop. Just layering on more and more.
  @GradyTeske Agreed.
  @GradyTeske Yeah definitely. Both very hard.  But this idea that "not everyone is meant for it" has always struck me as strange.  What people are really saying is "I don't think most people have it".
  @GradyTeske Entrepreneurship is not "leaping".  You can easily be an entrepreneur without doing so.   Go build a $500/month side hustle. You're an entrepreneur. No leap required.
  @Alec-Coughlin Or just starting anything.   We've pigeon-holed the term entrepreneur, but I think so many people would benefit from just starting something they own. Anything.
  "Entrepreneurship isn't for everyone".  Are we sure?  Maybe starting a venture-backed SaaS company isn't for everyone, but entrepreneurship?   Seems like something everyone should participate in.
  @adammarx13 Yep. Everything easy to you is difficult to someone.  It's all about finding out who those "someone" are.
  Remember that everything you think is obvious is worth money to someone else.  Have a great Sunday.
  @jmckinven Same. Went for a 2-hour walk. Came back to $750 in product sales.  My mind is blown every single day.
  @AltumCode Yep. I'm at almost 2.5 years. It's been an incredible experience.   Can be wildly unpredictable but that forces me to be adaptable as hell. I love that.
  @dagorenouf @Imene-Maharzi I hear that guy is full of shit.   Could be a rumor though.
  @EricJorgenson This resonates for sure.   I think the main difference is that being employed hardly ever deviates. It's likely 40+ hours forever.   I've been able to gradually decrease my hours each quarter working for myself.   Hope the trend continues.
  @StevenTrister That's awesome. Bonding over business. Love it.
  @pheadrick Just enjoying the ride as long as I can stay on it! Thank you my man.

  @StevenTrister Simple procrastination.  Feeling like I was moving the ball just by thinking about it.

  @morganjingram What Discords are you hanging in?
  @emotf I find that learning is often procrastination when depending on others to teach.  Those who are proactive in teaching themselves are generally biased toward action.  So, execution comes around.
  The smartest entrepreneurs I know aren't always "smart".  But they are always autonomous.  Learning how to teach yourself is underrated, underappreciated, and often overlooked.
  @sweatystartup @mattragland This you? Or someone you know?
  @jkhasson An internet connection and a willingness to put yourself out there...that's it.
  @darentsmith To me, it's amazing how little friction there is to taking part in some of the best conversations in the world.  Wild.
  @SaasDemosKing Hell yeah.
  @gregsroche Creating luck requires a simple internet connection. That's just wild.
  Each morning, I wake up with this realization:  Creating your own luck has never been easier than it is right now.  The upside is infinite while the downside is almost non-existent.  It feels foolish not to embrace this opportunity.

  @jasonmpearl Same. I just grabbed a beer with a guy a few weeks ago and formed an acquaintanceship. A few days ago I needed his help so I just paid him. Everyone‚Äôs busy.
  @BrianSexton13 If I accept free calls with every stranger who asks instead of spending time with my wife, then I‚Äôve got my priorities backward as a family man.
  @levani-tev How so?
  @edward-gorbis That's probably the right answer.
  @jasonvana I've reached out to 2 people I don't know this week with asks.   I've offered to pay both and gladly did.
  Whenever you ask a stranger for their time, you should proactively offer to pay them for it.  Let it be their decision to give it to you for free.  Why doesn't everyone understand this?

  @AlfieIsaMarsh @digitalpratik @AliAbdaal @petermckinnon Ahh..appreciate you, Alfie!
  @healthonpeak The easiest way to do something well is to start by doing it poorly.
  The more you try, the more you fail.  The more you fail, the more you learn.  The more you learn, the better you get.   As usual, it all starts with trying.
  @StephEgger A lot. It's definitely dependent on building a large following.  But that's why I advocate people invest in doing so.
  @ybhrdwj I almost never add anyone. I have 110k followers but only about 15k connections, 75% of which have come from them connecting to me.
  @ybhrdwj I've been growing it over time for about 31 months now.

  @col-fink Sure but I know people making 6-figures selling courses on how to make balloon animals.   Also, Twitter is jammed full of people selling ‚ÄúHow to Twitter‚Äù  The platforms aren‚Äôt too dissimilar in that regard.
  @hnabimedia Appreciate it!
  @BenjaminPutano True :)
  In case you're wondering...  Of the $60k in sales:  - $45k came from LinkedIn - $14k came from my email list - $1k came from random other places  It's a powerful platform if you use it right.  If you wanna use it how I use it. üëáüèª  https://t.co/53lVT9nCxa
  LinkedIn is underrated.  Here's what I've done so far in July:  - Built a course page - Wrote 1 post on LinkedIn - Wrote 1 email to my email list - Drove 2.8k+ to the landing page - Converted ~19.5% into customers - Sold $60,322 worth of the new course  Creators are missing out.  https://t.co/5dNXzmLxU8
  @BGroat @randfish This is an incredibly interesting perspective.
  @mistamor If that‚Äôs true, why do you think everyone parrots ‚ÄúBe authentic!‚Äù ?
  @jspector I like that.   (Warning: I‚Äôm wrong a lot)  üòÇ
  @jspector I agree. I‚Äôve been using ‚Äúincome‚Äù a lot.
  @9Flare Right. That would be fine.   But the bigger point here is that most marketing is inauthentic.   Sexy people on the beach don‚Äôt drink Coke.  Runners don‚Äôt drink Michelob ultra.  Most dinners at Olive Garden aren‚Äôt 10 multi-cultural people.
  @jspector I only mention it because I struggle with the exact same two words.
  @jspector I like it but don‚Äôt love the slash between audience and business.   Comes across as non-committal. One word is probably better than the other.
  @SeanAnthonySays My gameplan is just die last.
  @BenjaminPutano Depends on what you mean by underrated but I‚Äôve always felt NYC &gt; SF
  @9Flare ‚Äú2020 was a tough year for all of us‚Ä¶so here at Dyson Vacuums, we‚Äôre ready to start 2021 clean‚Ä¶with a sale!‚Äù
  @MoniqueVilla ‚ÄúHow do we manufacture authenticity??‚Äù   - Every CMO
  @BGroat Exactly.   Coca-cola isn‚Äôt the drink of choice for gorgeous people on a beach, but you wouldn‚Äôt know that from their marketing.   Buzzwords are getting to be too much for me.
  If "be authentic" is such good marketing advice, then why is every commercial completely inauthentic?
  @OneJKMolina I vacillate between thinking I‚Äôm the greatest and thinking I‚Äôm terrible every single day.   Seems normal.
  @Bluegirlpdx @corprteUnicorn They don‚Äôt. They usually disagree.   But when they do, then we work together.
  @corprteUnicorn This is why I require payment upfront.
  @brendanjshort At my favorite bar in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, the bartender gave me a free beer each time I came in.  I moved to LA and didn't get a free beer for 4.5 years.
  @SandeshChahar4 Yep. Good point.
  @jessievbreugel Probably @dvassallo   I appreciate the way he thinks about living.
  @brandondigital Definitely. I went to college and loved it.

  Well, that's all I've got today.   I hope these tips help you write better content.  If you liked this, feel free to give me a follow.  Or check out my long-form content at  https://t.co/vCOnWlCOTz  I write often about solopreneurship, writing, and creating.  Cheers.
  10/ Don't break lines in the middle. Write better lines.  Lines don't  Naturally break  Like this  Learn to shorten your sentences &amp; deliver value fast.   Gimmicks and hacks make you look "gimmicky" and "hacky".
  9/ Good content + bad hook = little readership  You can write the best content in the world, but if you can't get people to stop and read it?  You don't get reap the rewards.  The best way to write good hooks?  Study other great hook writers.
  8/ Write for a small niche in the beginning  People like to say things like, "I write for founders."  Founders? Which ones?   Tech? Agency? Seed round? Series A? B? Pre-revenue? $100M+? B2C? B2B?  Start small, expand later.  "No niche is too small if it's yours" - Seth Godin.
  6/ Create a lot of noise, look for signal  Publish early, publish often, and look for what resonates.  Be careful though.  Engagement can be misleading. Look for:  - Comments that indicate a full read - Repeat commenters - Purchases from content
  5/ Cut 30% to 40% of what you write  There isn't a reward for most words written.  The reward comes when people finish your content and take the intended action.  Try and make a point in as few words as possible.  Need more words to go deep? Go long-form.
  4/ Choose pronouns  Don't write "at" people.   Write "to" them.  Use words like "you" and "yours" rather than calling people "salespeople" or "marketers".  Make it personal.
  2/ Use simple words  Nobody wants to grab a thesaurus when reading short-form.  Plus, the more easily you can explain something, the better you understand it.  Stop trying to impress. Start making an impact.
  1/ Write for mobile  Make sure your content is "chunky".  Use shorter sentences, add some white space, and make it easy to skim.  Tip? Write ON mobile.
  I've done 46M+ impressions on my written content in 2 years.  Here are 10 valuable writing lessons...  [üßµTHREAD]

  @edward-gorbis @JaviEug As much as I love CDMX I‚Äôm still new the saas scene down there.
  @dtoddhart Yep. I‚Äôve found it to be the opposite actually.
  @Zhero-World But so often we decide for ourselves that what we have isn‚Äôt valuable.   Such a wasted opportunity.
  @kevinbooyens What comes easiest to us is often the thing you can charge the most for.   We just assume everyone knows already...  A missed opp for sure.
  Everything obvious to you is worth money to someone else.  Have a great morning.
  @SeanAnthonySays 100%.   What‚Äôs next, and what is easiest/most automated?
  @SeanAnthonySays Unlocking the potential of these numbers (per our conversation the other day).   I think a lot of folks understand how to acquire subscribers, but not necessarily what to do next.

  20/ Nearly everyone is winging it.  Are some people light-years ahead when it comes to their thing? Of course. Elon, Steve Jobs, etc.  But most people who you admire are still figuring it out.  Every day, just plugging along. As nervous as you are.  Find comfort in that.
  19/ Consistency trumps all traits.  There are lots of skills you can learn.  But as a pure trait?  Consistency is tough to beat.  Athlete, businessperson, creator, etc.  Do your thing every single day and reap the rewards downstream.
  18/ You can't say yes to everyone.  I've learned that saying yes to everyone means saying no to yourself and the people you care the most about.  A 15-minute brain pick with a stranger or 15-minutes more with your spouse?  It should be that easy of a choice.
  17/ Money is not the root of all evil.  Money is simply the key to unlocking whomever you are as a person.  Get your hands on some money so you can be the best version of yourself.   Help other good people get theirs too.  Bad people with money are what's evil.
  16/ Time is the single greatest asset.  It's a cliche for a reason.  Of all of the things I wish for, having more time is number one by a long shot.  My 20s moved fast, my 30s moved so much faster.  I wish I would have appreciated time at a much younger age.
  15/ Divorce from anyone who drains you.  As I mentioned before, your environment is critical to success.  People either add to your energy or subtract from it.  You'll spend 10x more time dealing with the subtractors.  Cut early.
  13/ Don't spend time with people who don't reciprocate.  My therapist put it best when she told me this:  "Reciprocity is an indicator that someone is invested in the relationship."  Thanks, Erin.
  12/ If you can't teach yourself, you'll always be a liability.  If people have to spend their time teaching you simple things that you can learn on the internet, you'll always be considered a liability.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living.  Autonomy is a differentiator.
  11/ 10% of people will hate what you do no matter what.  I've seen it in every industry and with every creator.  There is a group of people that will always dislike you and your mission. No matter what.  Focus on the 90%. Not the 10%.
  10/ There is absolutely nothing wrong with being selfish.  Can you be selfish to a fault? Probably.  If you always put the needs of others over yours (and your families), life will be more difficult.  Give and take.  Or get taken advantage of.
  9/ Everyone has knowledge that other people will pay for  The idea that you have to be an "expert" or have a certificate to teach or sell something is a fallacy.  Expertise is linear.   You can make a living helping those earlier in the journey than you.
  8/ Getting 1% better at something means leaping millions.  1% of the total internet-connected population is 46M people.  Continue to get 1% better each month, quarter, year, and you're making significant strides in the overall ecosystem.
  6/ The most important skill to learn is how to learn on your own.  Mentors are great, but they are overrated.  Mentors work well when you've reached a ceiling of teaching yourself everything you could possibly know about a subject.  Learn to learn and you're unstoppable.
  5/ It's difficult to build a work ethic without the right environment.  Everyone talks about "hard work" and "outworking the competition".  It's tough to forcefully create this behavior.  Curate your environment and the behavior is a more likely outcome.
  4/ Comparing yourself to others is the easiest way to get distracted.  You can only control how successful you are, not how successful someone else is.  Be the best version of yourself, not a better version of someone else.
  3/ 100% of people are out for themselves, even if it doesn't appear so.  Most people might find this pessimistic, but I just find it realistic.  Curious about someone's motivation? Look at how they are incentivized.
  1/ The 2nd biggest difference between success &amp; failure is persistence.  Successful friends and peers of mine have almost always been doing their "thing" for decades.   Not just years.  Most people give up in the "I suck at this" phase without considering the long game.
  Today I turn 40.   Here are 20 helpful lessons I've learned during my life.  [üßµTHREAD]

  @jasonmpearl Kind words, my friend. Thank you.   (Although this thread is likely my ‚Äúboastiest‚Äù)

  If you enjoyed this thread, you should:   1. Follow me, I tweet about solopreneurship and leveraging LinkedIn.  2. Grab my new product, The LinkedIn Operating System if you want to join me.  Coming August 4th.   https://t.co/cEWxLIoROT
  10/ My thoughts...  Twitter folks dump on LinkedIn all day.  You're almost guaranteed engagement if you do.  But you should consider the alternative.  Hang at the cool kid's table or look for the opportunity?  I'll be over here moving toward $30k.  (Obligatory @Gumroad Shot)  https://t.co/Fuktj0vobR
  9/ Collect social proof in real-time  People said incredibly nice things on my LinkedIn post today.  So, I took those compliments and started adding them to my website in real-time.  The conversion started increasing dramatically, almost immediately.  This was huge.  https://t.co/BseKrVaJMM
  8/ Then hit your email list  I followed up with an 8:15a email to 6,900 people.  So far, have a 45% open rate, which is one of my best.  I use Ghost to deliver it cleanly to their inbox and wrote some "curtain copy" to entice.  $5,500 through email.  https://t.co/C8op8obIDT
  7/ Engage like hell  I spent 6 hours engaging with nearly every comment that came my way.  I answered every DM.  I answered every email.  All of this upfront effort will pay off downstream.  https://t.co/XSGGAgQByi
  6/ Prepare your one ask  First, I published a LinkedIn post at 7:15a to my 102k followers promoting my new course.  30 seconds later, I asked my private Discord community (of LinkedIn followers) to support it.  I maybe make this ask ONCE a year.  https://t.co/mTdoFQqtXU
  5/ Use the profile effectively  The "featured section" part of your LinkedIn profile is prime real estate to feature CTAs.   For today's launch, I primed it to reflect the product I released.  Then I drove people to my website with the next step...  https://t.co/R9plFxrnDI
  4/ Be consistent + patient  I've posted every weekday for about 30 months.  I've been consistent with my niche, and patient while I grew.  Having 102k potential customers is extremely powerful.  When I make an ask?   üí∞
  3/ Be bold  Everyone is bold on Twitter because that's the culture.  LinkedIn is buttoned up.  But it doesn't have to be...  I stick out like a sore thumb because everyone else is worried about their boss.  Come say something mildly polarizing &amp; watch what happens.
  2/ Pick a sub-niche  I know it's hip and ironic to say that a niche doesn't matter, but every person saying that has no following.  Go deep on one subject.  Just like Twitter, be the:  "Writing guy" "Crypto guy" "SEO girl"  Same as Twitter. Works there. Works on LinkedIn.
  1/ Treat LinkedIn like Twitter  LinkedIn has notoriously hacky content. So what?  That's YOUR advantage.  Instead of sharing boring job posts or resumes, come drop knowledge and teach.   Opportunity is literally everywhere.
  Twitter: LinkedIn sucks!  Me: $20k product launch in 9 hours.  All LinkedIn. Zero ads.  Here's how I use LinkedIn unlike anyone else.  [üßµTHREAD]

  @davegetssocial That's cool. I spend a lot of my time helping people, so the word "grift" stung a bit.   It's the opposite of what I stand for.  I do believe lots of people buy "stuff" because that's just our culture...but that's just my thoughts. Doesn't
  @Dmurr68 I put up an away message and redirect them to my email...which has a vacation message up permanently.
  @davegetssocial @FindTroy It's weird to call a suggestion that people build something of their own a "grift" when you run a marketing service for small business owners...
  @FindTroy @InspiredByWayne I‚Äôve done both in my life.   #2 has certainly been more rewarding.
  @jmcmillen89 FWIW, I like Discord. They desperately need threads, but Slack is just too "worky" for me. I want this to be fun.
  @BGroat @jmcmillen89 That's how I felt about it.  My audience is on LinkedIn, and that's basically async chat already. I post something. They comment. I comment back later.  Part of the whole value prop is conversation.

  Well...that's all so far folks.  If you enjoyed this thread, you should:   1. Follow me. I tweet once or twice a week about my solopreneur journey.  2. Subscribe to my free newsletter where I break down audience and income growth tactics.   https://t.co/64c9cl975Z
  7// You must market hard  I don't just mean to get people onto your waitlist, or interested. I mean marketing to people who have already expressed interest.  People are busy. They forget to apply. They forget to pay.  72-hour, 24-hour, and 2-hour reminders work wonders.
  6// The community software space needs help  If you want synchronous conversation, you're left hacking together a bunch of tools.   - Member directory - Resource center - Events - Real-time conversation  IMO, there is not a single company doing all of this extremely well.
  5// It's super rewarding  We already have dozens of member wins, stories of new business being closed, and people seeing dramatic growth in their social media audience.  It feels amazing to be helping people that put their trust in me.
  4// It's time-consuming.  I spend about 10 hours per day working in the community, which is a lot given the current MRR.  The upside is that more members don't necessarily equal more work. As this scales, I believe internal community management will provide me with more time.
  3// Synchronous conversation is intense.  We chose Discord because I had a hypothesis that synchronous conversation would be important.  It seems to be proving out true so far, but there are certainly complaints about it being overwhelming.   I wish I had done more research.
  2// Early culture is key  We put people through a robust application process to deeply understand who they are.  We set expectations 3x on who should join and who shouldn't. We emphasized the importance of creativity, participation, etc.  Our first 2 cohorts are amazing.
  1// Outcomes matter  It's critical that everyone is focused on the same outcome.   I have ~100k followers on LinkedIn, so some people applied just to hang out.  Those members tend not to engage because the daily outcomes we're working towards aren't why they joined. Be thorough.
  My private community passed $4k MRR in less than 4 weeks.  230+ members chatting in real-time on Discord.  Some things went well.  Others? Not as much.  Here are 7 takeaways from my first month as a community builder. //threadüßµ//  https://t.co/Q1J7Nlt2gp

  @mcilmarketing Ha. I need to @ everyone (myself included)
  Anything worth accomplishing doesn't have a step-by-step guide on the internet.

  @itsKostasOnFIRE It doesn't have to be one year, that just worked really well for me. I think people want to rush it.
  @SACHIN-RAMJE I don't think you should shorten it...I think it's worthwhile to put in the time, IMO.  I like to launch an asset once a lot of people have asked me the same question over and over.  Then, I presell.
  @mikaelfyi I built products/assets that were way too long and I let technology be a bottleneck, instead of keeping it simple.  Re: false, I realized you don't have to be an "expert" to make a sale. Just further along on your journey.
  Building a small income stream is simple, but not easy.  My best advice?  Don't overcomplicate it.  - Create valuable content for a year. - Listen to what questions people ask. - Solve their question with a digital asset. - If they need more, offer a short call.  Keep it simple.

  @luqmaansa @SeanAnthonySays Depends. If people believe it takes 7 hours to solve a particular problem then maybe. I've found that people enjoy brevity, especially if it helps them solve a challenge in 30 minutes or less.  Outcomes vs. time
  @BGroat @SeanAnthonySays Thank you! üôå
  @BGroat @SeanAnthonySays $30 to $50. I think more about outcome achieved than length of course.
  @SeanAnthonySays I know this to be true. My first course was 75-minutes long and has a 60% completion rate. My second was 3.5 hours and has a 40% completion rate. Need to get closer to 30-45.
  @5harath Thanks, my man!
  @mattlady Be calm. Be slow.   Realize the audience is filled with people who want to hear what you have to say.   It‚Äôs not an audition. It‚Äôs a support group.   Be real. Don‚Äôt know something? Say you‚Äôll figure it out and get back to them.
  @TheCoolestCool Even becoming acquaintances will work to start. Just show up and give a bit.   Add to the conversation. Connect. Help.   Friendship takes time.   Transactional is what you do when you don‚Äôt understand the long game is even possible.

  @brendanjshort To me, approaching a scenario without any interest in how the other side feels or why they feel that way is so strange.   I‚Äôm usually naturally curious as to how 2 people could be so far apart on one topic.
  @Hunckler @ArlanWasHere @SteveCase @randfish @CandiceBrackeen @brianclark @maryGrove How the heck did I crash this party of giants?

  @DrewbixMusic @landforce Definitely. I usually had ‚Äúfail fast‚Äù metrics installed.
  @scholz-felix Take a lot of people a long time. I wasn't always the optimist.  Became one when I realized most problems can be solved with some creativity + optimism.
  @tibo-maker I like being the person that says, "how can we?" in a room of "Here's why this won't work..."
  @BenjaminPutano I'm generally the optimist and have been through plenty of moments of being "wrong". It can be embarrassing.  In the end, when you get it right? 10x the feeling in the opposite direction.
  @EhabJames I've been surrounded by pessimists in a situation that requires optimism. It's brutal.
  Optimism is a business superpower.   Optimists solve problems before pessimists finish talking about why it can‚Äôt be done.

  @valsopi I feel like it very much could be.  Like my brain was just locked for 72 then opened up on the car ride home.  Was the retreat a success? Debatable.
  @JWellsCFO Yeah, that's better. Ha.
  @studioofchange It was not tremendous, tbh. But, that's ok. Next time!
  @JWellsCFO Maybe vacation wasn't the right word, but it was a trip specifically meant to focus on my business.
  @studioofchange That's what I learned, the hard way, this past weekend. I guess you simply can't force the creativity...
  It's hard to plan "deep work."  I went on vacation this weekend specifically to focus on my business.  For the entire 72 hours, I struggled.  On the ride home, feeling dejected, I had an epiphany that I'm now working on back at home.  The lesson? When the moment hits, grab it.

  @coding-2A-Ron Not just the ask, but the disappointment when you say, "Ok - here's what I charge."  Believe me, plenty of people on Twitter have shamed me for thinking I should charge people for my time.  People are wacky.
  @drgurner That's a fair point. Would have to give it some deeper thought to make it a win/win.   Again, this isn't some idea to "get rich". I want to help people succeed and de-risk the investment on my side while being able to make some profit.
  @drgurner Candidly, I'm not sure, Dr. Garner. Sort of a half-baked idea at the moment.  My goal wouldn't be to get rich here but to make a similar return to any other investment while simultaneously helping someone create a great life and business.

  @darentsmith I haven't actually looked into it. I don't even understand what the options are at the moment. Just started contemplating it with all of the unique new fundraising going on.
  @AlexLlullTW I feel like even a 5k or 10k investment with a rev share agreement could be a win/win, ya know?
  @smacmannis @AlexMasmej Thank you so much. Going to dive in. Much appreciated.
  @bensterne @weekendclubHQ Gonna check this out. I‚Äôm not really a bootstrapper in the traditional sense, but would love to follow some folks who are.
  @victorluna @DannPetty When you say invested, mind sharing a bit more?
  @smacmannis @AlexMasmej I actually haven‚Äôt heard of this. I‚Äôd love to read up on it though.   I think it‚Äôs simply how to get started, maybe?
  @MamdouhMoemin @LiamMews Just gave him a follow to see what he‚Äôs all about. Thanks!
  @EytanMessika @Julian This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much for sharing this.
  @schleinzer-com Anyone outside of you?
  @techfounderxoxo Anyone outside of yourself?
  @jmoserr @mkhundmiri Just started following him the other day. Love it, Jeremy.
  @NickB2005 @ChrisWalker171 Thanks man. Had a blast. I‚Äôll take that investment üòâ
  All I want to do is invest in people.   Not companies. Just individual people.   I've come across so many unique creators.   I think a small check + some guidance would be all they need to get rolling.  If you could invest in one creator, who would it be?
  @aaditsh @heyblake @brandonthezhang @dickiebush @heydannymiranda I retweet when something stands on its own and I quote tweet when I need to add some context.   Pretty simple for me.
  @airSlate  https://t.co/TjMkwtYXOV
  @johnfitch- 100% on that. I'm considering taking a month off :)
  @thescottleese Haha. Living through a bored life doesn‚Äôt exactly get me all jacked up.
  @Ali-Merchant Damn that‚Äôs a smart quote from Dad. I love it. üî•
  @JuriaanKarsten Same here. I appreciate consistency more than almost anything. üî•
  @JonathanAGraham A race worth running!
  @hrishio One of the toughest to learn.   Goes against everything that we feel in the age of ‚Äúgive it to me now‚Äù.
  Success is an endurance race.  - Everyone can start something. - Most people can go hard for a few weeks. - Some people can stay consistent for a few months.  The long game?   Very uncrowded.
  @GerardDawson3 Position your business as outcomes not hours. That‚Äôs what I do on every discovery call with a prospect. Come armed with examples.
  @MattHogan123 I mean create a life where you don't always have to be scaling your business up to survive.   Create a life where instead, you can do less work and make enough to live comfortably.
  @LynGraft Lots of time talk. I like it.
  Remember:  How you value your time is how others will value it.
  @studioofchange Definitely. I can't tell you how many conversations I've had with people who had nearly an identical upbringing and career who tell me, "it doesn't work that way for me".

  @ericjmlee It's the X factor in pressing "go".
  @EhabJames I've found it nearly impossible to convince otherwise, someone who has already convinced themselves.
  Every successful person I know believes in themself.  Every unsuccessful person I know believes the game is rigged against them.  It's clich√© as hell, but mindset is everything.

  @OzolinsJanis This is fantastic. Great job, Janis. Looking fwd to more üî•üî•
  @JWellsCFO Sure, I just mean that income is meaningless without the context of spending. It's why so many athletes are broke as hell.
  @realBrookNash If people think they are going to naturally change their spending habits when they make more, they are fooling themselves.
  @RosserJobs Definitely. But it‚Äôs tough to out-earn shitty spending habits.
  Brag less about income and more about expense reduction.
  @jonathanenlared @testimonialto Signed up recently and have a reminder to dive in. Thanks!
  @lexpaval I guess I use Google Docs so maybe I should just keep my mouth shut üòÇ
  @aaditsh I‚Äôm not even sure they take you from 80 to 90.   I feel like it‚Äôs an illusion of productivity. Doing a bunch of stuff in a Notion template feels great.   Building something with that time feels better. Just my opinion though.
  @EhabJames The idea that they are somehow a necessary part of a creators stack is weird. If you need a tool to be productive you might not actually enjoy what you‚Äôre creating.
  You don't need productivity tools to be productive.  Just start.
  @darentsmith Awesome. Drop me a note when it's out üôå

  @mattragland About a year ago, I had a beer with a VC in LA who told me, "Want to go viral on Twitter?"  "Share your productivity hacks or your morning routines."  It's not actually about being helpful. It's simply about engagement.
  @KeevinOrourke At the moment, my wife. I plan on adding some folks to my team later this year as I dive deeper into content creation.

  @tomosman Gonna check this out later today. Appreciate you sharing, Tom.
  @tomosman As free software allows similar interaction to big names (Clubhouse, Spaces) it's going to be harder to make a community actually stand out. It's going to require direct 1:1 or 1:few interaction that justifies a cost.  Still, I don't have the an

  Many communities don't actually feel like communities.  More like being a ticket holder at an event with a popular speaker &amp; limited member interaction.  Quick speech. Photo afterward.  Very impersonal.  At peak saturation, addressing this will be critical in retention, IMO.

  @YanceySanderson It's from the book "Hell Yeah or No" by @sivers. I bought it a few months back and finally opened it today. I've been enjoying it all morning. Exceptional read.
  @BGroat It's an interesting way to think. I often tell my story of being a tech executive. But, I haven't been one in almost 2 years. I'm OK with that. Making it the past allows me to be someone different in my future (and my present).

  @dvassallo @AnkitP-tweets It's a great question, but I don't feel the need to make a product thousands of dollars to insinuate quality. Mostly because I've purchased so many high-quality/low-cost courses already.

  @MishaCreatrix Awesome. Try this next time and keep going for it, Michelle.
  @chrisdcloud Presell it on a simple landing page. If nobody buys, not worth building. The 45-minute course can be simple modules:  5 X 9 min. 6 X 8 min. 9 X 5 min.  Whatever works for you to get students to that one outcome.
  Launching your 1st digital course 101:  - Topic you could talk about unprepared - Presell via landing page first - Focused on one outcome - Timebox 14 to 30 days - Keep it short (~45 min.) - Beta group + feedback - Ask for testimonials - Upsell coaching  Start one this weekend.
  Being broke doesn't make you "indie". Being wealthy doesn't make you a "sellout".  These are labels people apply to feel better.  Work to put yourself in the best situation for you, not to earn the best label from others.

  @vantellus It's amazing how many people get power from doubt. From the assuredness that what you're looking to do simply cannot work.
  In business, be wary of people who say:  "That will never work...", but are unwilling to try.  ‚úÖ Doubt is fine. ‚úÖ Debate is fine. ‚úÖ Concern is fine.  Being unwilling to hypothesize, test and iterate is not.

  Observation:  Most people who can't handle being challenged are the same people who don't believe in themselves.  Thin skin is a confidence issue.

  @TheCoolestCool Consistency + value + community + patience (and plenty of other things)...  Are there learnings that you can help folks realize sooner? Sure.  But you simply cannot "hack" a long-term brand.
  @cnyryan By delegating, you're freeing up time long-term. Fiverr and Upwork allow nearly any creator to outsource at an extremely reasonable price.
  @jesssaha @robertsitalia For me it‚Äôs brainstorming new products and services, writing, creating content, etc.
  @robertsitalia Putting together presentations, fonts, logos, colors, landing pages, copywriting, etc.
  @SeanAnthonySays 100%. I'm 2.5 years in and still struggle to delegate and outsource effectively.

  @SamuelCise Many thanks, Samuel. I've got a bunch of articles on there focused on growth. I hope they are helpful. Cheers.
  @shelisademuth The great thing about writing is that it's hard to actually see yourself getting better in real-time.  It's only when you look back 1-2 years and review prior work that you see the huge shift.
  @freeagentglobal Grow or atrophy.
  I've written every day for 2.5+ years now.  - Sometimes people love it. - Sometimes people hate it. - Sometimes people ignore it.  You know what?  Doesn't matter.  Getting thoughts out = growing

  @vantellus @quinnemmett Yep. I'm probably much closer to 90/10 or 95/5 if I'm being honest. But, really 80/20 is what I should shoot for.
  @quinnemmett Ha. Damn. Funny how that works, Quinn.   Use a customer testimonial and a few coupons. Generally works well for me. Here‚Äôs my last sales post (LinkedIn).  https://t.co/h6bWByicVC
  @quinnemmett Same. When I‚Äôm in the zone, I promote once a week. 80/20 give/ask.   When I go any extended period of time without doing it, I get a bit more uncomfortable.   Consistency, as always, wins.
  In the last 30 days, I've promoted my digital products once online.  Here are the results:  ‚ùå 29 days of no promotion: $3,886 ‚úÖ 1 day of promotion: $5,817  43x difference per day.  Sales don't just happen. If you're going to sell, get comfortable with self-promotion.

  Remember...you don't need permission from anyone to teach and share.   Someone out there is behind you on a similar journey.   They‚Äôre just waiting for you to show up and guide them.  Go out and start sharing your journey today.  Have a great weekend.
  1. How am I useful to others?  2. What do people want from me or my journey?  3. What do friends and family come to me for advice about?  4. Who is a few steps behind me that could benefit from my experience?
  You are further along on some journey than other people.   It could be in your career, in a certain skill, or even a hobby.  So, the best way to think about sharing, teaching, and expertise is not, "Am I an expert?" or "Am I a teacher?" but rather...
  This is a blueprint for teaching.  99% of the people that you admire online or offline are still figuring it out.   They are simply further along on their journey than you are and sharing what they‚Äôve learned so far.  The good news?
  In the movie Catch Me If You Can, Frank Abagnale is apprehended by the FBI after posing as a Sociology teacher at BYU.  When they asked him, ‚ÄúHow in the world did you teach that class?", his answer was telling:  ‚ÄúAll I had to do was read one chapter ahead of the students.‚Äù
  2. At what point does someone become an "expert"?  Most "thought leaders" that you follow online are simply more experienced in a particular subject than you are.  They don't have a degree or certificate. They just went for it.  And now they are ahead. There's a pattern here.
  1. Who ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù to teach something?  For example, most school teachers are not ‚Äúworld-renowned experts‚Äù.   They merely know more about math, writing, and geography than their students.
  To begin, people get too caught up in what it means to be an "expert".  This blinds you to the very real and very valuable knowledge you do have, that would be beneficial to others.  Here are two questions worth considering:
  Creating online is hard.  Many people believe they have nothing valuable worth sharing.  I call this "knowledge blindness"  A short thread on why you're wrong üëáüèª üëáüèª

  Self-employment vs. a 9 to 5  The variable income of self-employment keeps you innovative but on your toes.  A salary often keeps you comfortable but stagnant.  Neither is wrong, just different in shaping daily actions.  It's good to learn this before you strike out on your own.

  Honestly, craft beer &amp; wine have been a big part of my identity.  Learning to live without them isn't easy at all, but the days and nights are SO much better.  If you're thinking about cutting alcohol from your life, give it a go.  Try one week and check these 8 life categoriesüëáüèª
  My relationship with my wife is better.  We've always had a great relationship, but even a few drinks and we're both much more irritable and impatient.  Now, we have sparkling water and hot tea at night and are much more kind to one another.  It's like we're dating again.  üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®

  My bank account looks fuller!  Alcohol is expensive. We used to have a bottle of wine at night and it would cost $20 or so.  Going out for a few glasses with tax and tip? Exorbitant.  I estimate we'll save $800 - $1,000 per month with no beer, wine, or cocktails.  üí∞
  My eating choices are remarkably better.  One beer and I throw all care to the wind. It's time for hamburgers or BBQ or french fries.  Now, we're ordering salads, making fresh seafood and vegetables, and cooking 2x more than we used to.  Huge health benefits all around.  üèÉüèª
  That drink "bloat" goes away pretty fast.  I've lost 3 lbs and it's most noticeable in the areas where people bloat.  - Stomach - Face - Neck  An improvement in physical health and appearance goes a long way in better confidence and attitude.  üèãüèª
  Anxiety is down significantly.  I underestimated the impact that a few drinks have on my brain.  I used to feel FOMO, anxiety, urgency, etc. when I had drinks. Alcohol is the world's strongest depressant.  Now?  Nearly eliminated. I'm more patient, level-headed, and focused.  üôÇ
  Productivity improvements? Massive.  During COVID, a drink at 530 was normal. Once I had one, I wasn't going to do anything after. The day was over.  Now, I can use this time, or morning time (no cloudiness) to get things accomplished.   I estimate 4+ available hours gained.  üë®üèª‚Äçüíº
  Mornings are positive vs. negative  I used to wake up a bit groggy and feeling out of shape because of 225+ calories craft IPAs.  The first thought of the day was negative.  Now? Spring out of bed feeling light and excited for the day.  ‚òÄÔ∏è
  My sleep has drastically improved.  I was sleeping ~6 to 6.5 hours per night when I was having alcohol in the evening.  Getting up 2x-3x to get a glass of water or the restroom.  Now, I'm logging a solid 8 hours every night with minimal interruptions.  Huge win.  üí§

  P.S. Today, I tried something a little different.  I skipped pulling my LI audience through the blog and pulled them directly to this Tweet thread (üëã hi, again).  Later, I'll share if that was more/less successful by adding to this thread.   Cheers.
  Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope you found this small tip helpful.  If so, I'd be honored to have you join my newsletter.  I write weekly about systems &amp; processes that I use to power my solopreneur journey:  https://t.co/vCOnWlle21
  Since introducing a few weeks ago, I've been growing my email list 20x faster than I was before.  https://t.co/NqkLp2MmEf
  Since Twitter is a secondary platform for me, most of the exposure I get is to people who haven't seen me before.  I'm leveraging the inward momentum my LI audience creates.  Then I turn that into outward momentum on Twitter to grow new emails and followers.  The result?
  Step 4:   This compounding action creates "outward momentum" to a new audience here on Twitter.    That drives:  - New Twitter followers - New email subscribers  https://t.co/ciZec5FzG5
  Step 3:   The CTA at the end of my blog asks my LinkedIn &amp; email audience to take action with a Like or RT of a thread on Twitter.   This does two things:  - Brings them to a new platform (Hi üëã)  - Creates compounding action in one place.   (like this thread, I hope)  https://t.co/Kxqfzv1WWg
  Step 2:   I share the blog on LinkedIn + via my email list.  That pulls a large number of people from my pre-built audience into the blog.  I'm basically pulling 75k+ people.  This creates "inward momentum."  https://t.co/kBPcksXdUd
  Step 1:   I start by creating a long-form piece of content on my blog.  This piece will act as the center of the entire momentum web.  But the blog itself does not acquire email subscribers simply by existing.  The next step will start our momentum machine.  https://t.co/ul9Z0L8NpX
  So, in 2021, I‚Äôve been focused on using 2 types of momentum + compound attention to acquire more of both.  I'll explain in 4 simple steps.
  Fast forward to 2021, and I have 71k+ followers on LinkedIn.   And, I‚Äôve been able to support 3 different businesses through it.  But, I still have a relatively small email list (~4.1k) and Twitter following (~3.6k).
  Back in 2018, I had a hypothesis that getting some attention online would be helpful in my solopreneur journey.  When it came time to create, I picked LinkedIn.  Back then, Twitter was still a place where I got updates on the news and looked at random trends.
  After months of tinkering, my email list is growing 20x faster.  Two key factors:  - Momentum - Compound attention  If you have a following on any platform, this one could be helpful.  THREADüëáüèªüëáüèª

  @kyork20 I think wealth is so contextual. The more money we‚Äôve earned the more worried we‚Äôve actually become.   What happens if we lose it??  Super weird. Totally recognize our privilege. Such an interesting, diverse topic.
  @kyork20 What‚Äôs your takeaway?
  @kyork20 Interesting answers...
  @austinschless @GerardDawson3 @ErikJentges Thanks, Austin. Appreciate the share.
  @schlaf Not sure if they are technically non-profit, but their mission is non-profit-driven.   https://t.co/ex3ygzB1YC
  @dvassallo This is how I feel about recipes and cooking...  Making a great loaf of bread is about 20x more fulfilling than buying one. And the nutritional value is likely higher.  I suspect that when you build, you'll find a similar value increase.
  @DamianThompson Oh, I've been...it's one of my faves. She's an inspiration.
  @EarlyStageSales It's going to start happening very, very fast.  Too many options available for talented people.
  Reward outcomes, not hours.
  @AmandaMGoetz  https://t.co/JpmnlgeTSk  Susan is a CPA that came recommended through the @revenue-co and she's been excellent. Extremely well versed in the startup landscape and easy to work with.   Happy to intro.
  @cjkmccaffrey @thisiskp- I use Airtable + Gmail to fire off relevant emails as I move clients through my pipeline. Been really helpful...
  @thisiskp- It‚Äôs my favorite tool for my advising business today. I‚Äôve automated so much cumbersome work using triggers.   Game changer.
  @collincadmus @chrisbits92 Agree with Collin.  I started around 20k, back when 20k was like 40k today.  I wish I would have even waited longer.
  @mattragland Do you even meditate??

  @suhanachooli Sure thing, Suhana. Thanks for giving this a read. Glad you found some value in it. Cheers.
  @joshua-hornby Thanks, Josh!
  @joshua-hornby Personalized connection requests look like cold sales pitches waiting to happen, IMO.  If you're going to personalize it, try saying, "Love your content. Would like to connect to make sure I see it in my feed every day". Do 5-10 per day.
  @SamuelBriskar Nothing more than just posting to LinkedIn with a coupon and letting people know there will only be 20 or so...  I don't do ads or paid marketing, just social media. Hope that helps!
  @SamuelBriskar Mostly just word of mouth sharing, and a few promotions. I don't promote often, but I'll get a nice spike when I choose to.
  @domm  https://t.co/C77pa7u5n9
  @jenniferlund Thanks, Jennifer. I appreciate you reading and sharing. I know it was a long one!
  @StabileGabe Appreciate it, Gabe. Thems some big goals. üî•
  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this long thread.   If you found this helpful, I'd be honored if you checked out my newsletter.   https://t.co/vCOnWlle21  I write once a week about processes and systems that work for my solopreneur journey.  Cheers.
  So, to get started, do the following:  Step 1: Pick something you excel at. Step 2: Choose something you're interested in. Step 3: Combine them creatively. Step 4: Weave a distribution system. Step 5: Allow an audience to form. Step 6: Ask them what they need.
  Summary:  In summary, the internet is getting crowded.  Picking your passion and then trying to write or record from scratch each day can be a very daunting task.  Most of the compelling creators you see online have a system.
  Others might want a Zoom call where you apply your formula to bottles in their collection together.  Some would just want to purchase a financial analysis of multiple bottles, without the call.  All of this can be placed on a value ladder that people can move up over time:  https://t.co/mphKIFv8UT
  Ask on social or send out a survey via email. What would they like to learn? What would they be happy to spend some money on?  For example, people might enjoy a digital course teaching them your method behind wine price projections.
  No. 6: Product  Now comes the easiest part. Asking and listening.  With an audience built around a specific, unique idea, you can simply start to ask them what would be most helpful, and listen to their answers.   It‚Äôs amazing how many people skip this critical step.
  If you‚Äôre our finance/wine person from above, you will naturally attract an audience of people who love wine, sommeliers, and collectors.   But, you‚Äôre also likely to attract people who have an interest in data analysis, financial trends, the market, the exchanges, and so on.
  By distributing routinely, a natural audience will grow.   Remember, you don‚Äôt pick your audience, they pick you.   You simply set up a system where more people are likely to find you.
  Here's where I'd recommend focusing and how I set up my own distribution (h/t to @GoodMarketingHQ for the structure idea, which I've changed a bit)  - Personal blog or newsletter - One social site to start - Industry sites - Private Slack Channels - Facebook groups  https://t.co/K4X9kTIG2m
  Having a niche of one gives you an advantage bc you‚Äôve increased the number of places you can distribute.   For example, if you‚Äôre our financial whiz/wine lover, you can distribute on sites centered around wine, the wine exchange, but also finance sites, market sites, etc.
  No. 4 &amp; 5: Distribution &amp; Audience  In order for people to discover your unique and interesting idea, they have to be able to find it. This is where distribution comes into play.   Your audience is an OUTCOME of good distribution.
  It's one single idea that can be produced and reproduced 1000x over.  The game of ‚Äúwhat do I do today?‚Äù is now over.  These ideas, when shared broadly through proper distribution, attract a natural audience of interested people.
  Example: You‚Äôre a financial analyst &amp; your interest is in wine.  Unique idea: Use your financial knowledge to project the value of one high-end wine bottle each morning.  You could easily argue that this idea is not interesting, but you‚Äôd be missing the larger point.  https://t.co/QfEnNWDHI7
  We‚Äôre back to the same old questions:  ‚ÄúWhat do I write about today?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do I paint today?" ‚ÄúWhat do I teach today?‚Äù  In a niche of one, you create one idea, and then learn how to say it, do it, or package it 1,000+ different ways.  Let‚Äôs use an example from above.
  For example, we‚Äôve all had ideas before, but they end up as:  - Unfinished blog posts - Abandoned podcasts - Dwindling YouTube channels  That‚Äôs because the creation must be forced.   You‚Äôre starting from a blank canvas every morning.
  No. 3: Idea  The idea block of a niche of one is where most people get it wrong.   They let a lack of creativity keep them from building something unique.
  Maybe you're fluent in English &amp; Portuguese and you‚Äôre extremely well-versed in marketing. Maybe you understand financial analysis and your hobby is high-end wine.  So, now what?  Let‚Äôs put one of them together to start formulating an interesting idea.
  Let‚Äôs introduce interests into the equation and see what happens.  No 2: Interests  This article is not meant to be cliche: ‚ÄúDo something you love and you‚Äôll never work a day in your life!‚Äù   Nonsense.  But, interests are important. They keep us...well‚Ä¶interested.
  The difficulty arises when the inevitable question comes up:  ‚ÄúWhat do I write about today?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do I paint today?" "What do I teach today?‚Äù  When the brain faces a creative block, people either quit creating or create something subpar. Two poor outcomes.  https://t.co/maIheWmCie
  Too often, people make the mistake of choosing a skill when deciding to create online.   I‚Äôm a writer, so I‚Äôll write.  I‚Äôm a painter, so I‚Äôll paint.  I know how to do X, so I‚Äôll teach people how to do X.   You get the point.
  Let's break them down and then put them back together to help you get started.  No 1: Skill  Most skills, by themselves, are not unique. Lots of people can write, speak English and Portuguese, or do financial analysis.
  A niche of one is a unique combination of skills &amp; interests rolled into one idea and distributed through highly creative or technical content.  You become the category creator. The best in show. The only.  Here are the six building blocks behind a Niche of One.  https://t.co/AFoTizjSYq
  The most compelling creators online are "a niche of one."  I've broken that down into 6 steps.  Let's do a deep dive. üëáüèª
  @lexpaval @icons-8 Excellent work, Alex. üî•üî•
  @narcoustic @amypeniston Nope, I figured I might as well show them what's working and what's not.  I think they appreciated the transparency along the way, which made them more likely to buy. I don't have data backing that up, but it's a gut feel.
  @narcoustic @amypeniston Prelaunch was just an announcement with an early-bird discount. Then I built in public over that month.   Launch was simply announcing that it's coming out in X hours and this was your last chance to get it at the discounted rate.
  @amypeniston @narcoustic I pre-launched my 2nd course on December 18th, and then launched it January 18th. Both days had pretty big spikes.
  @constructionge3 I just mean to keep the price low enough that you don't exclude 90% of people like other courses do.
  @tejas3732 @gumroad I have 2 products. One to help people grow their audience on LinkedIn, and one to help people ideate and put together a digital product.
  @TheStartUpSDR Thanks so much, Arthur. Appreciate it.
  @AZinkevich Thanks, Andrei. Best of luck on the launch. Lmk how it goes!
  @aaraalto You rock. Thanks, Aaron. Great job.
  @YanceySanderson Gut feel honestly.
  @MightyFineCopy- @jmcmillen89 We loved Las Quince Letras. Have you been there?  There was another little restaurant we stopped at that I need to find...
  @MightyFineCopy- @jmcmillen89 I salute you for living in Oaxaca. One of my favorite places. Jealous.
  @nazzagnl Cool. LMK if you have any questions, Nazzareno.  Cheers, man.
  @walkingriver @gumroad Audience is important. üòÉ
  @M-Gagliano More signups and completions on first course.   The 2nd course will make more money bc its 3x the price.
  @M-Gagliano My last course was way too long. 3 hours and 28 minutes.  My first one? 75 minutes. MUCH easier to get through.  That said, I think the longer course is more valuable.
  @jmcmillen89 About 75/25 social media vs. email list. I've also spent 2.5 years writing on LI each morning so it's paid off...
  @walkingriver @gumroad I have 70k followers on LinkedIn, so that helps.   Pricing for access means making it affordable and accessible for people.   That's just my mantra because I can help more people and, in turn, they can tell more people.
  @aaraalto "Beautiful things don‚Äôt ask for attention."
  @jmcmillen89 Thanks, Jacob. Appreciate it, man.
  @BrentHolzheimer @gumroad Awesome - you're welcome, Brent.
  @1pBetterDaily @Hustle-Smarterr Thank you!
  @WillAttract @gumroad Appreciate it, Will!
  @getpaidwrite @gumroad Thanks!
  @JanelSGM Thanks, Janel!   I actually featured you in my new course, so hopefully more people will learn about your NewsletterOS and the awesome stuff you're creating.
  @fbourdeau I haven't really given it much thought. It's mostly just fun for me, not something I'm actively trying to scale.  That could change in the future though...
  @ChrisRocas Appreciate you, Chris. Cheers, man.
  @fbourdeau Appreciate you, Francois. Thanks, as always, for your support.
  @HilaryCorna @gumroad Sure thing, Hilary. Best of luck to you!
  @EarlyStageSales @thescottleese I try. Feel like there's no point in being someone different.
  @Ali-Merchant @gumroad Thanks, Ali. Appreciate your support, my man. Always.
  @EarlyStageSales Thanks, man. Really fun ride.
  Excited to move up the @gumroad board in 2021.
  Hit $100k in revenue today.  All organic.  Here are 5 lessons I learned in 10 months:  1. Give 80%, Ask 20% 2. Brevity in courses is your friend 3. Price for access &amp; word of mouth 4.

  @chadladjev Ha. I use that phrase a lot being from the Midwest. It's a habit.
  @debgotwired Outside of all of the free content I push out, I offer two courses on this subject as well.  You can check them out here:   https://t.co/DzX2ZVTWiV
  @debgotwired I don't actually write on trends (Ironically, today was the one day I did) - I use a system of pillars &amp; core concepts. Essentially, I have a list of strong beliefs that I visit when I'm feeling creative. I'll usually write 4-5 posts at o
  @debgotwired Sure thing. Here they all are:    https://t.co/ST3ZL528wN  I've also been writing every morning for 2.5 years. I saw very little traction until about month 10, but then it's been compounding like crazy.
  @debgotwired What do you mean exactly? Sorry, want to make sure I understand what you're asking.
  @debgotwired @arvidkahl More inbox messages than I could ever count, 30k+ website visitors and about $668k in sales.
  @sunnsidemedia I don‚Äôt recommend it.
  @BGroat Well, shit, man. Thanks.   Glad it kicked off some decent thoughts. Appreciate the kind shout.
  @mattboneal @JamesClear Appreciate being in the same Tweet with one of my favorite authors.   Thanks, Matthew. Cheers.
  @corprteUnicorn Feel this.
  @briannekimmel Walked away from my executive role to work for myself.

  @DanishAgg Awesome - greatly appreciate that compliment, Danish.
  @russleads Appreciate the share and the kind words, Russ. Cheers, man.
  @jackmjfoster Appreciate you sharing, Jack. Cheers.
  @HilaryCorna Yep, try this: "Does anyone need to read this?"
  @thinkingovertea Basically üôè
  @HilaryCorna That's awesome, Hilary. Nice work, and keep the momentum moving.
  @laurieharrison Very infrequently, but yes. Probably once every other month or so.
  @laurieharrison I don‚Äôt, to be honest. When I‚Äôm feeling creative, I might write 3-5 posts. When I‚Äôm not, zero.   I also recognize that even knowledge I think has no value, often does to other people.
  @furkanpatan1 I try, but haven't found my Twitter "footing" yet.
  @rwilk Thanks so much for reading it, Robert. Cheers.
  @realDavidGomez I‚Äôm sure they work but I go at it the old fashioned way.   Consistent output and trying to get 1% better each day.
  @Nicolascole77 Thanks for sharing, Nicolas. Big fan of your essays. Cheers.
  @MikethePBM @uxblake I do not. I do everything via Gumroad, but I'll upgrade in the future at some point.
  @macedoh I don't actually know if it works on Twitter. I haven't really figured this platform out since I've spent most of my time on LinkedIn.  Sometimes I ask a question, but it feels "baity" if that makes sense...
  @ErinKGibbens Once someone does for me...haha.
  @austinschless @uxblake @AlexLlullTW Could be true. I mostly share intentional content that helps solopreneurs run their business so it's not anything that people might find offensive or anything.
  @lukecannon727 I got more where that came from. Jk.   No secrets here, just helpful knowledge that I figured out over time.
  @nmsubra Steal away!
  @austinschless Yeah, I think that would work. I'm much less comfortable with Twitter, so I hesitate to give advice like I would on LinkedIn.  Two guys who are nailing it and helping people grow on Twitter:  @uxblake  @AlexLlullTW
  @LenaSesardic Appreciate you sharing this, Lena. üôå
  @Ali-Merchant If you don't like my stuff, blame me :)  Thanks for sharing, Ali. Appreciate it, my man.
  @austinschless So, rather than Tweet 3x per day, I'll probably just share less often, but with the hope of providing more value in each Tweet.
  @austinschless It's interesting. I just picked LinkedIn 2.5 years ago without much thought.  So, each hour I spend there is more valuable than an hour on Twitter at the moment.   I enjoy sharing threads like these on Twitter because people seem to get a l
  @PeterPLai Of course. Using LI has been a game-changer. Growing organically is a bit easier than Twitter. Hope to see you on there!  Cheers.
  @PeterPLai I guess it depends on where you work and how they might think about it.  To me, my social media is mine, so that's how I've always treated it.   At the same time, I keep it pretty clean and helpful on LinkedIn, but that's just sort of who I am 
  @wiesman Thanks so much for the share. Glad you found it helpful. Cheers.
  @markotalks It's mostly about consistency. That seems to be the key.  I've written every weekday for 2+ years now.
  @wiesman Yes - it definitely takes time, but it's one of the easier platforms to build an audience. I've been writing for over 2+ years consistently.  Try 2x to 3x per week for a month and you'll see some decent results.
  @hvidtfeld Appreciate that, Magnus. Thanks for taking the time to read it.
  @thealibilawal It definitely works, the tricky part is not overdoing it. So, this is about 1 of 5 systems I follow when writing.
  @bausbrooks- Thanks so much for sharing, Brandon (and for the kind words!)
  @AlexLlullTW Super kind of you to share this, Alex. I appreciate that.  Just on here learning from you.

  @edchao2 Really interesting. I'm thinking of trailer like a movie trailer, but I never considered it could be thought of like a trailer being pulled by a car. Ha.
  @im-usamakhalid Appreciate that, Usama. Cheers, man.
  @kylewill Thanks for spending the time to read it, Kyle. Greatly appreciated. Cheers.
  @-beesea- Awesome, glad you found it helpful. Thanks for taking the time to read it, B√º≈üra.
  @TKaljo Thanks! This one was a lot of fun to write, to be honest.
  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. If you found this helpful, I'd be honored if you checked out my newsletter.  I write about once a week and try and processes and systems that work for my solopreneur journey.   https://t.co/GOmWBLygMj
  So, remember:  - Step 1: Start with the meat. What are you teaching or suggesting? - Step 2: Create your trailer. Does each line get people to the next?  - Step 3: Make it easy to engage. Leave them with a short summary.
  This particular post was seen 72,477 times, for 867 interactions and 166 comments. This is in line with a typical post for me each day.  https://t.co/Mhmy2kR3Sp
  I want the reader to participate in the comments without having to reread the full piece.   So, I summarize it nicely for them at the end.  People read the last few lines, think of a response, and get participating.  https://t.co/GV6BqB89jZ
  Step 3: The Summary and The Mantra  It's time to wrap the content.  My goal in the ending is to give the reader the entire piece of content packaged up nicely in a few sentences. Think of it as the summary of the content.
  The hook line is the last line before the "‚Ä¶see more" button on the feed.  It's where readers commit to reading more or continuing their scroll.   If they click "see more", the trailer has done its job and they are onto the "meat", which I've already shared with you.  https://t.co/be4lAmjavn
  I know my audience cares about getting people's attention.   The 1st line is short and gets their attention when scrolling.  The second line recommends they "help them in public". If they want to do that, they move to the 3rd line, the hook line:   "Here are 4 simple ideas:"
  Step Two: Write The "Trailer"  The trailer has 2 jobs:  - Break the scroll pattern with the first line. - Make each line intriguing enough to get the reader to the next one.  Here's the trailer for this particular piece of content.  https://t.co/YWK5CHCRxH
  Step one: Create the "Meat" of the content  The meat is the information I'm attempting to convey or teach. For example, I wanted to teach people how to get someone's attention on LinkedIn.   So, I wrote out 4 suggestions:  https://t.co/k6yR0B1TOo
  Twitter generally hates LinkedIn.   But, I've generated 33.038M impressions in the last 2 years and built my business on it.  Here's one simple 3-step process I use for creating content quickly.  If interested, feel free to steal itüëáüèª
  @ryangum Yeah, I've just got a big following on LinkedIn, and haven't put the time into Twitter. I expect that as I do, things could change. Rebuilding landing pages now, so excited to release.
  @ryangum The launch month ended up over $40k. In the last week, I've made about $2k, but haven't promoted yet (on purpose).  I have automation set up to ask for reviews on Gumroad to drive the conversion rates up. Once that happens, I'll start actively pr
  @ryangum Really interesting post, Ryan. Thanks for including me with some folks I admire greatly. Cheers.
  @thealibilawal Just how they are incentivized. Learn that and make much better choices.
  Learn how people get paid.   You‚Äôll make significantly better life choices.
  @kbdotfyi @Guideline401k Very cool. Not familiar with this company.  My wife, who manages our money, recently read The Simple Path to Wealth by @JLCollinsNH   Changed how we think about independence quite a bit. Highly recommend.
  @poojalapasia It's such an important exercise in improving my mental health.
  @Ali-Merchant Thanks, Ali. I stress a lot about money, like most people.  When I sit down and go over my plan, it's such an immense feeling of relief. I highly recommend.

  @harrydry Perfect timing. Building a new landing page and now I've got a guide. Massive, Harry.
  @jackbutcher Depends on your ability to tune out noise and sift through content built specifically to generate views rather than educate.   Learn? Yes.  Get distracted? Yes.   Conquer no. 2 and no. 1 is much easier today.

  @thealibilawal That's right.   Money is an outcome of other skills. But receiving it, in and of itself, is skilless.
  Making money is not a skill.  It's an outcome.
  @MikethePBM @5harath @uxblake Thank you my man. Much appreciated.
  @kenfitzg Hell yeah, Ken. See you on the journey. üí™üèª
  @hmizel Observation, motivational, analytical, tear down, etc.
  @BGroat I love it. Platforms, to me, are all valuable. You just need to navigate and understand. Once you do, you can establish meaningful relationships on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, whatever.   Add value and get value.
  @AmandaMGoetz Writing.  I‚Äôve published every day for 2.5 years. Went back and looked at some old stuff. Yikes.   P.S. My wife is hooked on the sleep CBD. üí§
  @BGroat Thanks so much, Brian.  The Twitterverse has a lot of negative feelings re: LinkedIn but you get out what you put in.  It's been a business changing channel for me.
  @jessholsapple1 Exactly. This is what I was attempting to capture. Love that, Jessica.
  @chadladjev So far so good! 35 new students today and still have 36 minutes until the release.
  @atsaminathan Yep - this is a message people need to hear often. Action leads to growth. Intentional action leads to success.
  @mattlady Thanks, Matt. I've been doing this for the last few months and the outcomes become tough pills to swallow.  That helps push me along when I don't want to move.
  Reframe how you talk about fear.  Instead of stating your fear, state the potential outcome.  It's not, "I'm too afraid to get started."   It's, "By never starting, I'm choosing future regret over slight discomfort now."  This helps drive action for me.
  @joshcolter Awesome! Thanks for the support. Let‚Äôs go...

  @shl üëÄ  Already investing a bit, but tell me more...
  @MikethePBM Hey Mike - not connecting could simply be an outcome of low visibility.   How are you sharing? Just on Twitter?
  @Dmurr68 @davegerhardt @nevmed @YouTube @HubSpot @Google @ecomchasedimond @TaylorOffer Thanks for the nice mention here, Daniel.  I always truly appreciate you taking the time to shine a spotlight on others.
  @tonystark2020s I'll never understand that "People person" to sales translation.  It's like saying, "I like football so I'm thinking about trying out for the NFL as a career."  Sales is a skill like throwing a ball and requires zero "people person-ing".
  @sylvainreiter Exactly. Your ideas reach millions of people.  Some may say, "I knew that".   To others? Gold.
  @joshua-hornby Impostor syndrome can be crippling.  What I'm describing is actually less impostor syndrome and more an assumption that our knowledge is common when it's not.   We just think it is because we can't imagine not knowing it!
  @fbourdeau We incorrectly assume that our journey, because we've been on it, is known by all.   I've done this so many times.
  @edward-gorbis The knowledge you think, "everyone knows" is often the most helpful.
  People vastly underestimate the value of their knowledge.  Publish it and be pleasantly surprised.
  @ohpinion8ted When someone responds to your published position and suggests something different, you're forced to consider a viewpoint you hadn't previously considered.  Am I wrong to think that puts me in a position to think more critically?
  @ohpinion8ted The Tweet doesn't suggest that writing drives critical thinking.  It's having to defend my thoughts in public that is the driver.
  @MikethePBM (Obviously Clubhouse is unrelated to this specific tweet about writing)
  @MikethePBM I publish on LinkedIn, LinkedIn Newsletter, Twitter, a little on Quora, Clubhouse, 2 private Slack channels, and once in a while on Medium.
  @Ali-Merchant Thanks, Ali. Between LinkedIn, Twitter, and several other sites, I've produced nearly 900 pieces of short content.  Been wild to look back and see the progress.  Keep it going. You will not regret it.
  @EarlyStageSales When you've hit the 6-month mark (or even 3) look backward.   You'll be amazed at your progress as a writer or creator.
  I've written every day for 2.5 years now.  Publishing my thoughts means having to defend them.  Such natural practice for thinking more critically.
  @orangebook- Damn.   A simple, effective, necessary question.
  @KishlaySays I do a bunch of things:  - Run an advisory firm for early-stage health tech SaaS companies.  - I‚Äôm an executive coach to founders.  - I build digital products online - I‚Äôm an LP at a rolling fund
  @KishlaySays Yep. Pharma and Med device from 2003-2009.
  @jbplat Yep. Overnight success stories are never actually overnight.   You just weren't paying attention when they were failing.
  @WalkerLucas At the time, yes.   Now? Zero.   I deserved it and it was a tough lesson that made me who I am today.
  @GuyLigertwood Same üòÄ
  @Ali-Merchant Same here. My failures were the lead up to my successes.
  @edward-gorbis @cjpattss I needed to learn that my actions had consequences. Once I learned that...life became a lot better.

  @anthilemoon @JamesClear Do you drink Americanos? Became my house drink a few years back.
  @creation247 Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
  @JamesClear 1) Negroni.   It‚Äôs a classic 1:1:1 ratio but I pour a slightly heavy hand of Sipsmith Gin. Combine with Campari and Antica Vermouth.   2) Americano  Sub out gin in the above drink and add club soda. A delicious, bitter Italian aperitif that ev
  @projectkwill Same here. Just get it done.
  @joshua-hornby @SteveBartlettSC I absolutely love this. Going to consider doing my own text group.   Thank you for sharing.
  @joshua-hornby No science on why, just some reported data from studies.   For me, the choice was about bursts.   I‚Äôve always felt like I excelled when forced to produce rapidly and then took breaks.   Might be more personal than anything.
  @JaviEug Same here. Optimism leads to creative thinking.   Creative thinking leads to creative solutions and better outcomes.
  @JoePompliano @JJWatt @JustinTuck @lancearmstrong @darrenrovell Their Run Wild IPA is phenomenal.  I'm interested to see how companies like Athletic Brewing push the big brewers to commit to something NA. Already happening at Brooklyn Brewing.
  @vickks Thanks, Vivek. I‚Äôve just seen it over and over again.
  @Ali-Merchant Bucket 1 can be ok if it‚Äôs a fleeting thought. It just can‚Äôt be turned into an ideology.   Bucket 2 is learned by overcoming bucket 1 again and again.
  @edward-gorbis Damn. Love that.
  @thealibilawal It‚Äôs remarkable how many people have hardwired themselves to believe everything is impossible.
  Optimism is a business super power.   Great leaders solve problems before pessimists finish talking about why it can‚Äôt be done.
  @scottbsales @kyleplacy @Its-Jenn-Here No but Ny interest is piqued!
  @scottbsales @kyleplacy I hate small talk. Clubhouse is my nightmare.
  @thealibilawal Yep. I've been writing daily for 30 months now.  When I started, I was slow and awful.  Now a bit faster and slightly better.
  How to create content more quickly:  Step 1 - Make a  list of strong opinions  Step 2 - Make a list of favorite content structures  Step 3 - Combine &amp; brain dump  Step 4 - Edit  Step 5 - Post
  @TheJackieHermes Haha. Thanks, Jackie. üòÄ
  @tyleramarcus @gurd3v Thanks, Tyler. Appreciate you reading.
  @gurd3v It's a short read and maybe the best actual "blog" or long-form I've written, IMO. I hate long-form writing.
  @gurd3v I've had impostor syndrome my whole life. I've found that harnessing it can actually be quite powerful.  I also try to think through impostor syndrome objectively.   I wrote an article about it, actually.   https://t.co/RtpijzTlHg
  @MikeyMHook Yep - it's great to think through this often so when you panic one day (it will happen) you've already been through the exercise enough to stay calm.
  @taimurharry Start by micro-niching. Combine skills + interests to create a "niche of one".  This is literally the foundation behind my new course.
  @Ali-Merchant Yep - then it's, "what can I do to extend this?" or "what other bets can I make that are easy and could have a big impact?".
  @michaelwolber Thanks, Mike. I feel like most people worry about this, and it's totally ok.   Just rethink the outcomes and you'll realize it's likely not worth worrying so much.
  @KevinEkmark Exactly. I feel like the skills I‚Äôve learned as a solopreneur could be extremely useful in a company setting if I ever need to do that.
  @thescottleese I worry about failure every day, which keeps me driving forward.   Reframing the outcomes helps me remember that everything is likely going to be OK.
  Something I ask myself every day is, "What if I fail as a solopreneur?"  Here's my answer:  The worst outcome is I go back to work in tech.  The best outcome is I live the life I want with total control.  Huge upside. Decent downside.  Daily reminders reduce fear &amp; stress.
  @jaclynmullen @nicklowthorpe @businessbarista The stigma attached to sales is because most people are bad at it.   Truly incredible salespeople are nothing like how they are portrayed in the movies, TV, etc.
  @sacca @Browns @BuffaloBills I don‚Äôt know anyone doing this.   If you are, please stop. Go Browns.  (From a nervous Browns fan up 25)
  Everyone is so focused on doing what they love.  I just want to avoid what I hate.
  @nicklowthorpe @businessbarista That‚Äôs so interesting. A huge misconception is that selling is an art.   It‚Äôs a science that one can learn so when people learn it, they get a huge leg up on their competition.
  @businessbarista - selling - critical thinking - data analysis
  @pm @semil The idea that Parler will be deciding something they have already decided themselves is silly at best, misleading at worst.
  @arteeninLA September. It's just a guess and a cheap flight so I can repurpose if we're not ready.
  @george-mack Good Lord is this an excellent Tweet.
  @Natalie-Furn September right now...Too hot in the summer.
  @Natalie-Furn Merida, MX.
  @ProductIsLife Haha. I‚Äôm sure you are not.
  @ErinKGibbens Airlines are offering flexible changes right now, meaning if I can't travel because of COVID, I can use it another time.
  @dvglantin Debatable! :)
  @vyara Therapeutic.
  @LenaSesardic Oof üòÇ
  @LenaSesardic Me too. Just looking around at restaurants and tours has been fun. It's highly unlikely, but...good for my brain.
  @LenaSesardic Merida, MX.
  I just booked a 100% refundable, post-COVID vacation.  Feel like this is really good for my soul.  May never go, but just putting one together rewires my brain.
  @ijaurec I definitely give my take on politics quite often. No shame in that game, IMO.  I just don't argue with people until it becomes problematic and I don't obsess over it until it consumes my life.  Too much trouble there.
  @Ali-Merchant Thanks! Always my goal.   I hate all the pomp and circumstance when buying so I skip it when selling.
  @Ali-Merchant Yep. That feels like the right way to do it.  If you take people on your journey as a teacher, the promotion comes naturally (at least it has for me so far)
  @bdrhoa You can deliver short-term results in a long-term relationship.  What I meant by that is, if you keep saying yes to every dollar that comes your way, regardless of fit or length of the relationship, you'll struggle to set yourself up for long term
  @Ali-Merchant Absolutely. Anything, in particular, that's been extra challenging?
  @SolidGoldNicole I've niched down so far that every client I take on is exactly in my bullseye. Been so helpful.
  @YanceySanderson  https://t.co/jV0j3uOtBA
  @EarlyStageSales @zapier Love both, glad they were helpful!
  @thealibilawal Of course. Hoping these benefit someone out there.
  @mission50k Well, thanks, Dylan.   Figure if I ran into these, thousands of others probably have to. Cheers, man.
  4 hard lessons from 17 months of self-employment:  - If you're unsure, say no - Eliminate / automate / delegate - Share results in public ‚Üí gain attention - Chase short-term $ ‚Üí miss long-term $$$
  @edward-gorbis @LuisANavia @justinekedi @AyAy-Ron69 @timsalau Appreciate you, Edward.
  @mission50k @money-seeds @Wealthsimple Yeah I can appreciate that process and the enjoyment for sure.   I had a helluva time with Wealthsimple customer service so I went to Wealthfront.
  @mission50k @money-seeds Hey Dylan - Have you tried Wealthfront? Free and does an exceptionally good tracking this.   Started using it about 8 months ago.
  @deckerspectre Agreed.
  @Dmurr68 Nah. Just early!
  @Dmurr68 Thanks for the shout, my man.  Cheers ü•Ç
  @timbarnes10 Exactly. Obviously, we all need to move our businesses forward, but I prefer to skip the pomp and circumstance of backroom messaging and massaging of statements.
  One of the great benefits of solopreneurship is that I can work underneath my own values.   I don‚Äôt have to report to a workplace that pretends to care about yesterday.
  @JuiceboxCA @PixarSoul Great takeaway. Watched it last night and that never occurred to me.   Excellent movie.   Would be interested to see what the book equivalent of Soul is i.e. delivers a similar message.
  @kyork20 The least lonely thing ever.   More time with my wife and the people I enjoy.   That's my 2 cents!
  @Jessicameher @WalkerLucas I feel like I could go down a rabbit hole with rap quotes on this one.
  The best people on Twitter have become their own product.  Zero competition.  A niche of one.
  @vyara Absolutely I did.
  @LenaSesardic When someone introduces you to someone else without asking your permission.  The double opt-in is standard.   ‚ÄúHi Lena - wanted to intro you to my friend who needs XYZ (see her email below) - that ok with you?‚Äù
  @WalkerLucas I‚Äôve had that happen a few times. This person tonight was just like:  ‚ÄúHey! Never asked permission but meet this random person and hop on the phone to help her out!‚Äù  Wacky.
  I just got a single opt-in intro.  Very simple rule:  - Don't do that. Ever.
  @edward-gorbis @Twitter @FitFounder @dvassallo @APompliano I enjoy @yongfook @ThatChristinaG and @schlaf   Always very solid.
  @edward-gorbis @Twitter @FitFounder @dvassallo @APompliano Thanks, my man. Love these accounts as well. Cheers, Edward.
  @EarlyStageSales Every morning I wake up to 100k+ people talking about politics on the trending section of Twitter...  But they "don't have time" for meaningful things.   SMH.
  I know people that have ruined their lives arguing politics online.  - Lost their mind - Lost their family - Lost their friends - Even lost their job  And do you know what impact they've made?  Zero.
  @ericjacobbutton @uxblake Damn, I love that quote. Thanks for sharing.
  @jeffignacio Yep. If you hate something, Christ, stop doing it.
  @uxblake Very underrated. It‚Äôs painful to watch someone produce something when their heart is so out of it.
  It‚Äôs easy to tell when a creator doesn‚Äôt like what they are doing.  Quitting isn't always a bad decision.
  @kathleencelmins That's awesome. 2 hours is a bit too much for my attention span, so that's why I chose 1.  Tinker around and see what works for you. Good luck!
  @sughanthans1 @mikaelfyi I just celebrate with something small (read a chapter of a book or catch an episode of my favorite show) whenever I accomplish something small and meaningful.  I don't break anything down, I just go with what feels natural.  Remem
  @chadladjev I have three dogs. They are just small and are mostly indoor dogs (&lt;10lbs)
  @Sysode @jasonvana @EliusSantos @ThatChristinaG Hey Reece - it takes a ton of time and effort. I‚Äôve been doing it for 2.5 years every single weekday.   But...damn...worth it. I run my whole business off of it.
  @Dmurr68 @andreasjonssonn @chrisbits92 @ameliasordell Really nice of you to say, Daniel. üôèüèª  I'm sure, with your commitment, you'll be lapping me soon :)
  @andreasjonssonn @chrisbits92 @Dmurr68 @ameliasordell Thanks, homie!
  @MikethePBM @Sathyanand1985 @daily-visual @JamesClear @uxblake @craigburgess @dickiebush Thanks so much, Mike. There are a lot of great follows out there:  Check out @thepatwalls &amp; @sweatystartup.  Great content from both.
  @kennethburke423 Dunno. I think anything is possible when you set the right expectations.
  @kennethburke423 We both get up at the same time (6a-ish) but I've rejiggered my Calendly to take meetings from 10:30a to 2:30p.   Our walks are from 8:30a to 10:00a, then I shower and get the day started.
  @jabbawy @dwilliamriggs @Shopify @privy Very cool, thanks for sharing, Ben. Just sent out an update to my list today where I've shown my contacts are worth about $1.10 per year, but I'm a solopreneur with a few info products.  Going to be interesting to s
  @dwilliamriggs @jabbawy @Shopify Interesting. Is this suggesting the yearly value of an email is $33? Seems high to me, but then again, I'm just a solo creator without my emails optimized or anything like that.
  @JeffHawkes @wacky-packy @gumroad Awesome. Thank you so much for the support, Jeff. Almost done. Can‚Äôt wait to release.
  @edward-gorbis Thanks, Edward!
  @JamesBerges1 One of my favorite authors is @JamesClear   I need to reread this year.
  @edward-gorbis I agree with this so much. Keeps me feeling like I have a life during this pandemic.
  @Ptwittee @getshieldapp Boom! Congrats :)
  @mikaelfyi - Walk to get a coffee with my wife - Read a chapter of a fiction book - Catch an episode of Schitt's Creek - Listen to some music - Go out to lunch  Small celebrations during the work day make them feel special.
  @hrishio But big wins come from the consistency and aggregation of small wins. So why not celebrate those?
  @NickB2005 I agree. We celebrated a lot at my previous job, and I do now that I'm a solopreneur. It can get pretty miserable if you're not congratulating yourself every once in a while.
  @tpelligrino @SlackHQ @NotionHQ That's awesome, man. Take yourself out and celebrate.
  As a culture, we've normalized celebrating only big wins.  To me, a motivating habit is to celebrate small accomplishments, much more often.  Celebrate 2-3 times every day.  Anyone else applied this?
  @wacky-packy @gumroad Thanks, Imran! Looking fwd to getting this out there soon, my man.
  @sharfunnisa Of course. No credit needed. I‚Äôm not the first person to do it, I‚Äôm sure...
  @engelbreX Concretely and quantitatively it lowered my weight and blood pressure.   It also greatly reduced my stress.  Being away from the phone and engaged with my wife for 90 minutes was great.
  @tami-mcqueen @BIPCapital Super dope. Congrats, Tami üí™üèª
  @edward-gorbis Oh, I have for sure. I‚Äôve been self-aware enough to realize that it‚Äôs irritating :)   So now we talk about the future, dreams, fun stuff...It‚Äôs a great walk through Shelby Park here in Nashville.
  @YudaTeich Start with just 15 minutes. Work your way up. You got it ü§õüèª
  @edward-gorbis Much happier. I tend to talk about work when I‚Äôm walking so I need to tamp that down a bit...
  @s3rgioaguirre Yep - the 2 toddlers is the difference. No kids here, just 3 dogs.  Your plan sounds great, though.
  @YudaTeich What‚Äôs standing in your way, at the moment?
  @s3rgioaguirre Just about a week. Stronger legs, better stamina, more ideas, happier couple.
  - I'm bad at disconnecting from my phone - I'm bad at finding time to exercise each day - I'm bad at finding alone time with my wife  So, last year, I combined all 3.  90-minute, no phone, 6 mile walks each AM with my wife.   Game changer.
  @uxblake @mateogrowth @PaikCapital Thanks, Mateo. No FOMO necessary. We‚Äôre all just figuring it out on this journey of life. üí™üèª
  @atsaminathan @andreasjonssonn @dvassallo @visualizevalue @davegerhardt @CJ-Johnson17th I feel like BOST was a very, very worthwhile purchase.  It's really about the principles needed to think through how to build online over the long-term.  It's not gimm
  @Natalie-Furn @andreasjonssonn @dvassallo @visualizevalue @davegerhardt @CJ-Johnson17th @freelancenotion LinkedIn has incredible organic reach at the moment.   Also, IndieHackers has some nice channels too.   I just prereleased my next info product on Lin
  @Natalie-Furn @andreasjonssonn @dvassallo @visualizevalue @davegerhardt @CJ-Johnson17th Absolutely. Why not?   Do you have a good channel for distribution?
  @Miche-McLennan @edward-gorbis @Dmurr68 @mayagrosmn @jessicachenpage @SoulcastMedia @timsalau Thanks, Edward!
  @PatScanlan94 @ScottIngram I'll probably try that at some point. Just feel like I can get into a good groove for 60. It's probably different for everyone.
  @MiaKiraki  https://t.co/XrfrvwHWaS
  @Adgenius  https://t.co/XrfrvwHWaS  Mostly principles around building online, growing on Twitter, and helping write better...really enjoyed them.
  @Ali-Merchant Thanks, Ali. Appreciate that, man.
  @andreasjonssonn - Anyone Can Grow a Twitter Audience by @dvassallo  - Build Once, Sell Twice by @visualizevalue  - The Laws of Copywriting by @davegerhardt  - Twitter Money by @CJ-Johnson17th   All different, all a lot of fun to go through.
  I purchased 4 info products in 2020.  They all paid me back at least 10x.   Great info products are like books without the filler.
  @IndieHackers I‚Äôm actually learning more about Indie Hackers.
  @chrisbits92 Not anytime soon given my following but let‚Äôs wait a year. I‚Äôm bullish.
  @andreasjonssonn 2nd guy to mention that. Need to look it up. Sounds like me and this Pomodoro guy might‚Äôve gotten along.
  @UltraAnshul Often, I‚Äôll read a chapter of a book or chat with my wife or go for a short walk.
  @atxnetsfan @YanceySanderson  https://t.co/4ITUuk2NVw
  @bruce-beaumont @michaelwolber I block mondays and fridays both.  The appointment times can vary slightly so that I can best serve my customers but I‚Äôm usually pretty darn close to 1030 to 230.
  @tyleramarcus That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm focusing on. No phone, no Twitter or social. Just 60 flat then break.
  @jeffignacio @TheJonFedor They mimic the structure but not the intensity because they are ‚Äúworking 8 hour days‚Äù.   I think we would see an increase in intensity by focusing on shorter work days with emphasis on better sprints.
  @emiliadanzica I‚Äôve tried but find that I can cruise pretty well for 60. Will keep experimenting though.
  @AshleighatWork @jeffbajorek Three accounts I enjoy are @uxblake, @brandonthezhang and @AlexLlullTW
  @jadesai94 Exactly. Work really hard but time box that effort. Then relax, think, exercise, etc...
  @KevinEkmark I think so too.   If I were building a company, I think this would be worth a try.   Pay 100% OTE for 50% of the time spend. Hire top talent.
  @michaelwolber It‚Äôs booked inside the time blocks which has worked really well.
  @devantelj Will definitely share. Thanks!
  @LenaSesardic I will. Will give you some updates as I go.
  @BGroat It‚Äôs an average. I feel like I can be more productive but my goal in 2021 is to sprint more and work less from a time perspective.
  Most people are productive only 3 hours per day.  So I'm time-boxing my work from 10:30a to 2:30p.  ‚Ä¢ 60-minute sprint ‚Üí 30-minute break ‚Ä¢ 60-minute sprint ‚Üí 30-minute break ‚Ä¢ 60-minute sprint   Leaves plenty of time to exercise &amp; think.  Let‚Äôs see how this experiment goes.
  @JamesBerges1 This is a really cool thread. Gonna dive in. Thanks for sharing!
  @learnactrepeat It's so true. An exhilarating experience.
  @rstone57 I feel like a lot of people must feel this way...
  @sevendaymvp and form more solid relationships.
  @YanceySanderson Really good idea. Love that.   Going to manicure my feed this year.
  @michaelwolber Exactly. Start small here and grow over time. Should be a good journey.
  @YanceySanderson I've got a really large following on LinkedIn, but not so much here.   When I follow accounts with 100k and they post 20x a day, it can feel deflating.  Following smaller, growing accounts has been really fun.
  An interesting Twitter observation:  Following extremely popular accounts is great, but their quantity and engagement prompt FOMO for me.  Following accounts on your growth trajectory can feel more empowering.   Like you're growing together, not playing catch up...
  @brendanjshort You got it last year!
  2021 off to a pretty darn good start for this Buckeye.   G‚Äônight.  https://t.co/8Q9h0DErH9
