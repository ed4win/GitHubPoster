| @ActiveCampaign Yep.  Get the people part right and the rest comes with it. |

| @APompliano This is great.  2020 was a fun year for distribution, but  siloed to one channel. Excited to start a bigger, longer journey in  2021.  This insight is excellent and a  nice hit to keep me going.  Also, up  25% on BTC in 20 days. Thanks! |
| @JanelSGM @thisiskp_ @randomlysampled  @anthilemoon Congrats, Janel! Well deserved. Cheers to your accomplishments. |
| @MikethePBM @imbayodele The opposite is  true. Algorithms (social media) change  constantly.  The way humans select  tribes and make decisions has stayed relatively constant for centuries. |
| @jeremydstubson Same here. Much more  applicable everywhere else in life. |
| @jackbutcher Vanguard sends me and my  wife each an enormous packet once per day for two weeks if I change my  profile phone number. |
| @kokasexton And the great part is, they  don't change all that much over centuries.   What was true in early Dale Carnegie books holds mostly true today. |
| @quinnemmett Everyone trying to  hack/guess the algorithm. Just learn how people operate and you'll be better  off. |
| Stop studying algorithms and start  studying people.         |
| @ThatChristinaG Yep - it's a class  called "Parents".  Some have  great teachers. Others? Not so much. |

| @tami__mcqueen Thanks, Tami. Looking fwd  to seeing more of you on here in 2021 per your recent tweet. Happy Holiday. |
| @JuiceboxCA I find people use that  phrase as a passive aggressive way to say they don't believe in some of what  was said.  It's most commonly followed  by, "...but..."  I'd rather  hear, "I don't agree with all of what you said and here's why" |
| @ThisIsParsons Yeah, I think it might,  but definitely agree with action.   People spend so much time saying "it can't be done!" instead  of just trying to see if it can be.   Feels like a mindset issue. Probably both. |
| @ThisIsParsons Often I find that the  difference between those who grow and those who don't is simply optimism vs.  pessimism. |
| @ThatChristinaG @Dmurr68 Right back  atcha. üí™üèª               |
| @Dmurr68 @ThatChristinaG Thanks, man.  Still figuring this one out, but really meeting some great people...Nice work  on your end. Been fun to watch. |
| @Dmurr68 @ThatChristinaG Just started  playing in the game...been fun so far.   https://t.co/vh5FDA6lcm |
| @erikbison Yes...good point, Erik.  Understanding where you are going and why is critical. It will help keep you  motivated during times where it feels like nothing is working. |
| @Ali_Merchant Keep it simple. Focus on  quality of content. Once you have validated interest, you can upscale quality  of production. Just my opinion. |
| @mattladydigital Lots of people talk a  great game. Very few act one. |
| If you say you want to grow but you  don't: - Take any risks - Invest in  yourself - Ask hard questions - Overcome your fears - Learn new perspectives  - Network w/ smart people Then, you  don't really want to grow. You just  want to tell people that you do. |
| @_its_greg Awesome, Greg. Great work.  Keep those ideas flowing. üí° |
| 3. What‚Äôs done? v1 had 5 Parts, 11 Chapters, &amp; 48  different lessons. Realized there was some fluff included.  Showed a few friends, they agreed. v2 has 3 Parts, 7 Chapters, &amp; 23  lessons. Each of the lessons is intended to pack a punch. Lesson - Keep it simple and powerful https://t.co/1bXdWPW8TH |
| Learning:  Stay focused and use minimum viable  technology to get started.  There was  a huge learning curve with Mighty Networks and it cost me so much time.  Also, people care about the content, not  how beautiful it is. I know this from my previous course. |
| 2. I'm overcomplicating it Spent 17 hours this past week finalizing  the agenda and getting some lessons completed. Then, screwed up.  Switched from Google Slides to Mighty  Networks, then back. TON of wasted time.   Shiny object syndrome is always my solopreneur Kryptonite. |
| What I learned this week: 1. Consistency is eerie Knew LinkedIn would be my #1 channel but  was surprised by consistency of the results WoW. The % of total uniques to course page from  LI deviated by &lt; 5%, and ratio of uniques to preorders was ~exactly  the same. Eerily so.   https://t.co/0h8rhOBy78 |

| @thealibilawal Exactly. I don't  understand the mentality of hoarding your best stuff. Share freely and  openly. People will still want to buy what you're building. |
| Building online? Here's what works: - Work toward achieving something -  Document the whole journey - Write about your progress - Tie it into a  product - Share What doesn't  work? - Worrying about  "expertise" - Not sharing your journey - Never starting |

| You beat a competitor every day that you  stay in the game. Be the last person  standing. |
| @tonystark2020s Even better, put 99% of  sales books back on the shelf. Go  study people and psychology. |
| @uxblake At least I know what it's  supposed to be. I can just use my  imagination. |
| @uxblake I think it looks really good.  Niche'd down a bit. Your Presubscribe  page has a broken image though.   https://t.co/To2WjFbM24 |
| @HMoosavian @jess_archives It's true.  Learning to persuade and sell opens up a world of possibilities. |
| @BGroat Such a powerful lever. Learn to be incredibly persuasive and you  can do nearly anything. |

| @fbourdeau @KaranNL I‚Äôm just thinking  about comments I get on content.   People work so hard to tell why something can‚Äôt be done.  I‚Äôm all about why it can. |
| @KaranNL @fbourdeau It's a growth  mindset vs. a stagnant mindset. |
| @fbourdeau It‚Äôs amazing how many people  spend their time pointedly breaking down why something can‚Äôt be accomplished. |

| @thealibilawal Yep. When you fail  publicly or admit your failures in public it causes accelerated  learning.  People come to you. They  help. It‚Äôs a very supportive community. |
| Publicly admitting your mistakes is  uncomfortable. But, it's a helluva  personal growth shortcut. |
| Everyone is looking for a shortcut, so  the short game is fierce. Playing the  long game is significantly less crowded. |

| @KaranNL Thanks so much for your  incredible support, Karan. I appreciate it so much. |
| Outside of that, the course launch is  going well. Now it's time to get down to business. A special shout out to @jackbutcher whom I  had the pleasure of grabbing some coffee with. His Build Once, Sell Twice  course was a massive help. Kudos. |
| - A friend pointed out this very thread  doesn't talk much about the course contents until you get deep into the  thread. I could have done a better job.   - I didn't set up Google Analytics properly so I don't have great  tracking. Smh. |

| UPDATE: It took 5 hours &amp; 58  minutes, but I just met my Day 1 presale goal of $10k The outpouring of support from the LinkedIn  &amp; Twitter community has been overwhelming. There are a lot of kind  hearts out there. Here are some things  that went well and some things that didn't‚Üì |

| @AlexLlullTW Love this. I write content  to myself basically. |
| @kenfitzg Hmm. Should have come directly  from Gumroad. Want to shoot me your  email address to justinwelsh@hey.com ?   I'll make sure I received it on my end, Ken. |
| @TommyTahoe Here we go, Tom! Looking fwd  to going on the journey together. |

| @bausbrooks_ Amazing. So happy to have  you on board, Brandon. Appreciate your support. üôèüèª |
| @Ali_Merchant @thepatwalls Amazing, Ali.  Thank you for your support. I appreciate it so much. Excited for this next  journey. |
| @jasonvana Amazing, Jason. Thank you for  your support. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. |
| But, ultimately, I landed on a digital  course.  If you want to follow along,  come join me.   https://t.co/GOmWBLygMj I'm  going to build it right here in public and will be continuously adding to  this thread. Thanks for following along. |
| I kicked around a bunch of ideas from  opening a paid community, to doing cohort-based coaching workshops, to  writing a newsletter. In the end, I decided to go with a digital course  that‚Äôs short and doesn't contain a lot of fluff. Just principles and tactics. |
| 3. I don‚Äôt see much tactical advice for  establishing your idea, growing your audience, and making sales online.  And I certainly don‚Äôt see anyone making  this kind of information affordable. |
| 2. Unfortunately, most of what I see  online are ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù schemes with guys sitting on rented private  planes trying to convince you to spend $1,500. It's ridiculous. |
| I decided to build this for 3  reasons: 1. 2020 has wreaked havoc on  people‚Äôs lives. Millions of people have lost jobs, and having a second stream  of income is more critical than ever. |
| I never really promoted my first course.  Still made $78k. Helped 1,500  people! So, I've really wanted to  create a 2nd one. It's called:  Idea.Audience.Proof.Product. It's everything I learned about planning  and building online in 27 months, distilled down into one course. |
| That was 15 months ago. Here are the  results of building my own thing online:   - Audience: 70,000 (mostly LinkedIn) - Newsletter: 45,000 - Revenue:  $667,884 - Revenue streams: 3 (advising, coaching, digital product) Advising: $430k Coaching: $160k Product:  $78k |
| I spent those 12 months building an  audience on social media (mostly LinkedIn).   Once I had built some interest online and had some prospects asking  about some advisory work, I decided to step away from my role. |
| Quick backstory: I was an executive at a startup in LA that  I had helped build from $0 to $30M in ARR in 3 years. In 2018, I started to  burn out. So, I put a 12-month plan in  place to leave my executive role in September of 2018. |
| Inspired by @thepatwalls, I'm taking  action. I'm creating my 2nd course  over the next 30 days. Instead of  building in private, I'll document the entire process here. Actual revenue numbers, effort, wins,  &amp; mistakes. The course: https://t.co/GOmWBLygMj Follow along üëáüèª |
| @YanceySanderson True story.                                 |
| Anyone who is naturally risk-averse  should have a side hustle.  Or two. |
| @BGroat That's really interesting,  thanks, Brian. It's a world I'm not well versed in.  Considering picking up some BTC. Any  thoughts? |
| @thepatwalls @Ali_Merchant Started as a  member at StarterStory, then saw your course launch in public. Inspired me to  do the same (again).  Thanks for the  motivation üí™üèª |
| @Ali_Merchant Was inspired by  @thepatwalls timeboxing and building a course in public.  I did it last year, just needed to be  reminded to take action. |
| After tinkering around with an idea for  months, I decided to just take some action.   Accomplished more in 2 focused hours than in 30 days of  wondering.  Reminder to self: Just.  Get. Started. |
| @jasonfried Makes sense. Appreciate it.                      |
| @jasonfried Awesome. Can‚Äôt wait to get  my business email on this.  Any  intention to build in templates in the future? |
| @connorcirillo @aarcunning Really cool.  I‚Äôll have to check this out. Thanks for sharing. |
| @kyledackerman @erikbison Thanks,  fellas. I think Twitter is all about deeper relationships which, for me,  means more interesting partnerships, work, friends, etc.  I love LinkedIn. I've met wonderful people  and stood my business up on the platform. But, |
| @AlexLlullTW Here's hoping! Thanks for  all of your great content. Been really excellent to observe how people create  value here. |
| @uxblake @fbourdeau @LinkedIn Well,  shit. That makes me feel good. |
| @fbourdeau @uxblake @LinkedIn Thanks,  fellas. Trying my damndest. |
| @NickB2005 @uxblake Glad it's helpful,  Nick.  All in all, the takeaway is to  create stuff that is interesting and to be consistent. Much like most  platforms, ya know? |
| @uxblake You know what you're doing,  man. Your Tweets, websites, products.  All are very well crafted. Really impressed. |
| It was the first time I had very  meaningful engagement (for me): -  36,333 impressions - 1,200+ engagements.   I didn‚Äôt even think the Tweet was very good. Anyways, thought these could be helpful  lessons for anyone looking to grow and enjoy this platform. Cheers. https://t.co/Ryf3stLRle |
| Then, I read a Tweet by  @AlexLlullTW that reminded me to  repurpose content from other channels that had performed well. I took a popular LinkedIn post, reformatted  it for Twitter, and posted it yesterday.   https://t.co/OKFRfCYoae |
| Next, I started crafting my own content  that I thought was either: -  Interesting - Informative - Entertaining - Helpful Some were duds. Many got better engagement than I thought. |
| Then, I started observing other people  that had smaller followings (under 10kish) but have great engagement.  I simply observed. What made their content  good? A perfect example is  @uxblake He does a great job putting  tweets together and engaging his audience. |
| I started by being an active participant  in more conversations here. This is a  BIG difference between the two platforms.   LinkedIn: Post + sit back Twitter: Post + engage in deeper, more  meaningful conversations. |
| I grew my audience on LinkedIn to over  63k followers. Then I tried Twitter.  It‚Äôs definitely more difficult. But  recently, I got some traction. Here  are 4 things that helped ‚¨áÔ∏è   https://t.co/pn3g694kWD |
| @MikethePBM That's what I'm hoping we  get to. Would be nice to see businesses built by more part-timers with  specific skills i.e. I help with distribution at 4 companies simultaneously,  all underneath my own brand while the other employees are all doing t |
| The present: - Get a job. - Work their schedule. - Make  a major impact. - Take home 10% to 15% of that. The future:   - Create your job. - Work your own schedule. - Make a major impact. -  Take home 100% of that. |
| @jadesai94 Definitely. Motivators, IMO,  are successful at motivating. Hence, I believe they fit the definition.  Success is very subjective and I didn't necessarily mean monetary success. |
| @aadtshth Definitely. With friends, IMO,  it's about leveling up while also finding those who suck energy away and  pulling away. |
| @edward_gorbis @APompliano There's a lot  out there for all of us. Most people  consume and never consistently execute.   The abundance only reaches you when you take action. |
| @fbourdeau The ease is on the backend  when your life becomes easier, though. |
| I've never met a successful person  surrounded by unsuccessful people.   Audit your environment. |

| @MikethePBM It's hard to stop  consuming.  But that 57th blog post  doesn't have the secret answer... |
| @Ali_Merchant @MCellarsOhio I've found  that having a redirect i.e. "I can't do that, but here's a page where I  share information about that topic" has been helpful for me as well. |
| @ethanbeute Reading on the internet to  learn can (sometimes) be a terrible idea, especially if it's a topic rife  with SEO-driven listicles and other nonsense.   I've found creating unlocks learning much faster. |
| @Ali_Merchant It's a skill I work on  every single day. It has been the most meaningful improvement I've made. |
| 3 skills that lead to a more intentional  life: - Saying "no" politely  but firmly. - Embracing difficult conversations. - Using creation to learn  vs. consumption. All 3 have no ceiling  for improvement. |

| @uxblake Oh, Christ. Mine too. It's  nuts. Twitter still feels like an  exclusive club to some people (which, by the way, can be a good thing). LinkedIn feels safe. A place meant to try  and do business (hence the DMs). If  you can curate both effectively, |
| @uxblake I agree, but I think you're  potentially overlooking some basic differences between the platforms that  lead to that ratio. |

| @_its_greg Same here. Have a north  star.  This has been helpful to me... |
| @bruce_beaumont I don't, no. I did the "hustle" thing for a  long time, and I'm really glad I did, to be honest.  It taught me how to work hard, but also  taught me the value of balance as I grew older. I think the hustle culture is behind us  now. It's n |
| @cjkmccaffrey No equity. Just cash for  me.  As someone who makes his living  this way I prefer cash, especially given I have a lot of equity in previous,  still growing companies. |

| Shiny object syndrome is solopreneur  kryptonite.            |
| @andrewkkirk My gut is that top  companies of the future will: - hire  incredible talent from around the world   - use tech and tools to communicate and manage effectively - give incredible autonomy to those they  hire Thoughts? |
| @andrewkkirk Do you mean managing  salespeople?              |
| @LukeWilliams712 Same here.  Given the average person only does about 4  hours of real work per day... Why not  make it the best 4 hours? |
| Woke up at 4am and did a 5-hour work  sprint. Now I'm done for the day. Feels like non-timezone-dependent work  should always operate this way.   What's the downside? |
| @bruce_beaumont @thealibilawal Was wide  awake at 4am today. Leveraged that to work hard for 5 hours.  Now off the rest of the day. Schedule ebbs  and flows which I enjoy. |
| @bruce_beaumont Great question. I am a  one-man show. I delegate using Fiverr.  For example, I'm building a newsletter and I couldn't figure out how to code  @Ghost so rather than spend time figuring it out, I paid a guy $10 and he did  it perfectly. |

| @tyleramarcus It's been such a winner  for me. I've also: 1. Used Zapier to automate my entire  onboarding flow. 2. Automated LinkedIn  DM ==&gt; Email ==&gt; landing pages. |
| @jasonvana I don't, but I only charge  $99. Small enough for any founder to pay but large enough to keep random  people from booking.  I'm testing a  new flow where I allow anyone to book but approve/decline after reviewing.  You can see that here:  https:/ |
| @shanta_adhi Sure thing, Shanta.                             |

| @thescottleese I built a brand new flow  that's gorgeous. 1. Away message on  LinkedIn that directs to email 2. Away message on email that directs to paid  consults Zero access. |
| @meccalauren If it feels wrong, it  likely is. Trust your gut. |
| @jasonvana It's probably the #1 lesson  I've learned.  Second best is #4 |
| 4 hard lessons from 15 months of  self-employment: - If you're unsure,  say no - Eliminate / automate / delegate - Share results in public ‚Üí gain  attention - Chase short-term $ and you'll miss long-term $$$ |

| @BreakItStruan @mkobach I think so. Figuring out the best way to do that is the  challenging part.  As Matt has  suggested here, it needs to start with education from an early level. |
| @BreakItStruan @mkobach Might be  misreading what I meant there. Both  statements could be baseless or accurate. The substance behind them makes  them so. For example, if you hear  "many people are saying it" it could be true if, in fact, many  people are. I |

| @jasonvana Same here. I meet many amazing people who believe they  have nothing to sell.  They explain  their competency and it‚Äôs mind-blowing to me. |
| Everything that you think is  "obvious" is worth money to someone else. |
| @dvassallo Thanks, Daniel. I haven't used iCal much, so I'll just need  to familiarize myself. Appreciate that. |
| @bcorcoran @dvassallo @dhh That's  helpful, Brendan. I hadn't considered using that.  Will look into setting that up today.  Thanks. |
| @dhh @dvassallo That's a very fair  point. To be clear, I prefer HEY to  Google in nearly every way, shape, and form.   The calendar would be the nail in the coffin for my usage of all  things Google. And I'd welcome that.   Looking forward to watching the |

| @gaetano_nyc @IFTTT I‚Äôve actually found  some pretty cool use cases recently. Tied my outdoor cams to inside lights so  if someone walks into my front yard at night the dining room lights come on  inside. |

| @BTrautschold Damn. I couldn‚Äôt build  this well in Sim City. |

| @thescottleese I‚Äôd get a zero with my  salty attitude.       |
| @thescottleese They nailed that  personality part though!    |
| @MiaKiraki I write for very specific  reasons, namely to grow my business.   I've always stayed motivated by watching engagement grow and through  strong qualitative feedback.  Be  intentional, consistent and patient. |
| @BGroat Mostly LinkedIn, some public  blog, some private writing. |
| @tlob A Tweet doesn't (for me - just my  personal take). Usually, I write  between 800 - 1,300 characters, but I don't have a hard and fast rule. I just  want to publish something I'm proud of, adds value, and help my audience each  day. |
| @BGroat I don't have a word target. My  goal is just to publish anything (longer than a Tweet)...when I'm feeling  creative, I might write two or three things. When I'm not, I'll push out  one.  It's a good muscle to build. |
| @thealibilawal Thanks, Ali. I appreciate  that. How often are you writing? |
| I committed to writing daily 18 months  ago. Here are my results: ‚Üí 82.4%  adherence ‚Üí 445 unique content pieces ‚Üí 40,000+ new social followers Not 100%, but what an amazing journey. I believe learning to write is a gift to  yourself. |

| @brendanjshort This was all around my  convo with you. Led me down a really interesting path.  I thought it was "serendipity"  per our text. Not sure now. Feels more  like effort + curiosity. |
| @kyleplacy @thescottleese @AvenueTP  @morganjingram @TomBoccard Thanks, Kyle. I'm just a guy who hires smarter,  more talented people to make me look good :)   I feel the same way about you for marketing. Cheers. |

| @harryhurst I‚Äôm watching companies make  the decision to base pay on the employees geography.  I just cannot fathom that decision. Glad to see you‚Äôre making a different (and  better) call. |

| @thescottleese @thealibilawal Agreed.  What do you think is the most important thing to be consistent with? |

| @LandonAinge @SDinwiddie_25 @ArianFoster  I agree. I've been kicking this idea around for a while now and modeling out  how it would best work (caveat: I'm an operator by nature, not an  investor).  I've spent the last two  years investing in myself and the |

| @LandonAinge @SDinwiddie_25 @ArianFoster  Reading this article re: @SDinwiddie_25 . Was not at all familiar with his  decision. Need to dig deeper to fully understand this concept. Reading about  Fantex and @ArianFoster now. Thanks  for sharing. |
| @tami__mcqueen Appreciate you right  back. Cheers, Tami.     |
| @LandonAinge @SDinwiddie_25 @ArianFoster  I'm not familiar with the approach of "tokenizing future earnings",  but I'm digging into some articles now. Thanks for sharing. |
| @tami__mcqueen Sure, didn't want to  hijack your thread, but here ya go:   https://t.co/UEZrtDy0sH |
| @tami__mcqueen Just wrote on LinkedIn  about this today. Consistency + patience... |
| @JayRevell @mkobach This should be  excellent. Thanks for sharing. |
| All I want to do is invest in  people.  Not companies. Just  individual people.  I've come across  so many unique and interesting folks with incredible ideas. I think a small  check + some guidance would be all they need to get rolling. |
| @thescottleese Seems like we're synced  this week :)         |
| People confuse income &amp;  wealth. Income is what your paychecks  say. Wealth is your situation if that  paycheck stopped. |
| @DomSutton_NZ For the love of god,  unteach them.            |
| @agazdecki Had a blast interviewing you.  What an incredible story you have, Andrew. |
| @markymetry Hustle 24/7 is a sham.  There will definitely be times in your  entrepreneurial life when it's required to work a long day, but it cannot be  constant. Rest makes a better  entrepreneur. |

| @the1truederek @cvonhuene Bingo. That's  a great one, Derek. |
| @thescottleese @cvonhuene Basically,  what Scott said. Either build a relationship or pay. I give some pro-bono  time to those who invest time in building a relationship with me. When people I do not know at all, just  reach out and say, "Can I get 30 minut |

| @BridgetWesson Ain‚Äôt it though?  Surprised it‚Äôs still so uncommon. |

| @BlueHairdDodo It's just more blatant  every day. Sickening. |
| @stevenbroudy 100%. Always. Part of my  early success was being onboarded with incredible salespeople. Pushed me out  of my comfort zone and created intense competition. |

| @Josh_G_Roth They have their place and  time for sure, my man. Hope all is well with you. |
| @jasonvana That's basically my process  as well. I might add a little flair to make it interesting, but it's just the  problems I'm solving. |
| @dvassallo Yep. I think I'm almost free  from the grip. COVID likely accelerated a bit. May have taken me two years  rather than one to unlearn the previous 15. Thanks for the reply. |
| @dvassallo After 12 months of creating  my own lifestyle, a big challenge has been unlearning my previous work/life  cadence. Did this take you a while as well, Daniel? |
| @garrytan Wow. This hit. Perfect timing  and an incredibly well crafted message. |
| @knownikkiivey Thank you, Nikki :)                           |

| @thescottleese @SalesRebellion I read a  Dave Gerhardt post that said "go for base hits, not home runs".  That resonated with me.  So, I just  post each morning and don't think about the algorithm much anymore. |

| @harryhurst @Patticus It's a really  great question. You've eliminated the obvious answers that come to mind, so  product adoption was one...I'll give this some additional thought and pop  back in. |
| @harryhurst @Patticus To me, there are  two:  1. Potential improved product  adoption through a large financial obligation. 2. Canceling talks become infrequent. With  monthly, I always assume customers are observing performance on a  month-to-month basis v |

| @thescottleese Just? I was at Bingo  before he got elected.  |
| @mikeyebio Well, shit, man. Thank you!  Glad to hear you're killing it. |
| @schlaf This is the question that leads  me to saying "no" most often. A true gem. |

| @madebyblack He finally said something  true!                |
| @TheJackieHermes @thescottleese KD gets  a lot of this. He would def participate. |
| @TheJackieHermes @thescottleese I'm  down.                   |
| @Josh_G_Roth Haha. Chris Holtz isn't his  real name. He even took the time to make a fake Gmail. I know who it is but  just don't care enough. |
| @SchneiderKJ Definitely. Lots of great  people and meaningful conversations. These wackos just stick out a bit more. |
| @Its_Jenn_Here @thescottleese  @TheJackieHermes You'd probably cry. |
| @thescottleese üòÇ                                             |
| @thescottleese @TheJackieHermes This is  exactly what I want to do. We should make that happen. Kinda like what Jason  Bay with those small-clip videos recently on LI. |
| @KevinEkmark Based on the writing style  they definitely have bigger problems. |
| @TheJackieHermes I know! I have a  calendar item this weekend to reach out to you. This move has been brutal  during COVID. You will definitely be hearing from me. I don't know that I  have your email address. Will you DM it to me? |
| @shawnkwekinc I think this is hate-lite  compared to some stuff I see. |
| @TheJackieHermes Me neither. I sat there  just scratching my head. I'm considering making it my new banner image. :) |
| @jasonvana This was in response to  sharing a positive story. People are losing their damn minds. |
| @SportsBoyTony I'll bet you get this  100x worse on Twitter. |
| @DerekShebby @paulsalamanca It was.                          |
| @paulsalamanca I'm just blocking now. I  had some guy tell me I was a "piece of shit" and "ugly"  today. Really weird given I just shared a nice story...I'm not putting up  with it anymore. Just blocking. |
| @Josh_G_Roth @MatthewGattozzi Thanks  man! That's how I intended for it to come across. Great feedback. |
| @jasonvana @MatthewGattozzi Develop  away! We all have goodness to share. |
| @MatthewGattozzi Awesome! Glad your  enjoying it. Cheers.    |
| @scottbsales Love this. Implemeting  today.                  |
| @schlaf The better you are, the luckier  you get.            |
| @stephenrose1010 If you have a plan and  you're evaluating it, you're the doubters worst nightmare. A motivated,  curious person. |
| Ignore doubters.  Doubt is projection. Someone else's insecurity pushed on  you. Create your plan. Work it. Be  consistent. Be patient. |
| @jeffbajorek Definitely. I can do  anything for 5 hours but want to make sure I‚Äôm focused on the right thing  without leaping at other options. Therein lies the challenge. |
| @kylesareus This is super helpful.  Thanks, Kyle!            |
| @lilmac024 My struggle is when I think  about a podcast I start creating. Logo, website, guests, etc. I get excited  and start creating stuff. I‚Äôm worried any deviation will result in a rabbit  hole experience. |
| @BGroat @jasonvana I love that. Thanks,  Brian. Appreciate it. |
| @jasonvana I‚Äôm building out a new  business and I‚Äôm creating a content plan and I get it all completed.... ...Then...   ‚ÄúOooh! What about a podcast?!‚Äù   Down the rabbit hole I go. |
| @mrpatrickmc I don‚Äôt think there is  anything wrong with consumption. I consume all of the time. Was more focused  on encouraging people to create. Consume, then create. You learn so much more  from creation (IMO) |
| @stephenrose1010 Thanks, man!                                |
| People work 40 years for 10 companies  only to be replaced in 2 seconds.   Break free from the trap. Start  your own business. |
| @scottbsales Even if there isn‚Äôt an  objective truth, it will be to formulate opinions based on multiple sources. |
| Stop bragging to everyone that you read  25 books a year. Publish one. Stop  telling everyone about the podcasts you listen to. Record one. Stop spouting off everything you read in  blogs. Write one. There's no reward  for the most consumption. Creation?   That's a different story. |
| @DerekShebby @heyhey Yes. It‚Äôs one  challenge I‚Äôm facing.    |
| @HarryStebbings @20vcFund Congrats,  @HarryStebbings. Excited to follow along. Cheers. |
| @jasonvana @scottbsales Don't do it!                         |
| @scottbsales Next 3-5 months... (coming to you from Nashville) |
| @gaetano_nyc What a GREAT read. Very  well put together. I've got some green in there, but have put my health in  "red" to get those others to green. Hate that. This is good  motivation to change. |
| @ADT sending unmasked salespeople to my  door at 7pm to sell home security systems.   Bold. |
| @rogerdickey So stupidly good. I‚Äôm a  Mayura on Venice Blvd. in Culver City, guy. |
| @gaetano_nyc If I could give you any  advice (unsolicited) it would be this: your early 30s business energy is  something tough to replicate. Use it to its full capacity, wisely, each day.  Happy bday. |

| @Josh_G_Roth @AvenueTP Good sales is  better than this. Bad sales is much, much, much worse. |
| @SchadenJake @thetakeout @BTParsons  Awesome. Really intrigued by this world...thanks for sharing. |

| @dwilliamriggs That's right.  Ignore the arguing. Ignore the folks  driving us apart. Instead...build. |

| @IMaddalozzo @heyhey I have. I really  enjoyed Superhuman, but ultimately HEY gives me more control over my inbox.  It keeps it super clean, rather than having to constantly triage. |
| @DerekShebby @jasonvana @heyhey Yes.  Multiple gmail accounts are being forwarded. |
| @DerekShebby @jasonvana @heyhey Yes. One  issue has been that since your email address will likely be similar when you  reply, it sometimes triggers a phishing warning. Other than that, no issues. |
| @rockyclark1 @heyhey Yep. All of my  gmail right now.        |
| @jasonvana @heyhey The more you use it,  the more valuable it becomes, IMO. I've screened out so much junk and now my  inbox is just important email. That's it.   If I want to read marketing newsletters, I can scroll them like  Twitter. Brilliant. |
| @heyhey Sure thing. Thanks for the  awesome (and affordable) product. Cheers. |
| @HighTailTom @heyhey IMO, it's valuable  for anyone who has a crammed inbox. I've gotten rid of all of the noise and  junk that floats in... |
| My inbox is mine again. In my first week using @heyhey, I've gone  from hundreds of emails per day to just 10-15 important ones.  I feel like I've gained control over my  email. What a win. |
| @JALyles @shahedkader I always  try... To me, interaction is a must.  It's tough to interact effectively when you lose that highest level of  engagement...(the present) |

| @AdamMGrant @pqblair I feel the same way  about certifications for many roles. Some are prohibitive because of cost.  They keep folks locked out.  Imagine  if LeBron James would have had to get "certified" to play  basketball &amp; spend thousands of dollars |

| @ladyfromdalou This was absolutely  joyful to watch.         |
| @gaetano_nyc @ohpinion8ted Had a great  time doing some debating... |
| @SVMansuri @thescottleese You let your  managers, directors, and ICs dictate how you hire departmental leaders? And  how they get compensated?  That's a  recipe for disaster. |
| @SVMansuri @thescottleese Sahil - I‚Äôm  curious how you might approach a situation where you have two options: - a stretch VP comfortable with 4yr/1yr - a  proven VP who wants milestone vesting allowing acceleration in 3 years by  hitting stretch targets. |
| @dwilliamriggs I feel the same way about  pods. If you must manufacture engagement then you're not doing something  right. It's also optimizing for the  wrong outcome. It's not about engagement.   It's about end results. |

| @ZadrazilRyan Oh, 100%. I think people  don't start because they don't know how...It's not as hard as one might  think. Just follow the steps. |
| Want to start a side hustle?  Here's what works: - Work toward achieving something -  Document the whole journey - Write about your progress - Tie it into a  course/book - Share w/ your audience   What doesn't? - Worrying about  "expertise" - Not sharing the journey - Not starting |
| @CJ_Johnson17th Have a plan. Get  started. Be consistent. Age not  required. |
| @CJ_Johnson17th Stocks are on sale right  now. I'm buying.   |
| Building a personal brand isn't about  expertise. Just get started learning  something you truly are interested in.   Then: - Document the process -  Aggregate your learnings - Share your wins &amp; losses w/ others People want to follow your journey.  That's what it's all about. |
| @morganjingram @thescottleese  @pereusfrance @Josh_G_Roth @scottbsales I‚Äôm hustling to move cross-platform. |
| @ohpinion8ted @jeffbajorek I think we‚Äôre  saying something similar. Content creates fans but I believe lead magnets  tend to attempt to shortcut that process. Download. BANG. 15 emails over 15  days. Forget that. I‚Äôd rather read one tweet per day for 15 days |
| Growing wealth is about getting  creative. Every time you make a $1,  ask yourself: "Where can I put  this dollar to make another dollar?"   Things like: - Real estate -  side project - stock market - learning a skill - Getting coached Not like:   - shoes - clothes - video games |
| @BurkeWriter @yoast @HubSpot @danmartell  I can appreciate that. It's not how I buy, so I tend to follow the path that  I, myself, would be influenced by. So...no more magnets and email nurtures. |

| @CJ_Johnson17th I just took the $2,500 I  made from @gumroad, passed it to my wife, she invested it via @etrade and  doubled it in 48 hours.  Money making  money. |
| @ramit @Jonherrington You can buy as  many $3 lattes as you want if you pay yourself first...Love this. |
| @jeffbajorek @ohpinion8ted I understand  intent and I understand that not everyone who downloads a lead magnet will  convert into a sale...just like each cold call. IMO, the lead magnet to email funnel will  only get worse over time as buyers get funnel fat |
| @BurkeWriter Have you ever been nurtured  via email to a purchase? |
| @gaetano_nyc @gaetano_nyc to add  context, I've scrapped reading the books &amp; following best  practices. I've started to recreate  the buyer's journey I've followed to purchase products.  It's been eye-opening. I'd love to learn  what's working for you a |
| @gaetano_nyc Branding + credibility is  focused on eventually turning prospects into customers though, no?  I just haven't made my way through a  funnel or to a purchase by starting with a magnet.  On the flip side, I'll buy ANYTHING some  people put out. |
| @jbplat Thanks, Jim! When I take a step  back and think about how I purchase things...it just becomes so obvious what  the catalyst is.  I buy info products  like I buy albums. I become a fan and wait for the release... Email nurtures? Nah. |
| Lead magnets don't work.  I've downloaded 500+ ebooks, whitepapers,  case studies, &amp; infographics.   Never bought a thing.  I've purchased  2 things online and they were from people I followed for months and loved  their content. Build fans. Not email  campaigns. |
| @simmons_m Thanks, Mike! Learning a ton  every day and just trying to put it all out there. |
| Making money is NOT about your  product.  It's about your  audience.  Stop building that website.  Put down the online course software. Pick up a copywriting book &amp;  learn to tell compelling stories.   Stories ==&gt; Audience ==&gt; product |
| @supriya_85 @Gumroad for selling  products and @Etrade for stocks... |
| Wealth creation cycle: - Make money at your job. - Invest in your  side hustle. - Make more money with that money. Starting 2 months ago, I've deposited every  dime from my side hustle into dividend-paying stocks.  That money is making more money. The cycle continues. https://t.co/T1P7AhE9UC |
| @allisonbraley THAT is funny.                                |
| I love hiring people with side  hustles. Don't focus on the  distraction you envision. Focus on the motivation built into that  person.  You want that. Trust me. |
| @thescottleese @Daniela_Boricua  Connected with her. Thanks for the recommendation, Scott. |
| @cvonhuene Thanks, Chris. It's much more  digestible when you break it down this way. |
| @elriclegloire Don't use in copy of  post. Significant decrease. I can't track comments vs CTA but anecdotally,  the CTA seems to have driven more. |
| Motivation in sales. How much is natural, and how much can be  built? I dove into that and more on the Modern Sales Podcast. Check it out here:  https://t.co/nVOMe8PcAB https://t.co/ZOnBNi3t8b |
| @paulsalamanca Thanks, Paul. Have you  been experimenting with the featured section CTA yet? |
| @magnusbilawal Thanks, Ali. It's been a  lot of fun to experiment with the feature. Have you been using it at all? |
| The new LinkedIn CTA drives  revenue.  Takeaways: - With good reach, it's pretty easy to  drive sales. - Posts are worth ab 4.3 sales @ $50 ACV - Live broadcasts  convert ab 4.7% of attendees.  Daily  posting + 1/wk live broadcasts should produce bt $1,500 &amp; $2,000 in  revenue. https://t.co/I3uhPuX7JJ |

| @M_Gagliano @amarjoshi112 Lots of  experiments with LinkedIn CTA. Some experiments with Twitter. Always trying  to understand conversion rates. |
| @M_Gagliano @contraocoronga @gumroad  From 2,500 to 35,000 was about 14 months. |
| My personal network is amazing.  From finding my friends jobs, to working  together on content, to simply supporting the heck out of each other... Wow. I‚Äôm lucky and speechless. |

| @amarjoshi112 Far from the revenue we  want as a family, but we each are consultants making a full-time income. This  money? Easy way to bring retirement closer.   Just had a $1,000 week experimenting. Ya know? |
| I've been thinking about 6-figure info  products w/ my wife: - $50 product - 3  daily sales - $300 total rev between 2 people   $109,500 in revenue. Much  easier when you break it down like that. |
| @simmons_m Thanks, Mike. I appreciate  that!                 |
| @jasonvana 100%. They don't think  through a strategy...     |
| 3 reasons why personal branding gets  sh*t on: 1. It can come off as  self-serving even though the net impact is massively in favor of others. 2. It makes people uncomfortable to see you  promoting. Discomfort spawns anger.   3. It's hard and people don't like to see you succeed. |

| @ErnestLehti @gumroad Awesome, glad you  picked it up, Ernest. |
| @SchneiderKJ You can definitely do that,  but (maybe unfortunately?) polarizing works. Everything that we click on or  interact with tends to provoke SOME emotion. Polarizing doesn't necessarily  mean agree/disagree. |

| You‚Äôre personal branding wrong.  You can‚Äôt be middle of the road. Lame.  Boring.  You can‚Äôt be crazy. Saying  stuff that doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Be  polarizing. 65/35  agreement/disagreement.  Maybe 60/40. |

| Don't focus your personal brand on  "viral content". Instead:  what's a problem you know how to solve?   Create content for that. If the advice is sound. If it's authentic. Virality will come.  Be consistent. Be patient. Chip away.  Incremental growth. Tortoise vs. Hare |

| If you‚Äôre brand building, make it about  yourself, not the company you work for.   Lots of people spend years building for their prospects.  Then, suddenly they lose their job.  Building your brand for you means you can  take it with you wherever you go. |

| I‚Äôm so damn COVID ready with  ‚Å¶@MargerumWine Bring it on. https://t.co/cct6JxTLV5 |
| @jasonlk 15+ here. Keeping our customers  happy but also understanding the messaging, talk tracks, etc. that are  resonating right now. Using that to better speak to prospects. |
| @TheOutvoted @Crypto_Blurbs @C4liCrypto  @kenklippenstein Significantly more. But that‚Äôs my choice my man. |
| @TheOutvoted @Crypto_Blurbs @C4liCrypto  @kenklippenstein They STILL get skewered. Bill Gates has spent his whole life  dedicated to philanthropy and gets crushed because he has money. I‚Äôm just  tired of all of the blaming. Let‚Äôs put an end to it. |
| @TheOutvoted @Crypto_Blurbs @C4liCrypto  @kenklippenstein I‚Äôm not ignoring the question. If I had 55 billion dollars  (liquid - which I don‚Äôt and neither does he) I‚Äôd give away WAY more. I‚Äôm  philanthropic by nature. But just because I would doesn‚Äôt mean tha |
| @TheOutvoted @Crypto_Blurbs @C4liCrypto  @kenklippenstein Its literally the WHOLE factor. You can‚Äôt give away what you  don‚Äôt have liquid access to. Zuck is rich but he doesn‚Äôt owe anyone his  money. None of us do. I don‚Äôt love the guy but I don‚Äôt hate this |
| @Crypto_Blurbs @TheOutvoted @C4liCrypto  @kenklippenstein Of course they are, but why let facts get in the way of a  good shitting on success? |
| @TheOutvoted @C4liCrypto  @kenklippenstein Imagine living in a system where you could exchange nearly  anything...hard work, ideas, execution, etc. for currency. But...ya know..Sit  around on Twitter and judge people giving their money to charity. |
| @kenklippenstein You should be ashamed  for this overly simplistic view of someone's net worth. You know better than  this. Irresponsible. |
| @TheOutvoted @C4liCrypto  @kenklippenstein *billion          |
| @TheOutvoted @C4liCrypto  @kenklippenstein He doesn't have 55 billion dollars. His net worth is 55  million dollars. You understand the difference right? |
| @peterpham https://t.co/cXpabttosf                           |
| @IsaiahAscher Definitely.  Which...again...just really surprising. I find it to be so easy, but the fact  that so many others don't means there is opportunity there for some company. |
| @IsaiahAscher My friends are like,  "this is really confusing, can we just use facetime?". Really  surprising. |
| @IsaiahAscher Just like...my buddies and  parents. If they don't use Zoom for their business they actually have a  really hard time with it. To me, that's an interesting takeaway given how  easy I think it is. |
| @IsaiahAscher I'm not talking about  companies. I'm talking about friends and family outside of the tech  community. It's like I'm asking them to write code. |
| One really interesting learning during  this time is how few of my non-tech friends use or understand Zoom.  For as simple as it is, somehow, they  don't get it.  Seems like a major  opportunity to me. |

| @dgoldy216 When you‚Äôve got opp creation  and velocity (time to close) you got a pretty decent grasp on what‚Äôs going  on. Once you close more deals I‚Äôd focus on what the bigger deals look and act  like. Then narrow in on ICP opp creation by rep. |
| @dgoldy216 And Since revenue is  important but you‚Äôre sorta guessing, I‚Äôd add opp creation by rep or team. |
| @dgoldy216 Cool. I don‚Äôt know if I care  that much about close rate because the denominator (opportunities) is more  important. Closing 1 for 2 at 50% isn‚Äôt as compelling as 4 for 10 at 40% ya  know? |

| @luigimallardo That's a good thought.  Barcelona is out (simply because I've been there recently - I love it) so  Lisbon was high on my list. Italy could be a great time, but I've always felt  like it deserves like 2 weeks, no? |
| @PhilGuesty @saastr Haha. Love me some  warm, brown beer (I actually am a fan of real ale). Have you been to Lisbon  yet? |
| @bcnorange @saastr I love Barcelona, but  been there recently. Went to London about 10 years ago, but haven't been  back. Never been to Lisbon. Is it that you love London, or just don't favor  Lisbon? Or both? Curious. |
| @cvonhuene @saastr Any thoughts on the  best neighborhood to stay in? |
| @shuggilippo @saastr Ooh. ‚ÄúThorough  country report‚Äù. Tell me more! What did you love? I‚Äôm really excited and  Lisbon is def where I‚Äôm going. |
| @evvie85 @saastr Gracias.                                    |
| @samfjacobs @saastr If it‚Äôs trying hard  at food and drink, I‚Äôll forgive it. |
| @jmj @typesfast The setting that blasts  reps theme music when they close a deal is epic. Our office was a mixture of  Nipsey Hussle, Bon Jovi and Madonna. Chaos, but fun. @AmbitionSales is great. |
| @Josh_G_Roth I'm super jazzed to hear  about it, man!        |
| @farnoushouts Thank you so much,  Farnoush. Cheers.          |
| @cdorsey04 @saastr Any recs on  neighborhoods?               |
| @evvie85 @saastr Yo! What's up, Evan?  Have you been? Where should I stay? |
| @farnoushouts I haven't been to London  in a decade and I loved it the first time. What's a really hip part of the  city to stay in for good craft beer/wine/foodie experiences? |
| @Josh_G_Roth @collincadmus @saastr My  parents are headed to Split soon. Waiting to hear back on what they think,  but it's on my 2021 list! |
| @collincadmus @saastr Was considering  Italy but have this notion it requires like 2-3 weeks. Lisbon seems like a  city I can do in 6 days (maybe I'm wrong though) |
| @thescottleese @saastr Awesome. Lots of  votes for Lisbon!   |
| @saastr @thescottleese Definitely, but  have been recently. Never been to Lisbon and haven‚Äôt been to London in over a  decade. Looking forward to seeing y‚Äôall in Paris. |
| @jcmrgo @saastr I‚Äôve got 5 or 6 days.  Lisbon seems (obviously) way cheaper. I just don‚Äôt know a whole lot about it.  People seem to love it though. |
| So many salespeople leave their roles  today for an extra $10,000 in salary. They do it without thinking about the  stuff that actually matters: company, team, culture, product, equity, comp  plan, responsibility, career pathing...   Don't be that salesperson. |
| Headed to @saastr Europa this June in  Paris.  Planning an after trip...two  choices: 1. #London 2. #Lisbon My wife and I are foodies and drinkies.  Would love to hear thoughts from people who have been there. |
| @gaetano_nyc @SchneiderKJ Man, same  here!                   |
| @SchneiderKJ This is a really good tip,  thanks, Keith. It's still a bit new for me, but this is super helpful. |
