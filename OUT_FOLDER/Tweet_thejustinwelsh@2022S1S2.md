@austinbelcak Shining the light on what you're learning helps attract other people who are doing the same.  Once that network grows, it's really, really difficult to fail.
@aaditsh Share the information you wish you had on your journey 2-3 years ago.
@hari_luker Thank you!
@heychazza @dickiebush I have them staggered over time.
@anthonyserino_ Comment valuable things underneath large accounts.
@Jim_Keenan Haha. Thank you, man.
@Nicolascole77 Thank you, my man. I appreciate the love.
@persuadingcopy None of those things.
@austinbelcak Good call :)
@hiimanshu19x  https://t.co/JElqOQ5D08
@iamemmaoconnell Kajabi! And thanks.
If you're struggling to produce written content:  - Start writing your piece - Take a break for 30 - Come back - Cut 30% - Edit it - Post  Process, not perfection.
@dickiebush This is every Monday from 10:15a until 3p for me.   I create:  - 1 newsletter - 1 Twitter thread - 5 LinkedIn posts - 5 Tweets - 5 Instagram posts - 1 LinkedIn carousel - 1 Instagram story  Work week complete.
@growthcurrency @AlexLlullTW Looking fwd to reading it, Dylan!
@alexaom6_ Right when I started it.
@Yannick_Veys This is awesome, man. Thanks for featuring me.  Been loving @hypefury so much. Keep the features comin'!
@theactionpod Yep - it will go down as you grow (probably!) but I've heard anything over 45% is good. So nice work!
@EvergreenMEP Thank you so much, Greg. Get after it, man!
@adityatheverma I appreciate that, Adi.
@copywithkush Thanks, Kushagra!
@KarlKaufmanADI I appreciate that, Karl!
@blakeaburge Thank you, kind sir. Too nice!
@that_niyi Appreciate that!
@MantaisMoney Just to be clear, be clear.
@copynishantraj Thank you, Nishant!
@kylepdotco Thank you, Kyle!
My newsletter has a ~62% open rate.  At 31k+ subscribers, that seems good.  Here are 4 simple tips I learned publishing for 25 weeks:  1. Clearly define who it's for 2. Clearly define what they'll get 3. Clearly define when they'll get it 4. And keep it short! (less than 5 min.)
@Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Benjamin Buttons stuff here.   You both look 17.   Making it difficult on us 40 year olds. Please start aging.
@heyflus Nailed it.
@EmailAssets That's exactly it, Pedro.
@IAmAnasAmrani I like that.
@Mostpopul Good call.
@nkornel For sure.
@CheetSheets Too many people think I have the answers, when I am, in fact, not their customer.
Struggling as a solopreneur?  Don't: Focus on technology Do: Focus on customer problems  Don't: Build a coaching business or course Do: Build an audience around one topic  Don't: Ask popular social media accounts what to do Do: Ask your prospective customers what to do
@aaditsh The #1 thing I see that stops people is "knowledge blindness".  They are blind to the valuable knowledge they have because they believe everyone else knows what they know.  They don't.  Share what you learn on your journey and those behind you wi
@heyeaslo Learning to write + scalable systems = incredible consistency.  And with consistency comes growth. Congrats, man.
@EvergreenMEP Appreciate making the team.  I got cut from Varsity basketball, so this is long overdue.
@SahilBloom For sure.   But even those building paths outside of audience, community, and distribution still reap massive rewards via exposure - agree?
@gregisenberg Ha. Trying. Glad to hear it's resonating.
@Nicolascole77 I often hear "Most Blog posts should be Tweets."  This is a perfect example. You captured nearly everything needed to start a business in 2022 in less than 280 characters.  Good on ya.
@thedankoe How to send 1,000 salespeople into the ecosystem while you do deep work:   - Log on to social media - Post something helpful - Log off

@agazdecki Damn dude. Do you ever stop shipping? I love it.
@NinaGreimel For sure, Nina!
@KevinAlexander Nice, Kevin!
@shalom_luke Absolutely, Luke.
@timothyjacque I might :)
@juancolamendy Absolutely, Juan Carlos.
@ChrisRocas SO early in the game.
@artkulak Agreed, Art. That's it right there.
@JyotishreeDatt1 Very smart.
@riam2016 For sure.
@SimplyTom Get started, Tom :)
@copy_papi Keep going, Phil!
@bikerbhutani Nothing is easier done than said.
The smartest people I know are building leverage by focusing nearly 100% on audience, community, and distribution in 2022.

@thedavescience No shade on coders!   I would love to code. I just don't know how and don't want anyone to think of that as a limiting factor.

@SahilBloom We all believe that people know what we know.  A terrible assumption.
@Nicolascole77 Thank you, my man! I've learned a ton from you about writing. Win/Win.

@thedankoe Appreciate that, my man. Thank you!

@brendan_aronson @sparktoro Welcome!
@CheetSheets 100%. Everyone has this fallacy.  It's about remembering that your knowledge is valuable to those who don't have it.
@jessekoepkecuts @sparktoro Love that, Jesse!
@blakeaburge Everyone is guessing.  The best people guess, analyze, iterate and repeat.
@vrsceo Thank you!
@joshsube Love it! That's the way to go.
@lfreiredev Thanks so much, man!
@itsedaxe Absolutely. But in the beginning, I didn't use much. Now I do!
@sparktoro @stripe @gumroad Get started.   ↑ That's the KEY.  Make your first move today and start working this process.  If this was helpful, feel free to RT or give me a follow.  If you want tips like this every week,  join 31,007 subscribers in my week

3/ Find the "you" from 2-3 years ago  Your goal is to find people who are just like you, but much earlier in their journey.  Where do they hang out online? Try places like:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - FB Groups  If you can't find them, use tools like @sparktoro to help.
2/ Identify your interests  Inside of the list you just created, will be things you loved doing &amp; hated doing.  Sorry, but you can't scale being miserable.  Choose something you built skills in, that you also enjoy doing/talking about/writing about.  This will be your focus.
1/ Eliminate the "fallacy of expertise"  When you get started, don't worry about "am I an expert?"  If you do, you'll never get started.  Instead, make a list of your accomplishments, big and small, over the last 2-3 years.  What skills did you learn during this period?
I've now built 2 of my 5 income streams past 7-figures.  1. My coaching business 2. My digital products business  And I never wrote a single line of code.  Use these 10 dead-simple steps to do the same (without all of the mistakes):  🧵
@AlexLlullTW Excellent thread, Alex. Thanks for including me. Just bookmarked this!
@heyeaslo Add copywriting and marketing and then use all of these tools to automate your new content engine. Powerful!
@jacob_cardy This is awesome. Thanks, Jacob!
@luqmanshantal You rock, man. Thank you!
@cjgustafson222 @HarrisFanaroff Haha. That's amazing timing.
@Nicolascole77 Damn.   Haven't bookmarked something this fast in a while. Nice encapsulation of timeless writing techniques. Will revisit later.  Thanks, Cole.
@girdley @AdamSinger Haha 😂
@thedankoe People love to hate selling without realizing that every action they take is because they've been sold.
@CheetSheets Same thing here...
@artkulak That's exactly it, Art.
@SeanPHogue For sure. But going viral is rarely the way to do that.
@sarvamwriter Thanks, Sarvam.
@bbourque For sure. But it's worth it.
@imjoshcousins Great thread, Josh. Thanks for the shout!
@NoCodeCreative @blackmagic_so
@JustinWise @OneJKMolina Both smart sayings...

@writes_eve If people laugh at me for joining a conversation, then they probably aren't people I want to spend time interacting with.
@Zbijelic 100%, Zlatko.
@HenryMental Exactly. It's not even hard. It's just fun.
Carve out 15-20 minutes per day to reply to people.  - Easy exposure - More profile clicks - Better relationships  173,500 impressions in one week.  The time:impact ratio makes this a no-brainer.  https://t.co/EZ8VELAdKB
@thedankoe Every good thing looks like a scam to those who don't spend the time to understand it.
@Prateek03883386 Definitely.  Everything is rigged.  The question is just, "Ok...now what?"
@heyeaslo @mariepoulin @AliAbdaal Wow. So honored to know this, Easlo. Greatly appreciate it, my man.  Keep going. You have the brightest future...
@calebmkeller Almost entirely organic.

@Edwindoit Absolutely.
@CheetSheets @iamwillcannon Just bookmarked this to read later. Thanks!
@artkulak For sure, Art.
@KateBour Same.  I've never formed a solid relationship because someone has cold DM'ed me all of their life questions without an established relationship.
@Piyushscopy For sure. But, if you're going to make the ask, follow these rules.
Networking 101  When you reach out to busy people, assume you are 1 of 1,000+ people asking for their time.  - Differentiate yourself. - Make your ask mutually beneficial. - Make it really, really easy to say yes.  Do these 3 things and you'll network more productively.
@dklineii Thank you so much, man! Much appreciated 💪
@mike_frederick @dickiebush @googleanalytics Thanks, Michael!
@dickiebush One of mine as well. The first 7 years of my career I blamed my failures on everyone but myself.
@thedankoe I love that.  I'm an optimist by nature, so this is just how I think.   "This can definitely be solved. I don't know how yet, but it can be."
@dickiebush It's why "quality over quantity" is a phrase the needs more context.  In the beginning, it's all about quantity. Put a lot of stuff out and then hone in on what worked.   Do more of that and quality becomes inevitable.
@thedankoe They are much more likely to tell you that you cannot achieve things (because they haven't).
@jasonstrimpel For sure! We all have self-doubt.  It's just remembering that we're gonna make it.
@blairmacgregor That's for sure true, Blair.
@hastakshar For sure, Shweta.
@copyforcreators @galjudo Glad to see you shifted!
@ItsKieranDrew I do this as well. I have a mantra I say each morning. Feels weird, but also seems to work.
@Steven_Nelemans The optimist talking
@heyeaslo Nailed it, Easlo.
@CheetSheets Accountability is key. It's the best way to grow internally, and therefore externally.
@BuzzRobTaylor That's exactly it, Rob. It can be hard, but oh so worth it.
@EncoreAfrica True story.
@The_Klapz_Guy I love it, Satya.
@artkulak I agree. Optimists rule the world.
@SeanPHogue For sure, Sean. I love that.
@chrisrickard I love this, Chris.
@Piyushscopy It really is.
@hey_dhruv That's spot on, Dhruv.
@StoicSelf That's how I feel.
@MahimaJalan2 Always, Mahima.
@itsedaxe 100%, Ed.
Every successful person I know believes in themself.  Every unsuccessful person I know believes everything is rigged.  It's cliché as hell, but mindset matters.
@MentalWeapons Glad you enjoyed the issue, Max!
Your mindset changes when you make $1 online.  Anything becomes possible. But how do you start?  Yesterday, 30,127 people learned the strategy and tactics.  Miss the issue?  Grab it below ↓   https://t.co/2MgaN9ft9X
@CooperKraussKC Thank you, Cooper!
@compoundthat It definitely is. I love that.
@sohaibgadiwala That's exactly it, Sohaib.
@MichaelJNovotny That generally comes from having too few customer/prospect conversations.
@JarvisKa I've done it for sure.
@Jamesbrackiniv Great question to ask yourself, James.
@YongYuYY Yet so often skipped.
@sunilc_ For sure, Sunil.
@ManjhunathRavi Correct. And they often get it wrong.
@agazdecki 100%, man. This is what led to both of my info products so far.
@3PillarsParent We just have to validate that people will pay for them.
@artkulak Yes, I should have probably put solution in quotes
@Steven_Nelemans That's where the money is!
@Emilio_emb It's also an endeavor based on being very close to, and speaking frequently with, your customer. Which so many people skip.
@TMitrosilis For sure. Only really painful problems get you paid.
Many solopreneurs building a solution don't even understand the problem.
@blakeaburge My wife and I do our weekly finance meeting each Saturday morning in Excel, so this was really timely.  Appreciate these, man.
@brendan_aronson Shield Analytics.
@IAmPatyRubio Processes and systems
@IAmClintMurphy Excellent thread, Clint. Thanks for the kind feature, my man!
@BenjaminPutano Excellent thread, Ben!
@dickiebush Love this quote.  Every Monday, I coincidentally am inspired to write my entire newsletter.  Every Tuesday? 10 piece of content.  Weird, huh?
@Nicolascole77 Damn.  That's absolutely prolific output, Cole.  Congrats.
@thedankoe This is spot on.   Always be up-skilling, because in the blink of an eye, you realize you're less relevant than you used to be.
@agazdecki Then hire people who understand their specialty deeply and let them do their thing, all while holding them accountable to the agreed upon KPIs.
@dvassallo Feel better, Daniel. Get well soon!
@Jayyanginspires Thank you so much, Jay. See you tomorrow, man.
@slakhyani76 I greatly appreciate that.
@thegoldsuite I greatly appreciate that. You're well on your way. Just keep going!
@5harath Thank you so much, Sharath.
@thedankoe Thank you, my man. Means a lot. Looking fwd to connecting today.
@OvieDuke Can't wait to ship it, Duke.

@AuthorOnTheSide Was a great time, Hassan!
@adammarx13 @DianaVilic @ericasmyname @imdanabowling @PhilipLakin @lukematthws @NoDegreeDotCom @JAY4HOPE Thanks, Adam!
@chrisrickard That's my goal, Chris!
After tinkering around with an idea for months, I decided to just take some action.   Accomplished more in 2 focused hours than in 30 days of wondering.   Reminder to self: Just. Get. Started.
@thedankoe Becoming auto-didactic is a cheat code for life.
@aaditsh And copy. Learn to write in a way that people can easily digest and enjoy.  That's rocket fuel.
@agazdecki One of these things is not like the other...
@heyeaslo Congrats, Easlo!
@writingtoriches Nearly everything in school is about memorization and regurgitation.  Nearly everything in the real-world is about problem solving.  It's why most Valedictorians are no more successful than the rest of their classmates.
@dickiebush Great thread, man.  The best tip I got from you was write and edit at different times.  I started by doing both at once, and my long-form has improved significantly with that advice.
@thedankoe So true, man.   Your content is a huge army going out 1 by 1 and capturing attention, luck, and interest every day.   Start building it and add to it daily.
@TMitrosilis Maybe it is ;-)
@ManjhunathRavi Good stuff, Manjhunath!
@ItsKieranDrew I love that approach, Kieran.
@agazdecki Many people start building a solution to a problem they don't even understand yet.  You're nailing it here, Andrew.
@bhallcpa That's a good one, Brandon.
@SachinRamje Many build solutions before they even understand the problem.
@FlorianMielke Love this, Florian.
@CheetSheets That's exactly it.
@chrisrickard Yep.  Most MVPs can be a landing page and Calendly or Stripe.
@stanrym I agree that's one powerful way.
@BrianFOConnor I see a lot of people buying up hundreds of dollars worth of monthly tech and they haven't made $1 yet.
@iamsimm0 I'm putting something together at the moment to share what I've been doing. Works extremely, extremely well, IMO.
@YanisRenaud It depends. #4 is big for so many people I talk to.   But I definitely see all 4.
Solopreneurs generally struggle with 1 of 4 challenges:  - They don’t fully understand customer's problems - They don’t capture interested prospects - They overcomplicate the technology - They have no online audience  Review these and create a simple plan for each.
@DenisJeliazkov @MilaChervenkova Thank you both!

@CooperKraussKC I'd say find a company that allows you to use your personal social media 😀  Then, build out a brand that gives you leverage so you never find yourself in that position again.
@jappleby @amandanat I think this will be in addition to threads. Looks like a great way to build more trust by showing deep expertise without leaving the platform.  Sort of moving to an all-in-one publishing tool.
@pupeno I agree. I think it's ridiculous. That's why I would never work for a company with an agreement like that.  Build some leverage and you have the same optionality.
@yekeen_ayodele I think that's true.
@InTake_Anthony That last line is basically what I was trying to convey. You did a better job.
@pupeno Sure, but many of these (not all) prohibit competitive side projects.  For those that have more iron-clad legal docs, it could be much toughee.
@ericasmyname It's not easy. But it's possible.  It's just a matter of priorities and some people (rightly so) have different priorities which I completely respect.
@hey_dhruv I think so too, Dhrv.
@JesseGerniginAC 100%. This is the easiest, IMO.
@_baillee For sure. Most great things aren't very easy. It's about balance and not feeling urgency, but taking it one step at a time.
Even if you’re employed full-time you can still:  - Consult - Freelance - Write eBooks - Create video courses - Write a paid newsletter - Do cohort-based coaching  The barrier to entry has never been lower.  The potential to replace your salary has never been higher.
@creation247 So many people think it's about the dollar when it's really about the mindset shift.
@dvassallo I read this as I was looking at my fitness habit tracker. Just ruined my morning 😂
@dickiebush Keep it going:   - 5 observations during that time - 5 things people get wrong about solving it - 5 ways solving this will change in the future - 5 tools or techniques that made solving it easy
@Nicolascole77 Thank you for saying this.  The most common questions I get are:   - What time? - What tech? - How many?  None of it matters if you don't understand who you are serving, why you are serving them, and what you're helping them do.
@austinbelcak The best way to be interesting online is to be interesting offline.
@agazdecki This translates to almost anything we do, which is why it's so important.  If everything you create is only for yourself, you miss an incredible opportunity to help others.  That's how you build a brand, audience, business, etc.
@thedankoe That's right.   It's like trying to viral.   It's basically meaningless unless your message is hitting your exact ICP.
@CheetSheets Yep! A huge confidence booster in every way.
@matt_gray_ I appreciate that man ❤️
@matt_gray_ Great thread, Matt! Thanks for the shoutout :)
@blairmacgregor It absolutely is. You're right, Blair.
@FCKlas Exactly. Great advice, Christian.
@polak_jasper Aim big, start small.
@hritikrajdm Nailed it.
@coachgmuncy I sold a course for $50 in 2019 based on what I had learned writing online.
@HiSanchoman Get that first dollar and $1B doesn't seem all that crazy ;-)
@heywarco That's exactly it. I made $50 in 2019. I was hooked.
@tomberryCD You can't make $1M if you can't make $1.
@CheetSheets And it's just the beginning. It's a mindset shift, and it makes every other dollar easier.
@_The_Silk_Road That's right. The key to success right there.
@Billionaire_CL It's a marathon.
@ThePupOfWallSt A marathon is made of many steps.
@aIIegoricaI I love that sentiment.
@ryanbozarth_ Just getting started is the best thing you can do. Then analyze, iterate, and try again.
@hey_dhruv That's exactly it, Dhruv. Start small, learn to compound over time.
@abhishekshah173 I'm still working on my systems to continue to grow slowly and intelligently.
An observation about solopreneurs on Twitter:  Many struggle to make $1 online because they are focused on how to make $1M online.  Making $1 will change the way you think.  Start small, not grandiose.
@KateBour External, internal, relationships, debates, negotiations.   Lots and lots of marketing.   It’s why the skill set is so powerful.
@dbustac @OscarLagrosen Thank you fellas!
@dickiebush  https://t.co/H6O7LzWlqu   It’s the playbook every Twitter power user has bought to come over and explode on LinkedIn.
@_anthonydisney Thanks for the kind shout, Anthony!
@tylersmith_io Why we have the world we do today.
@zolfagariMD Of course. That should go without saying.  I don't put up with any of that stuff.
@JoshFromCMG True story, Joshua.
@artkulak Absolutely, Art.
@Matt_Throne I understand that for sure. It's generally true that most points of view have some merit (not all)
@abhishekshah173 Same. Just listen and empathize.
@CalvertKyam Thanks, Kyam.
@eitan_levy101 For sure. It's a great skill to have.
@_baillee Would improve the entire world.
One of the clearest signs of intelligence is being interested in other people’s perspectives.   95% of people I meet aren’t.   Crazy.
@Nicolascole77 Super interesting. I need to dive deeper into this, Cole.  Anyone doing a good job of this?
@AugustBradley @blakeaburge @Julian @SahilBloom @dickiebush Thank you so much!
@coachgmuncy That's so true, Gabby.
@claudio_fray Of the total pop? No, I don't.
@agazdecki I can also validate that it's one helluva book.  Congrats on all of your success, Andrew.
@heyeaslo Anyone who is building a one-person business oughtta be subscribing to this.   Congrats on the launch, Easlo.
@writingtoriches These are all very smart, very simple (not easy) changes that lead to a 4x increase.  Cool part?  You can choose to make 4x more, or work 25% as much for the same amount.  Optionality.
@Coach_Riad_ Ha. Figured someone would catch that.
@Nicolascole77 The most powerful!
@kennysmithnanic Thanks for the kind mention, Kenny 🔥
@CheetSheets For sure!
@andyfieb Keep talking about the same topic until you attract people who also want to talk about it.
@ReturnToEmail Or share your thoughts via Twitter. Both excellent ways.
@Chimzzar1 But others probably do.
@TimdNerd For sure, Tim.
@Lively_Amit Here's a guide on choosing something to say:  https://t.co/TwgI63yXsp
@MarketerHayden Thanks, Hayden.
@BusinessEngines It's crazy to ignore the potential, IMO.
@ManjhunathRavi For sure!
@chrisrickard That's unfortunately true, I think, Chris.
@Shaynmtl Learn to consume from the best, and create using what you've learned.  Winner.
@ChaseArbeiter You're everywhere, Chase!
@copyforcreators This a great comment. I love it.
@_Wisdom_Academy Haha. Easy.
@theficouple Nice!
@rachanashinde_ Keep going, Rachana.
The internet is like a convention where anyone can speak.  1% of people grab the mic, 9% of people actively listen, and 90% of people mill around talking shit about those on stage.  But, the stage is where business happens.  So, grab the mic and start talking.

@AlexAndBooks_ Damn, these are good. Saved.
@thisiskp_ Smart!
@realjondavids That sounds awesome!
@AlexAndBooks_ The funniest thing is I think mine could have been 100x better in this thread. I'll re-release in 6 months with a new hook :)

@dickiebush Sounds like a damn interesting read 👀
@SahilBloom That's awesome man. ❤️

@thatroblennon That's an amazing story, Rob. Wow. Love it.
@thatroblennon That's awesome advice, Rob. I love that.
@Stories2Sales Appreciate it, Jon!
@BahWad Thanks for reading!
@matt_gray_ @Nicolascole77 We'll see. I hope!
@Nicolascole77 Too kind, my man. Thank you!
@giannicara Thanks so much, Gianni. Glad it resonated.
@franchisewolf Very true!
@blakeaburge I'm pretty sure too. 😉
@SahilBloom  https://t.co/TvI8HhYKl7
@parker_solowey Then Tweet and thread about your expertise regularly, until it isn't small anymore.
@Zbijelic @thatroblennon Thanks so much for giving it a read, Zlatko.
@_areebpasha Nice!
@WrittenMastery Awesome!

TL;DR  Step 1: Avoid the top 4 killer thread mistakes Step 2: Write the body using headers and white space Step 3: Use a specific call to action to tell readers what to do. Step 4: Write compelling hook lines by using my recommendations.
Example 4: Get right to the point   https://t.co/6XEyJhLLQR
Example 3: Use juxtaposition (comparison)   https://t.co/0Q73LPwI00
Example 2: Use eye-catching numbers   https://t.co/ajS4ODrlb7
Example 1: Tell people what they'll get &amp; address an objection   https://t.co/yylDFpE9Co
5/ Crafting a great "hook" Tweet  The most critically important step of writing Tweet threads is the "Hook" Tweet.  This is the first Tweet in your thread, and it makes or breaks your entire thread.  I've found there are 4 ways to open a killer Thread.  Here they are ↓
4/ Add a great CTA  People write threads &amp; then forget to tell the reader what to do.  What a waste!  Here are some example CTA's:  - Follow you - Buy your product - Join your newsletter - Sign up for a live event - Read another thread you wrote  Check out this one from me:  https://t.co/j0jk0ghwVc
3/ Use headers and white space  A header simply tells the reader what to expect in each Tweet they are reading.  White space is the space between lines so that it's easier on the eyes.  Don't use too much whitespace, but just enough to make it easy.  Here's an example of both:  https://t.co/DZnt0VqrXj
2/ Start by writing the body  The body of the thread is the information you're attempting to convey.  It should add very specific value:  - Teach something step-by-step - Tell an interesting story - Share a framework - Dispel a myth  Stay away from nebulous observations.
1/ Avoid thread mistakes  Here are the most common mistakes I see w/ threads:  - Lacking a good Hook Tweet - No headers on the body Tweets - Way too wordy, and no white space for reading - No clear call-to-action or call-to-conversation at the end  Here's how to fix these ↓
Here's what you'll learn by reading this:  1. Avoiding the biggest thread mistakes 2. How to write a great thread body 3. Using headers and white space 4. Writing a great CTA for the end 5. Establishing your "hook Tweet" 6. 3 killer openers  Let's dive in ↓
How to write a top 1% Twitter thread:  🧵
@dickiebush Hard to lose with this routine...
@Nicolascole77 Understand why people make the decisions that they make, and you're already a better marketer than 90% of people.
@SahilBloom My therapist recommends that each morning you work yourself to exhaustion.  So, this morning, I'm going to go swim. I hate swimming. Let's see if this works.
@thedankoe I needed to hear this today.  Time to hide and reemerge with some new stuff.
@adammarx13 @SahilBloom Beautiful, Adam!
@BuzzRobTaylor Same, Rob.
@thedankoe This is so true.   1. Figure out what you know 2. Figure out who needs to know it 3. Figure out how to find them 4. Figure out how to distribute 5. Say your price and be quiet
@CheetSheets For sure. It's like you forget that you didn't know this stuff once...
@jakevictor_ They almost never do.
@adalbueno That's the truth, Adal.
@igorbenic Love that, Igor.
@blairmacgregor That's right.  If it helps one person, it likely will help 100.
@navdeepsoni That's a good idea, Navdeep.
@SahilBloom 100%. Once I realized that my experience and knowledge was worth something to someone else, things started to clear up a bit.
@jasonstrimpel Figuring out what you know that's valuable is that critical first step.  Once you know, it's time to figure out who needs it.
Something you think is obvious is worth $5,000+ to someone else.  Have a great week.
@blktrn8n @thedankoe Appreciate it!
@JumpStartJim Thanks so much, Jim!
@thedankoe I couldn't help it. That thread was fire, man. So helpful for people looking to send better DMs.
@SahilBloom Well done. These are awesome, Sahil. 👏
@austinbelcak Narrative violation 😂
@AlexAndBooks_ I think people forget that they don't have to finish a book they don't enjoy.  Or read an entire book at all.  I often revist certain parts of certain books just to get a refresher.
@writingtoriches Write online daily for 36 months and your entire life will change for the better.
@Delikwu For sure, David.
@mercyosaghai Thanks, Mercy! It came yesterday, so check there.
@theandreboso It almost always is.
@MSpurohit15 Yep.
@giannicara Thanks for giving it a read, Gianni.
@FinlinedFinance That is for sure true.
Your network determines your success on Twitter and largely in business.  The stronger your network, the more likely you are to be successful in any endeavor you choose.  Yesterday, 29,594 subscribers learned how to build deeper online relationships.  ↓   https://t.co/YsAbtW9Zz6

@AlexAndBooks_ @harrydry Welcome!
@bmceuen Sure! Whatever fuels your fire.
@SachinRamje You rock, brother.  Doing things the right way.
@RachelThalmann @hypefury I'm down. LMK @Yannick_Veys
@austinbelcak This is 100% true.  When I used to hire salespeople at PatientPop, I never liked when they applied to be a salesperson, customer success rep, and marketing associate.  Be specific and know what you want.
@thedankoe I have a "Daily Intentions" Notion doc that helps me get these all aligned.  Great stuff, Dan.
@AlexAndBooks_ My favorite article to revisit is this one from @harrydry    https://t.co/YmgFZPq1HS
@agazdecki Haha.  When people ask me what I do, I say: "Social media stuff."  I should probably get an elevator pitch.
@heyeaslo Block the negative.  Consume the positive.  Create to give back to the latter.
@writingtoriches Every piece of content is like a little salesperson out working on your behalf.  The more, the better.
@SachinRamje You got a nice feature in my newsletter today!
@ErinGibbens @KateBour Appreciate that! :)
@matt_gray_ 🔥
@matt_gray_ Great stuff, Matt. Harry’s marketing examples is one of my faves.
@blakeaburge Get after it! Love to see you building this product out.
@ChaseArbeiter Damn right, Chase.
@willcoombe Oh, 100%, Will. I remember mine too. Changes everything.
@cogentgene For sure, Gene. Exactly how I think about it.
@AuthorOnTheSide Oh, 100%. I think it's more imperative right this minute, than ever before.
@theareebirshad I usually carve out an hour and push the ball forward. Then it's enjoyment time.
@Kunal_KumarJ I've found it to be one of the most helpful, for sure.
@_Wisdom_Academy For sure.
It's an amazing feeling every time someone buys something you created online.  Spend a little of this Saturday building towards that.   You'll never regret it.

@bhallcpa Kajabi for everything now.
@Nicolascole77 Create your niche and be open to flexibility.   As you create your category you may find something even more interesting inside/adjacent to it.  Stay nimble.
@thedankoe When you wake up at 430am on Monday morning excited to do work, you know you've found it...
@Codie_Sanchez Lots of people are great at making money.   Growing it is another story. That's why they end up sacrificing their time over and over.  Learn to make and grow your money. That's when it becomes infinitely easier to recapture your time.
@agazdecki The more customers you talk to, the more successful you'll become.  The more successful you become, the more investors will talk to you.  Win/Win.

@LBacaj That's so kind of you to say, and so wonderful to hear, Louie. Thanks, man.

@_anthonydisney Haha. I thought this was serious until I got to the end.
@RajAyoosh Heck yeah! Thanks, man.
@thedavelyman Oh goodness. I hope you're joking.
@thedavelyman It's really the connect and pitches that bother me. I get lots here on Twitter too though.
@jimh4milton Looking forward to sending it, Jim!

@dickiebush The 1% compounding in effect is insane.   I loved that in Atomic Habits. Great thread, man.
@austinbelcak Coming from a sales leadership background, I know most "yes's" come from touch 8-12.
@dickiebush I prefer working on one thing at a time, but many things one after another.   Focus + diversification
@Nicolascole77 If you have talent, build systems.  Systems give you a better shot at consistency.  Nobody likes staring at a blank screen and just hoping...
@agazdecki This was always my goal as CRO 😂
@_ZionSpirit_ I'm not sure. It will depend on how good you get at it, what your offer is, if you listen to your customers, etc.  Lots of chance and luck at play, always.

@sweatystartup Unbelievable.  I came across your site and info long before I ever made a single $ online.  It helped me feel like it was possible. Just thought you should know that.
@personalvipin Appreciate it, Vipin.
@EvergreenMEP Thanks, Greg!
@dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal Well...that's a wrap.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
@dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 15/ Explore how to use community  1. Get feedback 2. Get beta testers 3. Build an affiliate program 4. Get your first testimonials 5. Presell with a great discount 6. Get support for your content  And so on
@dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 14/ Monetize  With a community of fans, monetization becomes a lot easier.  You basically have a "shopping mall". A captive audience.  People are looking to buy and you're the store owner.  No algorithm. No
@dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 13/ Deepen Relationships  Once trust is built, you can build deep relationships.  Create a community to show a "behind-the-scenes" glimpse at how you think, act, &amp; work.  It's easier to invite someone i
@dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 12/ Learn to "deplatform"  I started a newsletter because I wanted to "deplatform" my audience from social media to something I actually own:   An email address.  I've found this is the best way to guard ag
@dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 11/ Leverage How-to videos  Don't like interviewing? Turn the camera around on yourself.  This is a great way to build trust by literally walking people through how to do something.  A master at this is @aliabdaal  Ch
@dvassallo 10/ Start a Podcast  If you don't want to write, start a podcast.  It shows your expertise, and you get the side benefit of connecting w/ interesting people.  Social proof!  Like how @dickiebush &amp; @nicolascole77 do it on the Ship30for30 pod
@dvassallo 9/ Write a newsletter  A newsletter is a great way to show your expertise.  Long-form allows you to go deeper &amp; more tactical in your lessons.  You're literally showing people how your brain works.  I do this weekly in The Saturday Solopren
@dvassallo 8/ Build Trust  Once you get discovered, you must build a deeper level of trust.  Not trust in the traditional sense of the word, but trust in your expertise.  That you actually know what you're doing &amp; can back up what you talk about.  Thi
7/ Learn to add value  All of these pieces of content are intended to "add value" to the reader.  It's a phrase that is used so often, but people rarely understand how to approach it.  But, it's not a mystery.   Here's my favorite way to describe it, from @dvassallo  https://t.co/cjALCCCtzp
6/ Empathize  Some content reaches your audience &amp; says, "I understand what you're going through" or, "you're not alone".   This content draws your audience in closer &amp; greatly humanizes an otherwise inanimate social media profile.  Like this:   https://t.co/gbFgY8RqsL
5/ Challenge people  Content that challenges perceptions should get the reaction:  "I've never thought of it like that before", or... "What an interesting observation" or just... "Damn."  Open people up to a new perspective and win.  Like this Tweet:   https://t.co/vpY4srYOHT
4/ Be entertaining  Teaching is helpful, but if you hammer your audience with teachings 100% of the time, you run the risk of boring them.   If you bore them, you might get tuned out.   This is where entertainment comes in.  Like this Tweet:   https://t.co/W9KpStVnaa
3/ Teach people (educate)  The easiest way to get discovered is by teaching prospective followers &amp; customers how to do something.  These are "tactical" Tweets and threads that show off a bit of your expertise.  Share your knowledge!  Like this:   https://t.co/zRuGfCGl3p
2/ Get Discovered  If nobody finds your thoughts/ideas, nothing else matters.  You want to start by creating value where folks are already consuming.  - Twitter - LinkedIn - TikTok - Etc.  There are 4 ways to do this:  1. Educate 2. Entertain 3. Challenge 4. Empathize
1/ Build a creator funnel  This is a simple journey your audience goes through, increasing the chance they become a customer at each step.  It has 4 key parts:  1. Discovery 2. Trust 3. Relationships 4. Monetization  The first part is getting discovered.
Here's what you'll learn in this thread:  1. Getting discovered 2. Content that works 3. What "adding value" really means 4. Moving from discovery → trust 5. Why "de-platforming" matters 6. The journey to deep relationships 7. Monetizing a captive audience  Let's dive in ↓

@CalvertKyam Thanks, Kyam!
@spontaneousbkpk I don't :)

@TheWizardGal That’s why I love it.
@LBacaj  https://t.co/ytjFf1zdoA
@quote_luke Less than those telling lies.   That’s why I encourage everyone to be skeptical.
@LBacaj I’m loving watching you. Just lurking over here excited by what you’re doing.
@AroojAhmad This is awesome.
@NextToWealth Right?
@spontaneousbkpk I know. I can’t keep trying to bring ‘em down.
@tomberryCD This is 100% the truth, Tom.
@KalimoLeboela This is excellent advice.
@samthescot The cool part is that it still feels like I’m  screwing around.
@JosephSeifert22 Yep. Walk a marathon if you have to.
@acor_mark Same, Mark.
@Samuel4Christ Just keep putting yourself out there, Samuel.   Watch what works. Do more of it.  What what doesn't. Do less of it.  Then, just keep going.
@thedankoe @afunnelguy @The1stReporter Tell me where and when.
@itsjustbri_yt I agree, Bri.  The amount of stuff you learn just doing it on your own...damn. Crazy.
I've worked in executive leadership roles in startups that have raised $300M+ and generated $400M+ in revenue.  But I've never learned more than I'm learning now just screwing around trying to build my own thing on the internet.  Start a side project online.  You won't be sorry.
@fab_rosato This is awesome, Fabio. Great job :)
@giannicara Appreciate that, man!
@SahilBloom For sure.  I try not to hate on anyone's style, but that just isn't mine (the first one).   I'm glad to see progress.
@Nicolascole77 The internet is like a stage that's open to anyone who wants to speak. 1% of people grab the mic, 9% of people actively listen, and 90% of people mill around the bar.
@joshdviner Pretty wild, huh?
@MichaelJNovotny @thedankoe 😂 I'm not even hating on their game. Good for them.  It's not my style, so I'm just glad to see the tide turning, ya know?
@matt_gray_ Great thread, Matt. Thanks for the kind mention, my man. 🔥
@FinlinedFinance Thank you so much!
@MatterCalm That's right!
@kylepdotco True story.
@JosephSeifert22 I think you might be right, Joseph.
@thedankoe The same here, Dan. It's so refreshing to see it moving away from the old way and towards the new way.  I guess that's just the normal shift in anything new.
@baltunt Less and less, I think.
@DougWoodrow I'm so glad. ha.
@theob2brebel I think it will go away, tbh.
@jdchernikoff Trying, Josh!
@TheRealUtaini These are becoming less and less, IMO, though. The internet doesn't take long to catch on to scams.
@EvergreenMEP Haha. Thanks, Greg.

6 objections to handle when selling your product:  1. You don't understand my problem. 2. You don't have the expertise. 3. Does anyone else like this product? 4. Why is it priced this way? 5. How fast will it work? 6. Why should I buy now?  Write landing page copy to overcome.
@JesseGerniginAC Winner 😂
@austinbelcak Logo blindness.
@Codie_Sanchez "I had a similar idea once" - everyone
@agazdecki Trademark that.
@writingtoriches It's generally the inverse.  I use copy I know will generate engagement to continue growing my prospect pool.  When it's time to sell, my posts get 70% less engagement but I make 10x the revenue.  Gotta have a balance. Great Tweet, man.
@Nicolascole77 That's a really great point, Cole.  I hadn't considered that when writing my response. Good call.

@TMitrosilis Appreciate it, Teddy.  Your writing is looking amazing lately, btw. Congrats.  Keep going.
@dvassallo It's a wonderful feeling to be able to shut anything down, start anything new, change something completely, or just do nothing.  And it requires zero explanation or (my least favorite) a lengthy business case.
@dickiebush This is a great list, man.  Stealing for my newsletter subject lines. Appreciate you putting it together.  🔥

@kencrosss Thank you.
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
TL;DR  - Pain - Agitate - Intrigue - Positive future - Solution
6/ Results  This post ended up with:  - 276,798 impressions - 1,646 engagements - 371 comments  And 600+ new subscribers to my newsletter (nice).  Mission accomplished.
5/ Present your solution  The last step is to introduce our solution into the equation.   In this particular instance, the solution was my newsletter, and my intention was to drive subscribers.   You can see that here:  https://t.co/so47VlSxxN
4/ Paint a positive future  Now that we have the audience's attention, I work to paint a picture of what a positive future would look like.  A positive future tied to following the intriguing Creator Funnel.  You can see that here:  https://t.co/nAwoB40V9N
3/ Introduce something intriguing  Next, I introduce something intriguing.  I want the audience to think, "Wait, what's that?"  So in this post, I introduce something called the Creator Funnel.  My goal is to get them to lean in with interest to carry them through the content.  https://t.co/07OIwQlOtt
2/ Agitate the pain  Next, we're going to turn the knife. Make it hurt a bit.  This gets under the reader's skin and makes them...well...agitated.  Once someone is agitated, they are much more likely to be open to a solution.  Here's how I went from problem to agitation:  https://t.co/FxCaGJBTMd
1/ Highlight something painful  The 1st line highlights a painful problem that people in my audience experience:  They feel taken advantage of at work.  This line is intended to do 2 things:  1. Elicit a strong emotional response 2. Get the reader to the next line  Then...  https://t.co/BklEasJxWI
I have an easy trick to solve these problems.  It's my variation of PAS (problem/agitate/solution) called PAIPS.  - Problem - Agitate - Intrigue - Positive Future - Solution  I'll break down a LinkedIn post of mine that had 276k impressions using this format.  Let's go ↓  https://t.co/JZ3Xvu6trG
Because of that, I dreaded writing each day.  I stared at a blank screen, and then sloppily threw together some messy content.  When I finally pressed "post", all of my worries came true.   Nobody read it. Nobody engaged. Nobody cared.  That sucks.
First, If you don't understand human emotion, it's tough to write great copy.  I struggled to write effectively for the first 6 months on social media.  - I didn't have a system - I didn't understand the psychology - I didn't know anything about copywriting
A 5-step formula to 10x your copywriting skills:  🧵
@Chadmgreenlee Great thread, Chad.   So glad you found the course helpful.  Appreciate the kind words 🔥
@natolisnuggets Yep. Always experimenting to see what works. So far, so good.
@levelsio @jt7th Day made.  https://t.co/hpsqblnqwc
@jt7th @levelsio He's somebody I look up to very much.
@Ryanlombardi1 IMO, it's not about "being the best".   Many people spend all of their time on one thing and never succeed, let alone become "the best".  To me, it's more about diversification and risk reduction.  As a solopreneur, I can't afford to have o
@BuzzRobTaylor Yet so often ignored.
@mrdanielamadi That's how I normally approach it, yes.
@igorbenic Love this!
@Emilio_emb Love that additional context, Emilio.
@matt_gray_ That's exactly the plan, Matt.
@Zbijelic 100%, Zlatko. Always been my preferred approach as well. Much more fun, too.
@the_robertallan For sure!
@jonhershman Thanks, Jonathan!
@BBFFMikey Same. That's my whole engine.
@ionalpha_ Once something is up and running, just push it through this funnel:  - Eliminate what isn't necessary - Automate what you can with tech - Outsource lower value tasks to a VA  Then take the extra time and work on something new.
@rehacks_ That's exactly it.
@Shaynmtl Awesome, Shayn.
@AarushiCW Get after it!
@gjsequeira Yep. I meant it that way (wasn't clear though).   Start with one, then stack.
@Piyushscopy Agreed.
Your self-employed income goals are more likely to be achieved with a portfolio strategy.  Think 4-5 smaller income streams.  Provides much greater flexibility and reduced risk when compared to one big bet.
@ItsKieranDrew No specific process as of yet.
@_VersatyleStyle @dickiebush Writing a thread about it this week.
@austinbelcak Love it, man!
@ContentChampion All awesome ideas, Loz.
@sahilkhosla I learned it the hard way too!
@willcoombe @heyeaslo Thank you, Will!
@dickiebush P: Pain A: Agitate I: Intrigue P: Positive future S: Solution  My favorite (slightly tinkered with) copywriting formula. Love it, Dickie.
@Codie_Sanchez If you don't, it's unlikely anyone else will. And it's REAL easy to see...
@agazdecki As a former Chief Revenue Officer, I approve this message.
@heyeaslo Learn the very deep nuances of one platform.   Become an expert there while improving your chosen medium (writing, video, audio).  Then, take your learnings and expand to other platforms.  Exactly what I did as well.
@Darrenmmatthews Systems &gt; attempting to stay inspired.
@chrisrickard Thank you, Chris. Write once, and publish many, many times.
@thedankoe For sure, Dan. Just trying to keep up with guy's like you. 📈
@AlexLlullTW Thanks, my man!
@OscarLagrosen My newsletter on Saturday broke down part of it, but not all of it.
@el_conklin Haha. I guess.
@jasonstrimpel It can be very grueling.
@ImraneSubstack I am.
@_SyedHuq Thanks, Syed. Give it a try.
@coach_avinash Definitely does, Avinash.
@iamsahiljasuja Absolutely, Sahil.
@_anthonydisney Also a great idea.
@matt_gray_ Thanks, Matt!
How to create 17 pieces of content:  - Write a step-by-step newsletter issue - Turn it into a Twitter thread  Then break it into 5 pieces:  - A Story - Observation - Contrarian take - Simple listicle - Analysis  Turn those into:  - 5 Tweets - 5 LinkedIn posts - 5 Instagram posts
@JoshFromCMG Thank you so much!
@agazdecki If someone needs a big team or fancy resources to move the needle, you're looking at someone who generally can't help you early-stage.
@writingtoriches Brilliantly put.
@sweatystartup 100%  - Eliminate that which doesn't move the needle - Automate anything that can be with technology - Outsource lower-value tasks and things you're not good at  Generally, whatever is left over is what you should be doing.
@thedankoe Much appreciated, Dan 🔥
@LeanGeekInvests I'm so glad you enjoyed it, Nick.
@TheAnkurTyagi Much appreciated, Ankur. Thanks for giving it a read.
@jamiesuggartist That's awesome. Congrats!
@BrianFOConnor Nice thread, Brian. Thanks for the mention. 🔥
@TnvMadhav I hope so!
@TMitrosilis Thanks, my man. It's hard at first, but then becomes easier over time.
@iamcryptoyogi Thanks for giving it a read, Hitesh. Appreciate it.
@CSMikeCardona  https://t.co/Lj4zFLmIgn
@SahilBloom Thanks, my man. Appreciated.
@CheetSheets I appreciate that!
@Jayyanginspires Thanks, man!
Each week, I turn 1 idea into endless Twitter content.  Yesterday, 28,597 people learned how in my newsletter. Miss it?  You can find the latest issue here:   https://t.co/x6Rz5vGVEa
@mjwhansen @arvidkahl @KateBour  @AprilynneAlter  @amandanat  @AmandaMGoetz   All dynamite follows.
@brendan_aronson I wrote about it:  https://t.co/frlueDqVqB  This is now a $9,400 MRR business.  https://t.co/srpGAY2SQO
@CoreyWilksPsyD Nice thread, Corey. Thanks for the mention, cheers.
@writes_eve Great stuff, Eve!
@_SyedHuq @HeyJimBurgess Thank you!
@dickiebush Get after it today. ✍️
@SahilBloom An empty calendar is the biggest flex.
@thedankoe The best part about this approach is that problem-solving can become systematic.  Once you learn to solve one problem, you can see the pattern to solving others.  That's when you become really valuable.
@aaditsh I've never met a mediocre person with impostor syndrome.  That always helps me reframe it.
@writingtoriches Haters are also generally angry at themselves, not you.
@barrettjoneill Thank you, man!
@AuthorOnTheSide Write a newsletter then:  - 1 Thread - 1 Instagram post - 1 Instagram story - 5 Tweets - 5 LinkedIn posts
@MelisOnCheddar Thanks, Melissa!
@EvergreenMEP Awesome stuff, Greg. Thanks for including me. Great getting to know you a bit yesterday.  Cheers.
@TnvMadhav Thanks for the feature!
@thedankoe Thank you, sir.
@SachinRamje Yep. Aggregation and a few "secrets".
@AshwinMStanley It comes out in about 23 minutes.
@cogentgene @dagorenouf He does an awesome job. See his content daily.
@Piyushscopy Value = sales
@NotechAna I like to think so too, Ana.
@jasonstrimpel I appreciate that, my man.
@copyforcreators Haha. I saw that in another person's newsletter and borrowed it. I loved it.
@marketing_rabbi Sell them out of their negative present and into their positive future.
@shrutiad96 That's probably a good idea.
@_anthonydisney Thanks, Anthony. I appreciate that.
@chrisrickard Sometimes you gotta ask, but I try to keep it 90% give, 10% ask.
@blakeaburge Love it! Amped that you have a course now, Blake. Long time coming, my friend.
@matt_gray_ I love that line, Matt 🔥
I almost never sell my products.  I sell my knowledge, insights, and expertise daily.  Product sales are simply an outcome.
@jonbrosio Exactly. That's such a killer way to do it, Jon. Love it.
@agazdecki Congrats, my man. You're an inspiration. Keep going!
@Billionaire_CL Very helpful.
@lipholo_lipholo It's certainly sealing the deal.
@parvezvai Go get some data.
@_SyedHuq That's literally perfect. Nailed it.
Solopreneurship 101:  When pitching your product, turn data into stories.  Stories hook. Data supports.  Together, they work magic.
@writingtoriches Just started doing this a few weeks back and I've been pleasantly surprised.
@JustinWise @CasJam @SahilBloom @Codie_Sanchez Much appreciated!
@TMitrosilis Thank you so much, Teddy!
@dickiebush Appreciate you, man!
@hiyabodhi @hypefury Thank you!
@nathanbarry I stopped using Airbnb because they have the poorest customer service around.   So many problems, absolutely zero solutions.
@hendcm Thanks so much, Henrique!
@srini_bala Thanks for subscribing, Srini. 🙌
@Jayyanginspires Can't wait to send it out, Jay.
@thedankoe Thank you, my man. Appreciate it. 💪
@austinbelcak Boom. That's the way it works, my man.
@CheetSheets Thanks so much!
@NickSloggett Thanks, Nick!
@SahilBloom That means so much, my man.
@mounttopmoney Looking forward to sending it out!
@aaditsh Thank you so much, Aadit.
@darentsmith Excited to send it out, Daren!
@sleplae See you there, Susan.
@Shaynmtl Appreciate it, Shayn.
@MarketerHayden Thank you so much, Hayden.

It's better to say no to distractions than be the person everyone likes.
@thedankoe @Ekemini_udoekon Boom.
@dvassallo As someone who jots down ideas randomly, have you ever found this to be untrue?  I'm wondering if you have ever thought, "I wish I could remember X."
@dickiebush I love this, Dickie.  Build a system for teaching yourself something new.  Then, go out and teach other people who don't have that system.  A great way to build expertise and trust.
@writingtoriches That's right, Charles.  I've actually found that there are some rules that matter and others that can be broken to your advantage.  Like in any field, trendsetters often break the most well-established rules.
@thedankoe When you reach out to someone you admire, assume you are 1 of 100 people doing it.  1. Differentiate yourself 2. Provide relevant value 3. Make a response frictionless
@agazdecki 1. Learn to write 2. Learn to tell stories 3. Learn to paint a positive future  Learn sales.
@imThomasMorales @naval Damn. I love that. Never heard that of his...
@DevanshiGup @copyforcreators I'm hoping that people catch my drift.
@itsadityabansal For sure, Aditya.
@thenathanpeters Thanks, Nathan.
@thejakeerickson Ha. Thanks, Jake.
@iamcryptoyogi Keep going down the funnel, Hitesh!
@_anthonydisney Exactly, Anthony.
@eitan_levy101 Definitely most people do, Eitan.
@copyforcreators Yep. Lots of options out there.
@sairahul1 Love it, Rahul.
@hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv.
@abhishekshah173 That's how I started, Abhishek!
@aaditsh Exactly, Aadit.
@BenjaminPutano That's the ticket right there, Ben.
@Piyushscopy Yep, Piyush!
What most people do:  - Trade their time for money - Trade money for stuff - Show off their stuff - Repeat  What you should do:  - Trade your time for money - Use that money to create assets - Use those assets to produce money - Use that money to buy your time back
Sometimes you just need to get away from it all.  https://t.co/MKsqwOj3Lj
@dickiebush This is one of my faves. Love the framework. As a systems thinker this makes my life so much easier.
@brandonthezhang Love that Brandon.
@rtgiordano Much appreciated man. Thank you.
@heyjoeyjustice Same.
@Reid_HF Thank you! That’s awesome.
@NiharikaSodhi @aaditsh You two are so kind. It means the world.
@Piyushscopy Thank you!
@NiharikaSodhi I appreciate that!
@TMitrosilis Thank you, my friend.
@eveliosilvera Thank you!
@calum_johnson9 Well, you're in luck:  https://t.co/RY5XsPKFXt
@alexgarcia_atx Thinking about switching up my routine.  Social media is no way to start the day. Coffee, sun, walking, and time with my wife is a much better way to get started.  Some good food for thought, Alex.
@dvassallo Building up your own community of motivated people can be the key.  Often, they'll just tell you what to build next.   Very little PMF research needed when this happens.
@dickiebush I'm right behind you! Let's GOOO.
@Nicolascole77 And the impact of virality is often not as positive as one might assume.  I've gone viral many times. Doesn't lead to much additional income or customers.  But 10 smaller Tweets aimed at my core audience, in aggregate, makes a world of diff
@masculinitytale True story.
@JordanReutas This is awesaome, Jordan.
@Darrenmmatthews This is awesome, Darren.
@BusinessEngines We must believe these problems can be solved.
@zaafirsalam Agreed, Zaafir.
@timduncaan Haha. Love that.
@thedankoe Damn. Love that, Dan.
@montipace Exactly.
@YashpallNirwan That's good to know I'm not just making it up 😂
@cogentgene I agree with you 100%, Gene.
@DemoMai99 Nice. Like this.
@HeyJimBurgess Haha. I've never thought about it like that, Jim.
@hermanvaswrites For sure, Herman.
@theDavidWenk I agree with you 100%. I've only ever worked for optimists and I guess I just don't see another way of thinking.
@plemasterr I love that, Phillip.
@iamcryptoyogi Yep. I love that, Hitesh.
@_SyedHuq Agreed, Syed.
@Shaynmtl Love that, Shayn!
@hey_dhruv I just like assuming that there is always a way.
@Zbijelic That can certainly be true...
Optimism is a business superpower.   Optimists solve problems before pessimists finish talking about why it can’t be done.
@SachinRamje @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 This is awesome man. 🔥
People rarely go broke investing in themselves.
@Nicolascole77 Thank you, my man!
@dickiebush Damn. Nailed it. Could not have said it better myself (and I tried)
@plemasterr @tdinh_me @JustinSaaS Damn. Whoops.
@_baillee If you can teach yourself, you can do almost anything.
@SahilBloom For sure. I’m 100% guilty of it.   It takes a lot of intention to fight through it.
@asearchforvalue Same, Hunter.
@The_GreatBonnie Thanks, Bonnie!
@matt_gray_ Absolutely. None of the rest of this matters if you have no strategy!
@blakeaburge Yep. Can't start without trying and failing multiple times.
@jasonstrimpel Love that, Jason.
@_anthonydisney @tdinh_me @JustinSaaS Yep. But if you can get it while doing what you enjoy, it certainly gives you more optionality.
@tdinh_me And, that's a wrap...  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these  2. Join my weekly newsletter for one audience and business growth tip each Saturday morning. You can always read it in less than 4 minutes, guarantee
@tdinh_me 10/ Follower count doesn't matter  It's not ALL that matters, but it's an indicator that your content is resonating.  And with that, you'll have a better chance to build a business, land a job, find opportunities, meet interesting people, etc.  
@tdinh_me 9/ Not everyone was meant to be an entrepreneur  Maybe everyone wasn't meant to build SaaS business, but entrepreneurship?  That CAN be for anyone.  Offer a service, sell an eBook, build a Shopify store, start a side hustle, etc.  Don't let peop
@tdinh_me 8/ If you have faith in yourself, you don't need a Plan B  Again, randomness and chance are at play here.  Build your career like a venture capitalist, not a venture-backed founder.  Have a plan A, B, C, D, E, and F.  Increase your chances, and 
@tdinh_me 7/ Work a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life  I love my job more than anything.  I've transitioned out of executive leadership in tech and into a full-time creator helping thousands of people.  It's still a ton of work.   The
@tdinh_me 6/ Good things come to those who wait  Good things come to those who take action in the short term and stay consistent in the long term.  Waiting and waiting until everything is "perfect" will yield the opposite of "good things".  It will likely
@tdinh_me 5/ There are no stupid questions  "Stupid" is a pretty subjective term, but there are questions that can easily be Googled.  If you skip Googling and ask (at work, in life, etc.) you'll be labeled as a liability rather than an asset.  Teaching y
4/ The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results  Randomness &amp; chance are at play in every attempt.   It's why @tdinh_me posted the same thing to Hacker News 4 times with no traction.   Then it blew up.   https://t.co/vX9Pmktuzg
3/ Cheaters never win  Nearly everyone who is someone has cheated in their ascension to the top.  It doesn't necessarily make it right, but it's 100% true.  And unfortunately, that's why we have a lot of poor academics and rich criminals.  Always be moderately skeptical.
2/ Quality over quantity  Sometimes.  But when you're just starting out in any new endeavor, repetition matters.  So start with quantity to help find the quality.  Then do both.  High output, high quality. Win/Win.
1/ Money doesn't buy happiness  It may not buy happiness, but it buys freedom and flexibility.  The more that you have, the easier it is to say no to things you don't like.  Doing less of what you hate and more of what you like makes you a much happier person.
10 business clichés that are lies (or at least misunderstood):
Study people, not algorithms.  Algorithms change.  People do not.
@austinbelcak Being able to communicate effectively through writing is something that anyone, especially entrepreneurs, should spend a lot of time practicing and perfecting.  Changed my life.
@GunToHeadCopy For sure, Santosh.
@iamcryptoyogi I agree. Lots of talk about niches, but I'm in the camp of having one.
@luke_netti Certainly is, Luke. Stay focused and develop one core skill.
@matt_gray_ Yep. Go deep on what you already know.
@thedavelyman This is really awesome. Thanks for sharing, Dave.
@createwithdee 100%
@CarinCamen That's the kicker right there.
@BlackEmpressoff Deepen them, and leverage them.
@TKAllDay62 Yep. But it all starts with simply being aware of what skills we already have. Lots of folks are blind to their own knowledge.
@digiarpit For sure. It starts there.
@connectABTweets Thanks, Abdullah.
@3PillarsParent Definitely. I just don't write for parents :)
@tomberryCD Nearly 100% of the time. Very true.
@KalimoLeboela @jenny_blake Awesome. I'll have to take a look. Thanks, Kalimo.
@KalimoLeboela I love that. And Cal Newport rocks.
@hey_dhruv Many people still need to identify the skills they have that they can monetize. They are often blind to their own value.
Most solopreneurs are long on ambition but short on strategy.  Before you try making money, make sure that you're identifying and developing skills you already have.  Once you've done that, monetization becomes much easier.
Yesterday, 27,843 creators learned my favorite:  1. All-in-one creator tool 2. Analytics platform 3. Testimonial tool 4. Twitter plugin 5. Newsletter  Did you miss issue #22 of The Saturday Solopreneur?  Read it here:  https://t.co/bTloRerENw

@matt_gray_ Nice thread, Matt. Thanks for the feature!
@daniel_nguyenx For sure, similar. That was the foundation for this with a few small tweaks.
@IAmAnasAmrani Thanks, Amrani
@ken_carroll For sure, Ken. Can tweak this many different ways.
@_areebpasha I don't really have titles for my stories. Just tell this one out loud on a podcast.
@KarlKaufmanADI Yep. A slightly different spin on the heroes journey, but that's the basic foundation for sure.
@andyfieb It's a great way to connect the audience to your journey.
@jdchernikoff @anacarmagnani @Johngamba7 Glad it was helpful, Josh.
@tejas3732 Thanks, Tejas!
Every solopreneur needs a well-crafted backstory.  This is an opportunity to tell your true story in a compelling fashion. To connect with the audience in a way that's human.  Here's my 7-step process for a compelling backstory.  https://t.co/OZ81iYCeOI
@blakeaburge The GCal nerd in me has set this one aside to dive in.
I love no-code tools.  They have made building a one-person business possible for everyone.  Tomorrow, I'm going to share my 4 favorite no-code tools, and one newsletter you cannot afford to miss.  Join 27,843 subscribers here:  https://t.co/vCOnWlle21
@thedankoe Systems are the foundation of any one-person business.  Anything you find yourself doing over and over?  Build a system.
@blakeaburge Do the work and life tosses you a lot more "luck".
@wes_kao I would argue less than 5% of people do this at the previous companies I worked at. Those were always the folks that made it to the top.  A wonderful way to stand out.
@writingtoriches 1. Record a 30-minute interview. 2. Chop it up into 10 LI, Twitter, and Instagram vids. 3. Put the conversation on podcast page. 4. Turn it into 5 TikToks.   The combos are endless.
@victor_bigfield @ImraneSubstack @softr_io @airtable @gumroad Shit, thank you man. :)
@austinbelcak Put your thoughts into the world and meet other like-minded (or opposite minded) people.
@GuruAnaerobic Appreciate the share so much. 💪
@stephen_parato Thanks, Stephen. It helps me.
@TheAnkurTyagi I love that about it, Ankur.
@kylegawley Fair point.
@MrRyanKeeler How we use it. Exactly, Ryan.
@cogentgene Gonna try that here shortly.
@theartofchaoz Once you realize it though? Game changer.
@_anthonydisney Nailed it, Anthony.
@tomberryCD That's exactly it, Tom.
@Piyushscopy For sure!
@afu_dev Absolutely, Adrien.
@IAmAnasAmrani Good call.
@chrisrickard Yep. Same here.
@jessebmaher It can all feel like a chore if you think of it that way. Think about building insanely valuable relationships and it becomes quite a bit easier.
@EmanThinks That's right, Gordon.
@jayclouse Me and you both, man.
@TMitrosilis That's the lens through which to view it for sure, Teddy.
@thedankoe Yes sir.
@victor_bigfield @softr_io @airtable @gumroad Let's GOOO. Love this. 🚀
When you stop viewing Twitter as a chore and start viewing it as a 24/7 networking event, you'll no longer stress about content.

@ericdrowell @Natalie_Furn For sure. I just happen to focus on soloprenuers.
@TMitrosilis Thanks, Teddy!
@tomberryCD @Natalie_Furn So much time.
@plemasterr You get a lot "luckier" when you know a bunch of brilliant people.
@fitwithrashid Yep! Or things just pile up.
@JonathanDanger4 The worst.
@Zbijelic Yep. Worth trying interesting new things all of the time.
@hey_dhruv That's certainly a very large part of it.
@JosephSeifert22 I think it's ok to consume. That's where I get some of my best inspiration.
Things that kill a one-person business:  1. A big ego 2. Not networking 3. Not having a VA 4. No experimenting 5. Ignoring feedback 6. Too many meetings 7. Very little marketing 8. Not saying "no" enough 9. Lack of business systems  Avoid as many of these as possible.
@imJBrowne @thedankoe  https://t.co/xr1PG3nCsq
@thedankoe  https://t.co/xr1PG3nCsq
@Nicolascole77 ❄️
@Codie_Sanchez If you can keep the same demeanor and attitude through both the worst and the best, you'll likely be pretty excellent at what you do.
@agazdecki Too much validation from non-prospects. Not enough validation from actual prospects.
@writingtoriches All advice is contextual to the person giving it. That's why I rarely ask, "How did you do X?". Instead, I like to collect information, test it, see if it works for me in a similar fashion, and discard it if it doesn't.
@dickiebush I've got you matched on that first 5 hours.  Same meal? I'm too much of a foodie!
@austinbelcak One part of my plan is simply outlasting everyone else 😂
@baltunt @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Thank you, man!
@KarlKaufmanADI I think this is it:  https://t.co/NpmCY3UEES
@TMitrosilis I don't ask much anymore, except for passively in the LI comments. This is my one.
@thedankoe One of the biggest distractions are meetings and events you should have originally said "no" to.  My advice: Create a "NO" template. Something that is kind but firm, that you can use every single time someone asks.
@gaviningham Simple, but skipped by 99%.
@TothSebastien There wasn't. Just an ask :)
@AuthorOnTheSide Correct. If you give daily, you earn the right to ask. That's my philosophy.
@KarlKaufmanADI Wrote a post online and asked people to buy it if they were suffering any of the problems that the product is intended to solve.
@FinessToday Wrote a post online and asked people to buy it if they were suffering any of the problem that the product is intended to solve.
@aaronmmota Give 90%, Ask 10%
@kylepdotco Haha. What is it??
@CheetSheets Exactly.
@jayclouse For sure. But sometimes it's as easy as saying, "If you struggle with this, my product will help you. You should check it out today."
@sweatystartup Boom 💥
@iamcryptoyogi Yep. And if you give enough, you can make that "ask".
Sometimes you need to ask people to buy your product.  If you don't, you're missing out on 12x days.  Simple as that.  https://t.co/8LIJUMXB8w
@Codie_Sanchez This is dope. Going to build out ours this weekend. Thanks for the push, Codie.
@agazdecki Y'all are just killing the game. Congrats, man.
@writingtoriches Here's what I have:   - Weekly must-do - Daily must-do - Daily intentions  Intentions are less about work and more about pulling away from work to accomplish things that make me a happier person.
@keyurkumbhare Absolutely valuable, Keyur.
@heykahn Same. Or someone will come across a post of mine from 2020.
@AdamVazquez @EmanThinks Oh fur sure, Adam.
@EmanThinks @cogentgene Ain't that the truth. Sometimes I think I've got a banger and it flops. Then the reverse happens.
@jasonriedel @EmanThinks I post 2x per day and comment 20x.
@itsconchur Good luck!
@chieybae Way better than chasing virality.
@EmanThinks Good rule to live by.
@amichalek For sure, Andrea.
@StartupGotts Awesome. Welcome back!
@IAmRobGee That's it. And sometimes adjusting a few words makes a world of difference.
@_rubiopaty For sure. That happens all of the time for me.
@JohnIsBuilding Damn. I love that.
@JosephSeifert22 Thanks, Joseph.
@hey_dhruv That's it, Dhruv.
@nomadsammey I'm sure you grew followers. The "new followers" number is always wrong.
Most Solopreneurs misunderstand content.  It's not about daily virality attempts.  It's about having thousands of your thoughts in the ecosystem at any moment in time.  1000+ pieces working hard on your behalf.  So, publish frequently.  Because you never know what will resonate.
@dickiebush This is why I say no to 90% of what comes my way.   I'm either working on something for someone else, or I'm working on improving my business, and therefore my life.
@austinbelcak I think most people work for money to provide for their family. There's no shame in that and it's common at most large companies.  I think the best people get aligned a company &amp; mission that they believe in and do great work. The money 
@the_jacobmartin Nailed it. The "luckiest" people often put in massive action, Jacob.
@SallyCreator You can't outwork the value of relationships!
@praveneum For sure, Pravesh.
@SeanPHogue Same. Give to get.
@thedankoe Absolutely.   Just jamming out on Zoom with you and 50+ other people over the last 6 months has greatly increased my "luck".
@_SyedHuq It really doesn't, Syed.
@RSahasrarchi For sure, Rohan.
@nicolasmerouze The better you are at a skill, and the smarter you work to improve your chances, the "luckier" you get.
@danielakpobare It really is, Daniel.
@keyurkumbhare You'll find yourself in the right place at the right time more frequently if you increase your luck surface area.
@HirschiIvona An art that most people struggle with.
@itsedaxe The better you work, the luckier you seem to get.
@camp_wealth Same. Weird huh?
@Diwakar28801704 Same. Karma game.
@cogentgene Isn't that funny how it works?
@theTonyNash For sure. Once you build them, everything else becomes much easier.
@JoeHolka Definitely part of it.
@hey_dhruv That's right. Systems certainly have their place in increasing your luck.
@matt_gray_ @dickiebush @rosiesherry @harrydry @austinbelcak @aprildunford @AmandaMGoetz @businessbarista @gregisenberg Thank you, Matt!
How to improve your luck:  - Make noise - Hone in on signal - Double down on that - Support other builders - Engage regularly, with care - Turn great engagements into 1:1s - Turn 1:1s into meaningful relationships  The more relationships you build, the more your luck intensifies.
@heyeaslo @TrungTPhan @chrishlad @david_perell @dvassallo @nathanbaugh27 @Codie_Sanchez Much appreciated, my man. Thank you.
@tdinh_me Anytime, my man. I love your product and I love sharing products that genuinely help, are priced fairly, and that get better constantly. That's yours!
@Emilio_emb @Codie_Sanchez Much harder than I would have anticipated, but a combo of written and video process docs is a life saver.
@TothSebastien @gregisenberg Purchases. I presell before anything is built.
@gregisenberg Every product I've built started as an idea and a landing page. I don't build it until there is monetary proof of interest. Good stuff, Greg.
@Codie_Sanchez Built video process docs for the 6 things I spend the most administrative time on about 3 months ago.  I estimate I'm saving about 40 hours per month of work and reinvesting that time into creative.
@heyeaslo You can spend $10k per month and grow your online business or you can spend $0 per month and grow your online business.  Some tools make it easier/faster/more efficient, but in the end, you can get it done at nearly no-cost.  Congrats!
@jasonriedel It pulls based on handle. So you'll just see my best stuff since the change.
@jasonriedel It wont have most of them because I changed my handle 2 weeks ago. Womp womp.
@LoganBrownSWS @SahilBloom Voice notes mostly.
@AlexAndBooks_ Then write 15 minutes per day on top of that. Watch what happen.
@SahilBloom I love silent time. This is when ideas flow into my brain most frequently. Driving, showering, doing the dishes.   Way more helpful than listening to a podcast.
@Nicolascole77 Can Typeshare fix the fact that I can't type on my phone? 😂
@MakadiaHarsh @SahilBloom @blakeaburge @DruRly @JamesClear Thanks so much, Harsh! Appreciate your support.
@heykahn Heck yeah, Zain. Congrats, man!
@Zbijelic Haha 😂
@abhishekshah173 @BrianFOConnor I think offering a service is generally a helpful starting point.
@cleiton_dev Lots. Check out my website.
@dancumberland I haven't done anything yet.
@Zbijelic @heychazza Get after it, fellas.
@SimplyAzodo Thank you!
@AdamVazquez Can't wait to see 2027.
@hendcm Panic attack in late 2018 started it all.
@kurtbuilds Thanks, Kurt. I'm sure you'll be right there with me!
@BrendanHufford Very, very true.
@Meshrhm Get after it, Mesh. I wish you luck.
@_baillee I'm excited to see 10 years down the road
@WrittenMastery Luck is usually an outcome of a lot of hard work.
@CheetSheets It felt very, very long. :)
@TMitrosilis I sure hope so. And many thanks, my man!
From burned-out exec to 7-figure solopreneur:  2019: Burned out at my exec job 2019: Began consulting 2019: Rates @ $250/hr 2020: Niched down 2020: Nailed offering 2021: Increased rates 5x 2021: Built a digital product 2021: Built a paid community 2022: Pacing 1.5M+  Long game.

@thedankoe That SCAMPER is solid, man. Stealing.
@tdinh_me Always. Thanks for the new "how-to" page. I learned a lot of tricks for using it more effectively.
@Lowlip2 Because I'm not trying to make money by mentioning these products. I like them and I like the founders.  I just want to see them succeed and I like being a part of that.
@SahilBloom Easy way to get started is with a Pomodoro timer.
@thedankoe Warning: reading about how to do something won't actually get it done.
@LuisDuquePE Thanks for reading, Luis.
@Ownit_Fran Benefits of all of these are seen over time, never immediately.
@Darrenmmatthews Thanks for reading, Darren.
@5harath @twemex @followerwonk @hypefury @blackmagic_so It's amazing, Sharath. Highly recommend.
@ahmed_tobar_1 Welcome, Ahmed.
@igorbenic @thedankoe @tdinh_me For sure. I absolutely love it.
@kylepdotco Thanks, Kyle!
@Jabuto_Jabuto Awesome, thanks, Jabuto.
@nickvitucci Nope. Maybe one day though.
@jakevictor_ Hell yeah. I've been here!
@blakeaburge It's a game-changer. I'm terrible with spouse and kid's names and whatnot.
@Soumyadeep_0 @twemex @followerwonk @hypefury @blackmagic_so @TwitterBlue More. About 400+ per day.
@thedankoe Sweet! It's such a great tool. Especially once I started to truly understand the power.
@tomberryCD Sweet. It's a great little tool.
@PersuasionProf Awesome. Have fun!
@thisiskp_ It's such a powerful feature, for sure.
@AlanJLSmith @Nicolascole77 Amazing! Thanks for being a customer. See you inside.
@sweatystartup Absolutely, Nick. So glad they were helpful. 🙌
@camp_wealth Right?
@AlexAndBooks_ It's amazing. @dvassallo talks about it quite frequently, and ever since @tdinh_me released his "how-to" video set, it's been a game-changer for me.
@AlanJLSmith @twemex Yep. You're right. Whoops.
@vrsceo Thanks, Varun.
@MakadiaHarsh Thanks, Harsh!
@justingordon212 Thanks for reading, Justin!
@SahilBloom Oh damn. It's my absolute favorite tool on Twitter.
@henwalkco Thanks, Henry!
@zachtalkswealth I Tweet 2x per day, and by staggering RTs at 9 hours, my schedule looks like this:  Tweet 1: 730a Tweet 2: 12p RT1 : 4:30p RT2: 9p  Basically, good coverage.
@CPASuperHero Well, now you are!
@Zbijelic @twemex @followerwonk @hypefury @blackmagic_so @TwitterBlue For sure, Zlatko. Agreed.
@LokeshLohaniSMM @twemex @followerwonk @hypefury @blackmagic_so @TwitterBlue It's great.

10 powerful Twitter hacks every user should know:
@msskwan Yes. You want to write about your expertise. Not mine.
@thedankoe One person, one problem, one solution. Help them get from point A to point B.
@dickiebush Share your knowledge from the beginning. Share it again when you have a larger audience. Then again, and again, and again.
@ChaseArbeiter That's a question many of us arrive at when it's definitely too late.
@mattmylin Absolutely correct, Matt. Don't let it rule you.
@Nicolascole77 Congrats, man! Enjoy the drive.
@thedankoe Once you figure out how to turn discomfort into comfort, you're on to something. That's where the change happens.
@AuthorOnTheSide For sure, Hassan. Don't work for terrible people.
@changingdailly Love this, Darren.
@Shaynmtl That's basically what I decided.
@yukti_sood Yep. Can be very difficult, but it's best to try.
@mikeying77 Yep. Go make lots of money in a job that treats you well and you're winning.
@_anthonydisney Sure. But those aren't the people I write for.
@keyurkumbhare For certain, Keyur.
@yekeenAyo Always.
@polak_jasper Same.
@jkerr25 I'm glad you learned it!
@vcuody Life is pretty damn important, yes.
@copyforcreators I enjoy that quote...
Never work a job that destroys your mental health.  Even with massive pay, it doesn't work.  Instead:  1. Find a great role 2. Focus on your mental health 3. Spend time working on passion projects 4. Turn them into a full-time business over time  Harder to do when burned out.
@matt_gray_ @Shopify @gumroad Thanks for the shout, Matt! Always appreciated, my man.

@aaditsh Really solid thread, man. I'm a huge fan of the 5 why's.
@MichePriest @theandreboso Thank you, Miche!
@writingtoriches Do interesting things offline and talk about them online. That's basically it.
@AlexAndBooks_ And books aren't the only way to consume people's knowledge.  - Podcasts - Youtube videos - Digital courses - Social media content  So many ways to consume and learn.
@aaditsh This is some really, really good, clear advice.
@michaelsklar That's right. Focus on the process and the rest often comes.
@coachjillian A second house ;-)
@itsedaxe Focus on the audience and distribution and that money will be a nice outcome.
@sujitdevkar Help people to help yourself.
@CheetSheets That's 100% true.
@timduncaan Very cool. I'm just learning.
@keyurkumbhare Definitely, Keyur.
@omarakhaddaj That's right. Monetization is an outcome.
There's too much focus on monetization.  Making money is great – but the best solopreneurs realize that money is an outcome of audience and distribution.  Focus on that.   The money will likely come.
@LBacaj @sweatystartup Thanks, Louie!
@ChaseArbeiter I don't actually know, to be honest. I feel like 5,000 - 10,000 is probably a good starting point. It's my understanding you can typically charge about 5% of your subscriber count per issue, in dollars.

@blakeaburge These are amazing, Blake.  Bookmarked 💪
@dvassallo Probably the best community I've been a part of.  Organic conversation, smart people, good learnings.   A no-brainer if you're into making investments in yourself.
@gregisenberg When I worked in tech, it was the people. I came from a farm town in Ohio and when I met people who wanted to change the world, I was astounded.  If I ever go back, it will be for the same reason. Brilliant, forward-thinking people.
@writingtoriches Feeling this, Charles. Great Tweet.
@Moe_Shaltout That's classic survivorship bias, though.  Instead, look at the number of people who tried to do it like the "greats" and failed.  When the denominator is high, it tells a much, much different story.
@heybrandan Appreciate that, Brendan!
@heyjoeyjustice 🚀
@marktenenholtz Might not be too far from the truth.
@LBacaj Thanks for spending your valuable time reading it, Louie.
@CoreyWilksPsyD For certain. I'd recommend a phased approach, however.

@blakeaburge Same. 57 at the present moment over 6 months.
@writingtoriches The best way to improve the likelihood of showing up is by creating systems that remove much of the friction. Good stuff, man.
@hellokellybrito Thank you, Kelly!
@aaditsh Smart man :)
@aidanxbriggs I love the weekends. One hour each weekend morning with zero distractions.
@AKASpencerScott Very cool, Spencer.
@SahilBloom Validation from someone doing it.
@Martini_NFT 60 minutes per day over two years is the equivalent of working 90, 8-hour days. You can get a side hustle to a stable place with that effort.
@jdubya001 Exactly.
@eitan_levy101 For sure, Eitan.
@ManjhunathRavi I don't know. Everyone has different lives and it would require a tremendous amount of context. But, generally, if you can't make money on your own, you need to find it somewhere.
@willcoombe Exactly. I'd rather make long-term strategic decisions with less pressure.
@OzolinsJanis It's generally easiest (IMO).
@matt_gray_ I like that, Matt!
@mkhundmiri Thanks, Mustafa.
@ayushtweetshere Yep. Even if you get to 80%, you're in a better position.
@zaafirsalam I think so too, Zaafir.
@AuthorOnTheSide Yep. Less risk, more optionality.
@OneMike33 There are outliers in every situation for sure. I still believe that taking a phased approach is best.
@thedankoe Yep. Some people are wired to perform in that environment, but many others aren't.
@mihir_narula I always found 30 in the AM and 30 in PM.
@hendcm Always the long game.
Solopreneurship 101:  Don't quit your job and then start building your own business.  Find 60 minutes per day to work on your business and use your job as investment capital.   Once your business is paying your salary, then consider going all in.  Almost always a better choice.
@dvassallo Same goes for my online business. If I can learn it, apply it, and then use it many times over, it's worth it.
@aaditsh I love that, Aadit. Damn. Adding to my Notion workspace as a reminder.
@wes_kao "Practical and tactical" is my motto.
@agazdecki Congrats, man!
@matt_gray_ @sammarelich  https://t.co/7h7N29bYcm
@jstnalmzn @TheJamesWillett Oh good! Just making sure it didn't come off that way.
@TheJamesWillett @jstnalmzn I hope this didn't come across as 9 to 5 "hate".   That definitely wasn't my intention. I loved my 9 to 5 for 16 years.  I think it's worth discussing the downside of having no safety net though. And in order to do that, I thin
@sammarelich Thank you so much, my man. That was a really fun call, and I think we landed on a solid strategic framework and excellent tactical steps.   Thanks for being so open and coachable.
@SergioRocks @dvassallo Daniel was the first person I started following deeply on Twitter and then built my business by simply listening, observing, and then executing on things I thought had a good chance of working.  3 years later, here I am.
@AuthorOnTheSide Smart question, Hassan.
@mattgiaro I agree, Matt.
@3PillarsParent Smart preacher, Catherine.
@Zbijelic It's not easy to do, but if you take a step-by-step approach, it can be done. And I think the safety is worth the journey.
A lot of people are getting laid off.  This is the often-ignored fragility of being employed.  $80,000 salary one day. $0 the next.  This is why I champion the anti-fragile principles of diversified solopreneurship.
@writingtoriches I've had to have this same conversation with myself. It's a great mistake to learn from.
@austinbelcak People love to point out consistency, but consistency is often the result of recognizing that much of life is about persistence.
@Growthmediaco Very, very, very few products sell themselves.
@willcoombe 100%, Will.
@_SyedHuq For sure. Nothing better than learning what people wan during your conversations.
@writingtoriches I changed my newsletter CTA from "Subscribe" to "Join 26k+ entrepreneurs" and conversions went 📈
@Jayyanginspires @collinnieman Smart man. Good image.
@TMitrosilis Appreciate that, Teddy.
@Piyushscopy Exactly.
@collinnieman Thanks, Collin!
@hey_dhruv Nicely captured, Dhruv.
@ApprovedSide Exactly. Not a chance.
@henwalkco Thank you, my man. 🙌
Build a reputation before you build a product.  - Figure out who you love spending time with - Talk to them about their challenges - Learn how to truly solve them - Share what you learn daily - Repeat  This will lead to a wonderful reputation.  Then sell something.
@businessbarista I asked every reference to force rank a candidate's ability and then dig into the lowest-ranked skills.  I've found this to be a great way to really uncover problematic issues.
@AlexAndBooks_ The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel.
@aaditsh If you're doing interesting things offline and not sharing them online, you're missing out.
@agazdecki The truest definition of failure is never starting.
@NashSevereWx Any hail?
@Nicolascole77 Hbd brother 🎂
I see a lot of solopreneurs working on their weaknesses instead of doubling down on their strengths.  Reverse it for maximum growth.
@AlexAndBooks_ @CoryGearrin Yep. Or Carrd + Stripe is really easy.
@dickiebush It's like sending a bunch of salespeople into the vast internet world carrying your message. The payoff is incredible.
@renzil I'd start by creating attention. Getting discovered means the rest of the funnel becomes much easier over time.
@blakeaburge Yep. Outlasting people is a strategy.
@AlexAndBooks_ Yep. You stop getting "required reading" and start reading what you're passionate about.
@agazdecki Works well for creators too (and just about everything else)...
@WrittenMastery 100%, Zaid.
@danielakpobare For sure. Systems = consistency
@omarakhaddaj Correct. But I still push.
@hey_dhruv Have a consistent theme and become known for one thing.
@matt_gray_ Great ways to do it, Matt.
@AngeZanetti Yep. That's mine. But if you want to go deeper than info products, you probably need a deeper funnel (IMO).
The Solopreneur marketing funnel:  Discovery: Short-form content ↓ Trust: Newsletter/Podcast/YouTube ↓ Relationship building: Online community ↓ Service business: Advising/consulting/coaching ↓ Productized services: Digital courses/subscriptions

@mattnwalsh I wasn't suggesting they would, but I think they can.  I just meant the thought process behind diversification is important.  All VCs to founders: "Go hard on one thing!"  All VCs to themselves: "We have diversified our risk across many things

@shivtom_sq1 I agree, Shiv.
@MySuccessTheory Thank you, Stephen!
@JamesonCamp It's both. ☯️
@CoreyWilksPsyD I love hearing (and learning) more about it.
@dvassallo Quietly folding down projects with no obligation to explain is extremely freeing. I've done it 2x in the last 90 days.
@alexgarcia_atx #1 👀 Get after it, man.
@writingtoriches Focus on consistency and no "zero" days. The other metrics will be an outcome of that.

@_baillee Thank you, Baillee!
@SahilBloom Yeah, definitely leaned on that a bit. It was fun thinking through it from my personal journey's perspective.
And that's a wrap.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Your action:  7. How often are you sharing your opinions and work freely online?  8. When interesting opportunities come your way, are you seizing them?  9. Are you staying consistent and creating compound momentum?
Your discipline:  4. Do you assume full responsibility for your life?  5. What changes have you made to help design a life with more intention?  6. What system(s) have you built for creating strong habits?
Your purpose:  1. Do you truly appreciate time as currency?  2. What is your motivation for time freedom?  3. How have you curated an environment that supports your goal?
In Summary  The journey towards designing a life of intention never ends.  Here are the three groups and nine key drivers to always be improving, in the form of simple questions you can ask yourself ↓  https://t.co/sz4s4Q1Xaa
The Undisciplined Creator  This is someone with motivation &amp; action but no discipline.  They share freely &amp; shine a spotlight on their work. But the success isn’t immediate.  Then they crumble. The world isn’t fair. Why should I change? I want to keep doing things my way.  https://t.co/Bwl6Zo7hry
The Aimless Producer  This is someone with discipline that takes action, but they lack purpose.  They are heads down on work &amp; in competition with others. Moving full speed ahead.  They never stop to consider purpose, making it an unfulfilling hamster wheel with no end in sight.  https://t.co/fbBtkeZyfF
The Passionate Dreamer  This is someone who understands their purpose &amp; has started to put in place discipline.  They talk often about recreating their lives. The challenge? They never start.  They can’t pull the trigger and they never move forward.   It becomes just a dream.  https://t.co/jH2hW6HaUO
The Problem: Most people get 2 out of 3  When I speak with people who are attempting to design their life with more intention, they generally fall into the “2 out of 3” camp.  These are the 3 combinations that never seem to make it. ↓
Momentum  Momentum in life design is no different than momentum in business.  Creating &amp; seizing opportunity compounds over time, and compound work wins over short-term hacks.   When something works, double down.   When something fails, eliminate or iterate and try again.
Opportunity  Opportunity is one outcome of sharing your ideas.  It attracts other interesting thinkers.   Doing so will help you develop skills.   Use those skills to build assets, and those assets to create income.   With that income, you create more time. The cycle continues.
Change  Change means breaking away from the routine &amp; false comfort of the traditional system.  It means doing new &amp; interesting things with new &amp; interesting people.  Only when we extend our comfort zone can we truly grow.  The fishing is often best where the fewest go.
Ownership  Ownership is understanding that you are completely in control of your own life.  Nobody is coming to save you.  Yes, some people have it tougher, while others have it easier. This is factual.  But believing you don't have control fundamentally destroys the concept.
Environment  Your environment is what &amp; whom you surround yourself with.  Time and purpose like a seed, &amp; environment like soil &amp; water.   It’s tough to grow around pessimists, the unreliable, or untrustworthy.  Curating the right environment creates the ecosystem to thrive.
Motivation  Motivation is what drives you. Why are you creating time freedom?   If you’re creating it without specific motivation, it's likely that you will be unfulfilled.   The goal isn't to do nothing.   The goal is to avoid what you dislike and do more of what you love.
Time  We all know that time is our most finite resource.   The currency of life.   But we tend to forget when faced with the day-to-day work, family, and obligations.  Understanding that time is the ultimate currency is the fundamental driver of intentional life design.
Your first reaction might be this sounds childlike or fantastical.   I’ve made peace with the potential judgment.  I believe it’s a more natural way to live than the assembly-line, 8-hour workday life we’ve inherited from the 1860s.  Let's start with 3 buckets ↓
First, what does it mean to design an intentional life?  Here’s what I’ve landed on:  - Doing what I want, when I want, and with whom I want - Doing very little of what I don’t like &amp; more of what I do - Being free of traditional full-time employment - Having limited obligations
9 steps to designing a life of intention:  (and why most people fail)  🧵
@FawazShak Everything is easier said than done.
@cwcnicholas Focus on the 20% that matters.  Eliminate, automate or delegate all else.
@Jayyanginspires @naval @viziandrei @thedankoe @SahilBloom @zachpogrob @jackbutcher @ShaneAParrish @iamjustincscott Thanks, Jay!
@aaditsh If the statement, “how we spend our days is how we spend our lives” is true, then habits are how we spend our days. Because better habits mean better days, then it’s not a stretch to believe they are a core driver of a better life.
@writingtoriches Amazing what you can accomplish for free. Zero friction and incredibly high upside.
@MehulFanawala @divya_gandotra @MakadiaHarsh @blakeaburge @shreyas @aaditsh @mkhundmiri @jspujji Thanks!
@JackieOnBrand @JasonRBradwell Thanks!
@DaniloKreimer I've certainly highlighted this many times.  Single Tweets should never be taken as business manuals.   They should be looked at as part of a large collection of contextual advice.
@rajachirravuri @NandoCaralt @AliAbdaal 226 days.
@PaulElijas I'd start with a service business because that helps influence everything else. You learn so much about your customer.  I don't wish I had started sooner. I am happy with the skills I picked up.
@NandoCaralt @AliAbdaal I think people believe you just pop open Slack and you're ready to rock.  The reality is an incredible amount of customer service work, and probably 2x-3x more time than you ever even imagined.
@IshBaid Because putting all of your eggs in one basket is almost never good advice in anything. Algorithm changes, market changes, platform changes, etc. all can impact a business. I'd rather diversify with light-lift, high potential options.
@dvassallo Don't slog through activities you hate only to find out they aren't in the 20% that even move the needle.
@dickiebush Clarity &gt; clever. Love Hemingway app for this.
@austinbelcak Assume that whomever you are reaching out to has 100+ other people reaching out as well. Look through that lens when asking.
@thedankoe Most people's biggest enemy is themselves.
@aaditsh This is why I don't spend any time reading about the morning routines of Jeff Bezos. I'd much rather just talk to someone who is a few steps above me on the ladder.
@AliAbdaal Not necessarily avoid, but I think people jump into building a community before fully understanding the work effort.
@Codie_Sanchez Same here. I have had 57 impostors since October and they are scamming people out of money. Ridiculous that this is such a huge problem.
@jspujji If you can find both trust and complimentary skills, run fast at that person.
@agazdecki Help other people get better, and you'll ultimately get better as well.
@heyeaslo Go deep and understand every nuance. Once you've mastered it, expand then. Slow and steady.
@creation247 Additional life hack: Find anyone who feels the complete opposite and spend zero time with them.
@SachinRamje I would, yes. Maybe tack on a community for course owners.
@SachinRamje I'm not sure that there is a perfect sequence, but I think starting with a service business helps you understand how to do the others more successfully.
@theBMcopywriter It's the best thing I've ever done, Zohaib.
@thiagofeysu #2 and #5 are both services, no?
@Kachi77_ I just have an LLC.
@dominicnebula Yep. Service businesses are a great starting point.
@sairahul1 It sure does, Rahul.
@feelthebyrn1 I love this, Gordo. Well articulated.
@luke_netti They keep building and building, Luke.
@matt_gray_ Love it, Matt.
@AuthorOnTheSide Much, much easier. Exactly, Hassan.
@TMitrosilis Thank you, my man!
@VeekthorOdey Thanks, Victor.
@hey_dhruv I agree, Dhruv. Huge.
@MatthewJersan 🤔
@keyurkumbhare For sure, Keyur.
Treat your career like a VC.  Build a portfolio of revenue streams, knowing one will hit big.  1. Courses 2. Coaching 3. Subscriptions 4. Paid community 5. Consulting &amp; advising  The diversified entrepreneur.
@benkellyone Really nice thread, Ben. Thanks for the kind mention. Cheers.
@EmilioSLozano @jordigarcia Thank you! 🙌
@mrRubyDevv Thanks for the shout. Nice thread 🙌
@camp_wealth 100%, Rachael.
@hermanvaswrites For sure, Herman.
@NicolasHoferer Absolutely, Nicolas. Talk about the journey from negative present to positive future,
The very best marketers sell positive futures.
@Shaynmtl Love that.
@mtamas5 @dagorenouf It doesn't have to be low revenue or high risk.
@CSMikeCardona Same. I think of those years as investments in my business of today.
@TMitrosilis It sure is, Teddy.
@Natalie_Furn @gumroad Thanks, Natalie!
@omarakhaddaj For certain.
@TeshyT5 Anything worth doing is hard, sure.
@billydavies___ Don't compete on rate. Find your "why". Your competitive advantage.
@omarakhaddaj It's a win/win. You learn SO much.
@mercyosaghai Nailed it, Mercy.
@NicolasHoferer Yep. Productize your service then raise your service rates.
@_baillee Agreed. Harder at first. Easier in the long run.
@navdeepsoni Thinking "quick money" is the worst way to head into anything.
@willcoombe I think so too.
@hey_dhruv It's a bit tough to get started, but once you have momentum, the benefits seem to outweigh the risks as well.
If you work for a company, you have professional skills.  Take those skills to the open market instead.  Sure, you'll have to make some noise and attract customers, but you'll charge 5x more than what you make at work.
@thisiskp_ Thank you, KP! My goal is "practical and tactical."
@wes_kao I love "show, don't tell".   When someone can actually show me the difference between negative present and positive future, it's incredibly impactful.
@NicolasHoferer Thanks!
@NicolasHoferer Mind reporting him?
@NoelDavila I haven't. Maybe I'll give that a try. Thanks!
@autotrader87 Crypto scams.
@NoelDavila @verified I don't qualify, unfortunately.
@separmeen Oh, I know, I was just saying I'm surprised that someone hasn't started a class action lawsuit yet.
@JohnIsBuilding LOL
@Matthew_Fenton I have a file on my computer called "Twitter License" because I have to upload my driver's license every time I report these accounts.
@separmeen Sure, but when someone runs a scam under my name, it's probably lawsuit time.
@tweetsbyejordan It's NON STOP.
@RoisinPovall @elonmusk I hope someone can fix this dumpster fire.
@ricardoclarke It's really annoying.
Just reported my 57th impostor in 5 months.   Twitter is an absolute mess.  https://t.co/uOGQhfU5cl
@JohnIsBuilding For sure. But even "great" advice isn't always great, because it's highly contextual.
@JamesonCamp Same for me.    Every person who thinks they "hate" me would probably feel differently if we had a beer and talked about life.   They'd find out quickly that I just want them to win.
@AlexandraAllen_ Congrats! While you may not think it's much money, it's the beginning to a long, exciting, journey of building wealth on the internet. That's something to celebrate! 🎉
@thedankoe The FigureoutabilityOS
@TMitrosilis This is the way.
@billydavies___ For sure, Billy.
@keyurkumbhare For sure, Keyur
@hey_dhruv Yep, but the best advice comes from simply doing.
@thedankoe Figureoutability is #1 in nearly any job. A must.
The less predictable your career, the less helpful "how-to" advice is.   Becoming a lawyer has a pretty straight-line path.  Becoming an entrepreneur doesn't.  Don't blindly follow someone else's advice only to find out their luck isn't on your side.
@nstrvs @aryan_kochhar @OneJKMolina Thank you!
@khemaridh Had a blast chatting with you, Khe.   Looking fwd to seeing what we come up with.   Just 2 old guys trying to figure it out. 😂
@NatashaTynes I'll take a "mostly" agree :)
@matt_gray_ Appreciate it, Matt!
@davedoescopy So glad to hear it, Dave.
@singhcredible Thanks, Jeremy!
@learndosell Don't guess. Study it or use a preview tool.
@Aazarshad Aware? Of course :) Legends.
@luqmanux Thank you, Luqman!
25,137 subscribers just learned 4 Twitter copywriting mistakes.  Today's issue covers how to:  1. Craft better opening lines 2. Eliminate Sophisticated jargon 3. Reformat Tweets for better reading 4. Alleviate audience blame vs. finger-pointing.   https://t.co/7WEBTiBU3z
@blakeaburge CMD + Shift +5 is how I create every screenshot. One of my faves.  The ability to control other people's screens is wild. I had zero idea about that.   Great tips here, man.
@_baillee Thank you!
@jayclouse  https://t.co/OmYSqsYaWw
@jayclouse What a great feeling, Jay. I’m pumped for you too and rooting for you here in Nashville. Good vibes headed your way. 📈
@dcgunner Thank you!
@nomadsammey The creator funnel #004
@matt_gray_ Thanks, brother!
@FerracoFTW Thanks, Mike!
@heyjoeyjustice See ya tomorrow, Joey.
@YanceySanderson Give it a few issues. If it sucks, unsub :).
@wardy0006 I dig this GIF.
A lot of good Tweets bomb.  And I see 4 copywriting mistakes that are to blame.  If you fix them, your Tweets have a much higher likelihood of success.  I'm going to cover all 4 tomorrow in my newsletter.  Get the issue fresh in your inbox at 8a CST:  https://t.co/vCOnWlle21
@AndreasGwosdz Amazing! Keep going, man.
@drernestomd @LinkedIn Very interesting...Just shared in A&amp;I
@luke_netti @davedoescopy So true.
@drernestomd @LinkedIn Is this mobile or desktop?
@TMitrosilis Ahh. That's a great idea. Thanks, Teddy!
@luke_netti Correct. Plus, most people need to hear a core message hundreds of times before they'll act on it.,
@luqmanux Yes sir.
@daniel_nguyenx This is hilarious 😂
@getpaidwrite Yeah, that sounds boring!
@dklineii Nailed it:  - Step-by-step - Observation - Past vs. present - Listicles - Contrarian thoughts - Comparisons - Teardowns
@sairahul1 Glad it resonated, Rahul.
@EdmundOris Right here.  https://t.co/Nj9IWzTq5G
@marcus_motheo Thanks, Marcus
@_baillee Exactly, Baillee.
@GeorgeNoble07 For sure, George.
@fitwithrashid It helps you speed up production while staying true to your message.
@sarvamwriter Nice, Sarvam!
@omarakhaddaj Yep. And if you have 10, it gets wild.
@ayushtweetshere I do this all of the time.
@Denis__Shatalin It sure is tougher.
@OscarLagrosen Not in the structure, but maybe similar.
An easy way to write more Twitter content:  1. Write a Tweet 2. Rewrite it in 5 different ways 3. Schedule it once per month for 5 months 4. Repeat.  Learn to say 1 thing 1,000 ways.
@matt_gray_ Thanks for the shoutout, my man!
@NatashaTynes @jessievbreugel Thank you! 🙌🏻🙏
@luqmanux I don't think so, no.
@alexzecheru I hope that's a good thing?
@Shusmo Glad we could make it happen, and excited to see your business grow, my man. Cheers 🍻
@henwalkco @jessievbreugel Thank you, my man. This is a mention I take to heart. That means a lot, truly.
@matt_gray_ @LisaNicoleBell I sure hope so :)
@fitwithrashid @LisaNicoleBell Awesome. Thanks for listening.
How do you build a 7-figure business after burning out?  My conversation with @LisaNicoleBell pulls back the curtain on it.  We talked about:  - Transitioning from executive to entrepreneur - Designing an intentional life - Time management - And more   https://t.co/DN8FsQ5KzN  https://t.co/OLmTArtTy6
@paulcanetti Oh, for sure!
@dbustac Thank you, sir. Right back at you.
@iamcryptoyogi Heck yeah. Get after it!
@asatryan_v Boom!
@pyewaw Start and keep going.
@DenverNowicz Good job getting started though.
@wordsy_aaina Thanks, Aaina.
@yukti_sood Everything is saturated. Find your little corner of the internet and own it.
@Varun_Bosmia True story.
@CryptonianPrime We're all learning. That's the good news!
@jameskonn Yep. 3 months from now you'll wonder why you didn't start earlier.
@morgan_prakash Most good things are daunting!
@caitmackcs Just hit Send.
@martyna_io That's a smart man, that Epicurus.
@storymentor I like that, Derek.
@LoganBrownSWS Yep. Still...most people think about tomorrow instead of today.
@hey_dhruv Exactly, Dhruv. You got it...
@CheetSheets Nailed it.
@TheMoney_Wizard For sure. Start and don't stop.
@matt_gray_ It almost never has your best interest in mind.
@TMitrosilis Just kick the ball forward.
In 10 years it won't matter if you started Tweeting here in 2018 or 2022.  The most important thing will be that you started.
@AlexAndBooks_ Just crossed 25k today. I hope so! 100k my stretch goal. Thanks for the boost!
@dbustac Thank you so much for the kind feature here, Daniel. Appreciate being featured with some legendary folks. 🙌
@AlexAndBooks_ Damn. These are a bunch of professional, big-time newsletters and then there's my rinky-dink newsletter 😂  Thanks for including me with some giants, Alex!
@yukti_sood Yep.
@AshleighVoellin Heck yeah, Ashleigh. Thanks.
@L1fe4Mktg Thanks, Marina!
@JosephSeifert22 Thanks, Joseph!
@Praadigi @Twitter @ejordanill @victor_bigfield @IAmPascio @just_karthik_ Thanks!
@amzfreelancer @BlackLabelAdvsr It's desperate for creators. That's why the best creators on Twitter are now flooding LinkedIn.
@amzfreelancer Haha. Probably.
@jamie_dru Yep. That's why it's become so easy to stand out if you do it the right way.
@TMitrosilis Of course!
@dklineii Love that, Dave. So true.
@subhamshweta Exactly, Subham.
@barrettjoneill It's the starting point for sure,.
@matt_gray_ Yep. Helping others achieve their wildest dreams will almost never go unnoticed.
@TMitrosilis That's a damn good idea, Teddy.  Btw - pumped to see you crushing Twitter. Keep going, brother.
@MichaelJNovotny It's nearly impossible to fail when you show people how to reach their goals and become an integral part of helping them get there.
@5harath I agree 100%, Sharath.
@luke_netti Yep! #4 ensures people introduce you to other interesting people.
@Jayyanginspires This is your best one. I love it. NFT time.
@ItsKieranDrew For sure. But establishing who you are, what you believe in, and how you think is critical.  I'd say hit "publish" on those thoughts and see who finds you. When they do, help them.
@CSMikeCardona 100%. The relationships are formed behind the scenes when you help other people.   Online is just like offline. I think some people forget about that.
@hermanvaswrites It sure is. But helping them achieve their goals takes it to the next levle.
@hey_dhruv That's exactly it. Karma growth.
@keyurkumbhare Give to receieve.
How to network:  1. Create content 2. Publish it into the world 3. Attract like-minded people  Most people get these steps right. It's the 4th step they miss.  4. Help them achieve their goals  That makes it fail-proof.

@dickiebush If only everyone has listened sooner 😉  In all seriousness, if you can write well for Twitter there is a massive opp for you on LinkedIn.   Come join us.
@adityatheverma Correct. It all starts with using your acquired skills to become an intrapreneur.
@swaycopy For sure. But gotta nail these 4 first.
@sahilkhosla Yep. Start as an intrapreneur.
@CheetSheets 100%. Consider your employer your investor.
@shannoncolon For sure. Look for the intersection between what you love and what clients tell you they want more of.  It all starts by interviewing your clients and interviewing yourself.
@AnandButani Definitely. Anything good requires thoughtful decision-making.
@kristofferryeng @testimonialto Thanks, man! :)
@heywarco Thanks!
@timduncaan Definitely good ideas, Tim.
@codejedii It took me 16 years because I spent the first 6 years screwing around.  Plus, the internet didn't exist in the same capacity it does today back when I entered the workforce.
@DakeAkshay Thank you, Akshay. Good luck out there!

@Nicolascole77 Same here, my man. It's easy to see your a systems guy simply because of your incredible production.
@dklineii 2022 is more about audience growth than promoting. Trying to think long term here.
@hellokellybrito @dagorenouf I want to scale down, not up.
@CheetSheets For sure. Doesn't have to be my way. Whatever works :)

@Manisha_kh @NotionHQ It's my favorite tool of the ones listed, for sure.
@fitwithrashid 100%. Highly recommend.
@hey_dhruv Appreciate that, Dhruv!
@rehacks_ Thanks!
@lexpaval With such an interesting network, I want to make sure that I remember to reach out and support regularly.   The 13-week thing helps for sure.
@blakeaburge @JamesClear Appreciate you, my man. Thank you. 🙌
@SahilBloom Same here. As I grew, I started to get disorganized. Notion saved me.
@WealthProfits It's such a great tool...

James Clear said:  "You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems."  But most people don't build great systems into their work.  Here are 6 critical systems for creators:  (and how I built them)  🧵  https://t.co/VOHHM9RKoI
@SriDwantoPinuji Yep!
@iLucaMicheli NICE!
@KateBour @dennis_geelen Running to sign up for yours like...  https://t.co/J6tspaxaWj
@aaditsh @austinbelcak Love to see it :)
@mrobertsmktg Nope. I have about 3-5 people in my ecosystem that I try to engage with daily.
@endamacnally I just picked a day (Tuesday - see you at 11:44a CST) and stuck to it for the most part. I miss sometimes, but that's just human nature.
@GeorgeSiosi Yep. I've never Tweeted more, that's for sure.
@MichaelNatelli This is the only thing I've done since the beginning, but, as usual, what works for me may not work for you.  I'd recommend experimenting and testing to see what really helps. The answers are always in the data.
@timduncaan I'm not sure. Experiment and see if this works for you, but give it time.
@eladdio Yep, for sure. It's my job though. So that makes it easier.
@Codishaa Went from 8k to 101k followers, and my business has grown from roughly 800k per year to about 1.5M per year.
@GregHlavaty Twitter and LinkedIn really aren't that different when you break them down.  1. Teach 2. Entertain 3. Challenge 4. Empathize  Most content isn't very good on LI, but that actually makes it easier to stand out if you can create high-quality co
@espressocopy Yeah, it's a great question to ponder. Things change so frequently, that tactical advice (from anyone) becomes outdated.  My thought it just keep producing and everything should correct itself.
@bbourque 😀
@ayushtweetshere Thanks, Ayush!
@matt_gray_ Thanks, Matt!
@TMitrosilis You can't get to everyone, especially once you have hundreds of thousands of followers.  It's a bummer, but just the reality.
@WealthProfits Use a content matrix.  One side with topics. One side with formats.  Mix and match.
@thetrunkgym Keep going, Coach.
@yukti_sood I think so yes.
@Jayyanginspires Dude, this is awesome.
@connectABTweets I spend about 45-60 minutes per day.
@jamie_dru Good luck, my man.
@MakadiaHarsh Love this, Harsh!
@tomberryCD I do, but altered to be platform relevant.
@AuthorOnTheSide Anywhere between 2-4 weeks usually.
@MichePriest Don't overdo it. Keep it manageable and you're more likely to stick with it.
@espressocopy Honestly, when I moved from 1x to 2x, I just started growing 2x as fast.  Doesn't necessarily mean it works every time, but it's working for me, so thought it made sense to share.  Interesting to hear your side though for sure.
@Chadmgreenlee So glad to hear that, Chad!
@therahmanashiq 8-12 depending on creativity level.
@DarpanJain It would be much, much, much less effective, IMO.
@Christian_rson Thanks, Christian.
@YannBrds It's certainly not easy.
@yodunbar Nice, Christian!
@iammosesaboh For sure, Moses.
@WealthProfits It's tough. Build out systems that improve likelihoods.
@adammarx13 @austinbelcak It's difficult, for sure. Lots of people can't find time or don't want to play the game...that's understandable.
@hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv. It's called "social" media.
My social media strategy:   Tweets: 2x per day Threads: 1x per week LinkedIn posts: 2x per day Weekly Newsletter: 1x per week  Then, each day I spend about 45 minutes interacting with my audience.  Do this for 6 months and watch what happens.
@JoshLindblom52 I built out a calendar that helps me stay on track with deep vs. wide and educational vs. challenging, etc.

@KevinKellyUSA @StephenKing There are outliers in nearly everything, but I don't know enough about his criticisms to understand the comment.
@NextToWealth For sure.
@fritzvdw You realize how hard it is, and how criticizing others who are trying no longer makes sense in the mind.
@itsedaxe Same here. I'll never criticize someone trying.
@Aidarousheikh Exactly, Aidarous.
@ProBoDotCo I've found this to be 110% true.
@ross_davies Totally, Ross.
@luqmanux Ain't it though?
@blakeaburge FACTS
@ThePupOfWallSt That's how I think about it, Danny.
@ayushtweetshere Yet, we live in a world of a million critics.
@caitmackcs I don't. I'm Dikembe Mutombo on here.
@robertbalazsi Ha. I'm not super familiar. Haven't spent much time there.
@EmilioDiMarco2 That's why most people default to criticism.
@keyurkumbhare For sure...
The people who criticize the most, create the least.
@Nicolascole77 This is a dope thread. Even after a ton of course sales, I've bookmarked this as a checklist for my landing pages.  Thanks for this, dude.
@matt_gray_ Thank you, my man :)
@CPASuperHero No, I've had my Twitter account since 2009. I never Tweeted regularly until October of 2021. I tried before, but it was sparse, and I just ended up giving up each time.  Something about this last try has been different.
@JamesonCamp The biggest "hack" is doing good work for a long time. Weird, huh? :)
@brianbeers Consistent and linear followed by some nice spikes.
@AlexLlullTW Thank you, Alex. The same to you, man.
@thisiskp_ I used to think that Twitter should be used like a microphone. One to many.  What I've come to realize is that it's more of a networking event than I ever thought.  So, building strong relationships has led to better growth than just writing "a
@jamie_dru @chrisxmunn Appreciate you, Jamie!
@adam_crates Yes, for sure.
@CooperKraussKC That's the key right there, Cooper.
@GrammarHippy Love that addition, George. Noted.
@zachcapshaw Ha. I appreciate that, Zach.
@will_b_cameron Just people I find interesting for the most part.
@barrettjoneill Appreciate it, Barrett!
@HarrisFanaroff Yep. The execution is the hard part.
@mountainsnmoney Get started, stay consistent, and you will.
@austinbelcak Appreciate you, my man. Looking fwd to connecting later today.
@AlexAndBooks_ Thanks, dude! Just tryin' to catch you over here 😉
@dklineii Haha. Right, Dave?
@_rubiopaty Thanks, Patricia!
@LoganBrownSWS Linear in the beginning, more exponential as I got further and further along.
@TMitrosilis Thank you, man!
@jimmymoncrief I do. I write ahead of time and use @hypefury for automated publishing.
@vinikloppel People want "hacks" and "tricks" when mostly it's just simplicity that's key.
@linwoodschulman Yes. My business revenue is set to grow about 60% this year.
@jappleby Yeah, I remember that actually, Jack.  I don't know if this helps, but 10% of people will hate you no matter what you write/do/say.  I just block and move on. My content is not a democracy.
@thetrunkgym Definitely. It's not easy. But think of it as a long-game play.
@_Vault_Security Welcome!
@JacWida Basically.
@heavyjab I don't want to write daily threads, so for me, yes. For you? Depends on what you feel comfortable doing and how it resonates with your audience.  It's about what your audience tells you, not necessarily what I think.
@jappleby Threads for sure.   But I don't think those threads would have given me the same results had I not built relationships with other creators.  Sometimes (not always) you get lucky and they RT you and that's where the biggest jumps happen.
@EvergreenMEP Appreciate it, Greg.
@Jayyanginspires Thank you, Jay.
@CheetSheets Commenting. Sometimes leads to DMs, but commenting works best for me.
@thetrunkgym For me, it's mostly just comments. Sometimes those turn into DMs, but I never cold DM people. There has to be a reason.
@WillFlindall On Twitter or anywhere?
@aaronmmota For sure. It's no secret hack. Just consistency and improvement over time.
@KarlOftebro Thanks for reading them, Karl.
@keyurkumbhare Absolutely. Looking fwd to seeing you here, Keyur.
@FuelerHQ Appreciate it 🙌
@dsvaughncsp Thanks, Scott!
@timduncaan No right answer other than what you learn from your specific audience.
@copywithkush Pick people you're inspired by or would love to get to know more deeply.
@AngeZanetti I'd rather keep it small and meaningful.
@heychazza I don't know. I don't know what you do, who you help, or what you help them do.
@matt_gray_ For sure, Matt!
I’ve Tweeted 217 days in a row.  And added 93k+ followers.  Here are 4 simple lessons learned:  1. Share one useful tip each morning. 2. Comment under large accounts. 3. Engage with 3-5 people daily. 4. Write 1 thread per week.  That's it.  Hope that's helpful.
@Natalie_Furn @jspector Just admin, gatekeeping, and customer service for the most part.
@SachinRamje Thank you, man! :)
@Natalie_Furn @jspector Nope! Just a VA. I think of my content as my marketing "team".
@Praadigi @dvassallo Thanks!
@DaniKimble2 That's so amazing to hear, Dani. Thank you (and congrats)!
@_SyedHuq Thank you :)
@_SyedHuq Love that.
@jlcossi Sounds about right.
@matt_gray_ Get after it, Matt.
@LoganBrownSWS It really is, Logan. Deliver value. Learn. Iterate. Repeat.
@CheetSheets Nailed it. This is it.
@itsedaxe It sure does, Ed.
Solopreneurship isn't about a great idea.  It's about attracting people &amp; delivering.  Average idea + great marketing + quality delivery = a viable business  Today's a great day to start.

@marktenenholtz Thank you so much, Mark. 🙌
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
- No 30-day email course. - No complicated integrations. - No audience segmentation. - No abandoned cart emails.  None of these things are bad btw.   They would probably help me increase sales.  But they aren't necessary to start &amp; be successful.  So 
7/ Create an army of affiliates  After completing the course, customers receive an invite to become an affiliate.  I pay out 35% vs. the standard 20%-25%.  This has led to $15,000 in revenue in just the last 3 months.  Not bad for no work.  https://t.co/GNOJfodFXX
6/ Automate testimonials  When the course is completed, I embed a Testimonial capture inside of the last lesson.  The ask is simple. A quick video or text testimonial.  Then it automatically gets added to my landing page.  Check it out:  https://t.co/1OiZqvaPot
5/ Deliver 100x value  Part of the "impulse buy" strategy is to surprise and delight the customer.  "The best investment I have made in the last year" - Dominika Vasova  This is the kind of feedback I'm after 👆🏻  https://t.co/9ZGEytGyTf
4/ Create urgency with discounts  A simple 25% to 35% expiring discount (24 hours only!) drives purchases.  A well-crafted ask + impulse pricing + expiring deal = 💰  I average about $14k in 24 hours when I ask.   It gets seen by 80k to 120k people.
3/ "Impulse buy" pricing  The amount of trust you need to sell a $979 masterclass is insane.  When people come across my products (especially on "ask" days), I want them to "pull the trigger" without thinking.  Make it easy.  $100 to $150 is my sweet spot.  https://t.co/jF45x69WBo
2/ Ask 10%-20% of the time  As you continue giving away valuable information, you earn the right to make an "ask".  Once per week, I ask my audience to buy something.  I make about 15x the revenue each "ask day".  You can see this playing out in my sales below.  https://t.co/zhbeqybFQm
1/ Deliver daily value in a niche  I've spent 3 years on social media talking about audience &amp; business growth.  All of my best lessons already exist as content. They are literally all free.  The good news is people will pay for aggregation.  So give freely.
How I made $1M+ selling online courses.  (with zero complicated funnels)  🧵

@Daniel_Nyi Definitely. Building something meaningful isn't always exciting.

@theficouple Love that.
@adammarx13 Yep. The customer facing stuff all looks sexy, but the reality can be quite the opposite.
@TechLeaderPro Oh, for sure.
@StefanoN1991 That's a gift.
@KushShah9492 Correct.
@thatYouTubGuy Stick to the things that matter and execute daily. It might be boring but the results are exciting.
@omarakhaddaj Yep. I'm just trying to outlast folks.   Walking a damn marathon here...

@jmikolay The Naval part is something I think about a lot.   Curiosity takes care of nearly everything else. If you're curious, you will likely figure it out. If you figure it out, you will likely win.
@marcust86550577 I'm not sure. I don't do much with holistic health so you're much better off asking your ideal customer. Whatever they tell you will be much better than what I tell you.
@Jayyanginspires Damn, this is awesome :)
@_rubiopaty @MikeYing77 Correct. Back in late 2020.
@yashtheOG Absolutely. What are we doing if not making the world a better place.
@tweetsbyejordan Definitely. Be kind to others. Karma is real.
@tomfallowfield Ha.
@feelthebyrn1 Thank you, Gordo. That means a lot!
@NiharikaSodhi It's such a great feeling to bring people on your journey.
@jameskonn 100%, James.
@Nicolascole77 Damn, that's some smart thinking there. Loved the way it's phrased. Thanks for sharing.
@matt_gray_ It certainly is, man.
Entrepreneurship so often feels like a Karma game.  I'm convinced that helping others over the course of your career is the single greatest investment you can make.  Those that succeeded without this are the exception, not the rule.
@MikeYing77 I picked advising early stage SaaS companies in the healthcare vertical.
@Ownit_Fran Boom.
@KushShah9492 Yep. It's not necessarily grinding, but definitely playing the long game.
@NiharikaSodhi That's the fun part. It is!  Wait until 5 years from now...
@gauravsingh961 Once I truly and deeply understood how to solve specific common problems my customers encounter. Then, I'd attempt to solve them in less than 60 minutes via a course.
@caitmackcs I ask every single time. Easiest way. $0 acquisition cost.
@omarakhaddaj Basically :)
@LoganBrownSWS Just gotta get creative. There is money to be made everywhere.
@omarakhaddaj For sure. This is just one way of many different ways to get started.
@theNickFriend Definitely an awesome way as well.
@yassenshopov I'd ask for intros from the companies I helped for free.
If I had to start my solopreneur journey over, here's what I'd do:  - Pick a skill I know cold - Talk about it daily online - Offer to help 3 companies free - Track meaningful improvements - Get a few testimonials for my website - Ask for intros to other companies &amp; charge $$$

@vadiefe @JamesonCamp Hotel Escondido Oaxaca
@_wolfganggruber @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @EvansNifty @TweetHunterIO Thank you! 🙌🏻
@will_b_cameron @JacobSuckow @AlexHormozi Thank you!
@joserosado @JamesonCamp Love it here 🇲🇽
@JamesonCamp Weak.   I’m in Oaxaca, Mexico and the charcuterie game is on point (and only $3)  https://t.co/19fBZmv01U
@zaafirsalam Try a bunch of things and see what resonates. Then double down!
@I___DEREKflint Yep. It's both art and science. You have to actually have an outcome in mind usually.
@rainar_angelo For certain!
@zaafirsalam Writing on Twitter IS building your audience organically.
@theahmedemiola Great, Ahmed!
@MikeYing77 It's a good question. I think the other 5 can be paramount when building a sustainable business online.
@AuthorOnTheSide I try to get a "yes" to all 6.
@omarakhaddaj Thanks, Omara!
@hey_dhruv A lot of people struggle with that, so hopefully these 6 q's will be helpful.
@teaceoo I don't worry about grammar or spelling usually. Mistakes are human.
6 questions I ask when writing content:  1. Is this related to my niche? 2. Is this a unique viewpoint? 3. Is this content easy to read? 4. Does it create a conversation? 5. Would I have stopped to read this? 6. Does this teach, entertain, or challenge?
@matt_gray_ @gregisenberg @Julian Appreciate it man!
@MikeZegarelli Thanks, Michael!
@katairobi @thetriloktomar @aaditsh @AlexLlullTW @join2manish @MakadiaHarsh @MeetKevon @jackbutcher @jayclouse @jayacunzo @amandanat @wes_kao @AliAbdaal @SahilBloom Appreciate you
@gregisenberg Ahh. Appreciate the read, Greg. Thanks.
@gregisenberg Great thread, Greg. I went the course route and confirm it’s a great way to make your living (or extra income). Bolt on a community, then build a Micro-SaaS that helps people reach goals in the course.
@omarakhaddaj @Nicolascole77 Thank you so much!
@SachinRamje Thanks for sharing my man. 👏🙌🏻
@ken_carroll Damn. That’s a great compliment. Thank you, Ken.
@dickiebush I’m not a beginning writer, but there are so many good fundamental reminders in here (plus new gems) that it earned a bookmark from me.  Nice work.
@marsdenkline @dklineii @Its_Jenn_Here  https://t.co/hjUGa1KQEU
@dklineii @Its_Jenn_Here @marsdenkline Thanks, man. That's so awesome to hear :)
@brianbeers Thanks for being a subscriber, man.
@luqmanux @matt_gray_ Thanks, Luqman!
@CoderMatching I just wrote all of that inside of the newsletter. Give it a read!
@StefanoN1991 @agazdecki @heyeaslo @MrJacobEspi @AlexAndBooks_ @JamesClear @david_perell Thanks, Stéfano!
@TnvMadhav Thanks for sharing, man!
@joshrwade Awesome. Thank you, Josh. 🔥
@matt_gray_ Thanks for reading it, Matt!
@TMitrosilis I think so too. So many creators I talk to, talk about unscalable things. Especially in the beginning.
@dklineii Insane thread, Dave. Nice work! And glad I could be a tiny sliver in your journey. Appreciate you, man.
@blakeaburge Oh, snap. Love it.
22,547 people just received my guide to finding 1,000 true fans.  Here's the TL;DR:  1. Think like a niche streaming service 2. Become a category pirate 3. Have a compelling story 4. Do unscalable things  You can read it here:  https://t.co/CB3IDOGOpo
@blakeaburge Do GCal next. Would love to up my game!
@randywilburn @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @LinkedIn Appreciate the follow, Randy!
@imThomasMorales Thank you, Thomas! Much appreciated, my man.
@matt_gray_ Appreciate you, Matt!
@_peterlister @matt_gray_ Thank you!
@jessievbreugel @EvansNifty @OzolinsJanis @AlexLlullTW @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @NiharikaSodhi @tibo_maker @samanthademers thank you, my man 🔥
@imThomasMorales Added Twitter!
@MJCrandall This is just LI and Twitter. Would be significantly higher if it were my newsletter as well.
@theorencohen_ 3-4 weeks usually. Sometimes less, sometimes more.
@austinbelcak The more clickbait stuff that's out there, the easier it is for long-game players out there.
@omarakhaddaj I hope those are true 🙂
@TMitrosilis I have a feeling you’ll be there soon too my man.
@ShaunEls Thanks, Shaun!
@timduncaan For sure.
@timduncaan Twitter and LinkedIn. If I added in my newsletter it would be significantly higher.
@dickiebush Ha. Love that, man.
@dickiebush 3 great prompts. Loving the atomic essay look here from Typeshare. Very cool way (and different) way to pack a lot of info into a Tweet, rather than using a thread.
@KarlKaufmanADI Oh for sure! I'm an investing junkie.
@adityatheverma Amazing. I love hearing it, Adi.
@CheetSheets Keep going...that's the mantra. Outlast people.
@NiharikaSodhi Amazing, Niharikaa! Keep it going 📈
@gaviningham Haha.
@matt_fergen Thanks for being a customer, Matt.
@LoganBrownSWS Thanks, Logan!
@badgradesclub Best of luck! Just 30 minutes per day to start.
@MarketerHayden Get started and keep going. That's the secret.
@anastalaz Yes sir.
@sarvamwriter Keep going, Sarvam!
@hey_dhruv I'm definitely not, but appreciate it!
A writing journey:  2018: 700k impressions 2019:  9M impressions 2020: 23M impressions 2021: 38M impressions 2022: 225M impressions (projected)  It's not about more. It's about how it compounds.  Start today &amp; you'll be thankful over the next 5 years.
@dickiebush Amazing thread. I love me some new tools. ❤️
All those questions you have about solopreneurship get answered when you just start.
@victor_bigfield Thanks for the mention, Victor. Much appreciated.
@misterparker Yep. Grew one from $0 to over $70M in ARR in about 5 years as the CRO.
@imjameskonn Writing.
@eran_dror Also a great move!
@JorisFalter Same. I'm most creative then.
@OliverJones_19 Systems often help keep that motivation moving forwardd.
@luke_netti Thanks, Luke!
@thisisming Depends on what you're checking in on, to be honest. If I'm looking at social growth, I'm checking weekly to see how I'm improving.
@gauravsingh961 I think so too, Gaurav.
@MikeYing77 Correct. Systems lead to outcomes.
@hey_dhruv That's exactly it, Dhruv.
Solopreneurship isn't about time, it's about discipline.  - Big goals - Check-in points - Daily action steps  My calendar is 40% regimented and 60% flexible.  Regimented for consistent achievement. Flexible for new opportunities.

@Dr_Tahoe Thanks, Greg!
@I_am_Prachiv 100%
@AuthorOnTheSide True story, Hassan.
@AkanjiJoshua2 @MrJacobEspi Sure there is. Give 'em all away.   99.9% of the world is incapable of doing anything with your idea.
@growthcurrency Love when you ship good sh*t, Dylan. Keep going, brother.
@Matthew55648341 I think one of the biggest lessons in life is that we learn the most when we do.   It took me 30 years to realize it.
@John_DA3 Aggressive.
@monaddevs Lol
@RealReaperCEO 📈
Stop tweeting about your big ideas.  Go execute &amp; tweet about what happened.
@William3Willis Congrats!!
@_SyedHuq @thedankoe Awesome! Thanks man.
@aaronhayslip @amandanat Templates and copy/paste are very different things.
@thisiskp_ Great stuff, KP. Thanks for including me. I feel honored, my man.
Build in public as a solopreneur.  Worst case?  You fail and have an insane digital resume.
@sajjanbalar Correct. A person helping me out virtually.
@IAMIDarlington @amandanat This wins the internet today. I love it. Thank you for the good laugh.
@thcmpny_ @amandanat Haha.
@amandanat @seempaq I won't share who it is, because one day when he least expects it, I'm gonna f*ck up his world 😀
@amandanat I commented on one of his posts and then just blocked him. I get plagiarized, word-for-word, every single day on LinkedIn, and weekly on Twitter.  People can steal the content, but they can't steal the journey.
@seempaq @amandanat A popular Twitter marketing account (Amanda follows him) once asked me to explain my distribution process on Loom.  I did.  15 minutes later, he stole it step-for-step and sent it out as a thread to promote his new newsletter.
@amandanat That's a bummer. I recently found out a guy from Italy was plagiarizing every single thing I wrote, but just translated it to Italian. 😂  Ballsy.
@Nicolascole77 This is why the world is full of poor academics and rich criminals.
@JamesonCamp @clintavo @girdley I've been to Madrid, Lisbon, London, Edinburgh, and Oaxaca in the last 60 days.   I see less than 10% of folks on the flight wearing a mask, but this is probably because I'm in Nashville.   I'd hypothesize that it's much hi
@clintavo @girdley @JamesonCamp I'm on a flight to Oaxaca, Mexico at the moment. Feels so good to be traveling continuously again.
@JamesonCamp See the very same thing. Astute observation.
@CMwritesalot Well done!
@ChrisBadgett Love that, Chris. 🔥
@MakadiaHarsh Nice work, Harsh.
@EvergreenMEP 100%, Greg. A missed opp so often.
@realjefflarge In service businesses, there is usually multiple options to consider, so I think honing in on the "why us/me" part of it is critical.
@prestesonline I agree with you for sure on this. So many unclear landing pages.
@CraigtoCreate Exactly, Craig.
@espressocopy Really good stuff, Chris. I appreciate you sharing that.
@OanaLeonte2 Part of the copy for sure. The why usually gets them to the offer. The offer generally needs to describe the transformation.
@OscarLagrosen For sure, Oscar.
@hey_dhruv 100% Dhruv.
@CheetSheets Tell me more.
@ManjhunathRavi For sure.
@MentalWeapons Exactly. Not features. Transformations.
Online Course Marketing 101:  Your offer should answer, "What, exactly, will customers achieve?"  It's not: "Learn how to invest in the market."  It's: "In 1 hour, you'll learn to invest your first $10k in the market without an expensive advisor."  Outcome clarity is critical.
@dklineii @_MetaProperties @amandanat @RobinNYC @blakeaburge @barrettjoneill @thesamparr @ShaanVP @SOLBigBrain @aaditsh @realEstateTrent Thanks man!
@nickflynndev @dvassallo @LBacaj Thanks for the follow and glad I’ve got ya thinking. That’s my goal! Have fun out there.
@dickiebush Of course, man!
@BestGhostAudrey 24 per month
@petesena Really enjoying Zirtual.
@willstew @jspector Listen to Josh. He’s dropping valuable knowledge! Love it.
@Maninoveralls Yeah, definitely want to get there. Just need to pause for a moment and get it all setup.
If anyone wants to save some time, head into my GDrive and make a copy of this Excel sheet.  Thanks!   https://t.co/B6GP4jKHl7
@DJS1914 Does this work:  https://t.co/B6GP4jKHl7
@juliemichellemo Not yet, but probably could be.
@Nicolascole77 Top notch advice. I forget this sometimes. Great reminder.
@kellylions @aibrahima With 315k social media followers, I get 50+ emails per day, so they are partially acting as gatekeepers.
@aibrahima If your team is begging you then there's something there. Why not ask them why they're begging?
@JonTuckerUSA Yep, Zirtual.
@BrandonFluharty Zirtual.
@kuroschkhz I have zero team members. Just a VA! I do all of the writing, newsletters, courses, etc. myself.  I should though. It's literally my full-time job.
@jordanenjoy_ 1. Admin tasks 2. Customer support tickets 3. Login/password issues  All of this stuff is so distracting during the day.
@YvonneHappy Awesome!
@jason_taban Zirtual is where I hired mine.
@jstnalmzn Certainly, Justin.
@ColoniaCamilo For sure. Working with a VA requires a very granular process.
@andreaplopezr Awesome!
@luisantoniomata @soonyoungstokki Companies have insurance built in and you simply grant them access with limited admin privileges. You can take it away with the click of a button.
@Howardmann Yep, Zirtual!
@ShaunEls Way more than I even assumed. She's been amazing.
@IndyDevDan Crabs in a bucket.
@iamcolemather Of course. Like the new name.
@jspujji @GrowthAssistant I'm not familiar. Checking it out now!   Thanks, Jesse.
@mojosarmy @calalouf Absolutely!
@SachinRamje It's actually kinda fun.
@StevenTrister Thanks, Steven!
@the_alphatrades @HeavyZen_ I hope it was helpful?
@ThePupOfWallSt Thanks for sharing it, Danny!
@luisantoniomata Zirtual has a plan for $750 a month.
@jamie_dru @abhishekshah173 @jayclouse Haha. Noted.
@iamvikeshtiwari Of course!
@barrettjoneill @SahilBloom Thanks man!
@mojosarmy @calalouf Thanks for sharing it!
@SahilBloom Appreciate it. I’m sure there are much deeper, more complex ways to do it but this is 101 for me.
@dikshayaar For sure!
@hey_dhruv 100%. One of my best moves.
@Manuelgweb @Gusramento Appreciate you sharing.
@kriti_dugar @taru_uppal Thanks for sharing it with folks, Kriti.
@_SyedHuq It's a huge time saver!
@KarlKaufmanADI I found mine through Zirtual. She's amazing.
@willcoombe @RohunJauhar Awesome! Will check it out.
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
// TL;DR  1. Audit your time 2. Record process videos 3. Store videos in Notion 4. Work together 1:1 for a month 5. Introduce workflow triggers 6. Review weekly
//The Outcome  Rather than context switching &amp; losing time, I review our worksheet 1x in the AM and in the PM.  This has saved me ~2 hours per day.  That's 40 hours per month.  And with firms like Zirtual charging $750 per month for a VA, it's a great way to get your time back.
5/ Move to a trigger-based system  Once we had worked together for a month, I introduced a trigger system.  1: Grant access to my email 2: She puts each email into a spreadsheet 3: I select the intended action from a drop-down 4: She sees the trigger and takes appropriate action  https://t.co/we6xWVR3Nq
4/ Spend quality 1:1 time  Spend your first few weeks or a month, working together 1:1  Meet regularly, give direct feedback, and listen if they have suggestions.  Some VAs are so experienced that they make your processes 10x better.
3/ Store the videos in Notion  Upload videos to a Notion page with additional instructions.  The most common instructions:  - Email templates to respond to prospects and customers - Username &amp; passwords for accounts they'll access - Links to other resources to support their work
2/ Record Process videos  Your VA won't always have the background to understand what they’re solving &amp; why.  So, record a video where you walk through every single step.  Share these with a few people who have no context &amp; see if they can complete the tasks you teach on video.
1/ Audit what distracts you the most  I pay close attention to my schedule to understand when I am most distracted, by what, and how often.  I keep a running tally each week to make sure I'm identifying any new distractions that have crept up.  Awareness is your first step.
Hiring a virtual assistant is life-changing.  My VA saves me ~40 hours of time per month.  Here's exactly how we work together in 6 simple steps.  🧵
@BrianCarmody @DrMDavis305 @growthcurrency @ash_lmb @lukematthws @OneJKMolina @MadalynSklar Thanks, Brian!
@JamieBlackrose Both. Actively surrounded myself and studied like hell.
@dickiebush Damn. As a time management and systems nerd, I’m about to implement a bunch of this.
@SGondalia @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 For sure people can! I just love giving them options. Thanks for the kind compliment as well, Samir.
@MJmeetstheworld No, because I don't do much client work. I've productized mostly everything I know, and it sells 24/7.
@SGondalia They are absolutely free to pursue that then.   I'm just sharing a different option, that's all.
@matt_gray_ @vinits00 @gregisenberg @dickiebush Thank you!
@MJmeetstheworld I don't want a boss. I want the ability to turn off/on at any moment. I want to be able to travel whenever I want, and spend my time doing whatever I want.  None of that is possible with employment.
@NisthaTripathi What a great group of folks to be mentioned with. Thanks so much, Nistha!
@dklineii Ha. For sure. Build an ecosystem of supportive creators. It goes a very long way.
@MJmeetstheworld The lifestyle I want to build has always been my why.
@matt_gray_ Nice thread here, Matt. It's cool to see the backstory behind the community. Keep going!
@SachinRamje You rock, my man. You've got such a great thing going with your visuals. Keep going!
@ManjhunathRavi You'll thank yourself in 3-5 years.
@eitan_levy101 Zero employees here.
@JoeHolka Can't wait to find out.
@drernestomd Haha. That's how it works.
@DrivingCS Enjoying every moment of it.
@OscarLagrosen Let's partner.
@DevprakashSahoo Exactly.
@KushShah9492 Thank you, my man!
@heywarco Same here!
@WillFlindall Thanks, Will.
@tejas3732 Same.
@separmeen Thank you, Sep.
@hey_dhruv Go for it. Listen to people, but pocket away their comments and keep going.
@matt_gray_ You too brother!
Reactions to my solopreneur journey:  - 2019: What are you doing? - 2020: How long can this last? - 2021: I've been following you for a bit. - 2022: Can I pick your brain for 30 minutes??  People project their own insecurities.  Ignore the doubt.
@briannekimmel 👋 Left my executive role as a CRO in 2019 and never looked back.
@arvidkahl @jessievbreugel @alicellemee @AlexLlullTW Thank you!
@pedr0luna @LazerFocus_ I’ve heard really good things about the course @arvidkahl created about building an audience.
@AdamVazquez Thank you, Adam!
@NicolasHoferer @imjameskonn Build an audience.
@Nicolascole77 Sometimes I literally cannot tell what people are selling.
@optimalcoco It certainly helps to have a skill that you can monetize, but I've seen people get awfully creative!
@imjameskonn Best of luck!
@KeanoCT By becoming well-known for doing a specific thing.
@Nicolascole77 Certainly one I'm not going to miss.
@monaddevs I'm raking it in.
@MeAtasu Every business is dependent on many things.
@matt_gray_ Appreciate you, man!
@LazerFocus_ Become known for something. Talk about stuff you know and attract other people who are interested in learning more.
@KarlKaufmanADI Become known for something by sharing your thoughts.
@ImraneSubstack Nice! We all start at $0.
@_hancity By building an audience around a product or service that you can use to help people.
@ManjhunathRavi Pretty wild times.
Using Twitter, you can go from $0 online to $100k in one year.  - No career path - No daily meetings - No "can I have a raise?" - No performance reviews - No, "we don't have the budget"  Just heads down for 12 months.  A predictable system.   And uncapped earning potential.
@dklineii @abhishekshah173 Appreciate it!!
@theranwy 100%.
@writingtoriches Existential pain.
@austinbelcak Same!
@TMitrosilis These are awesome, Teddy.
@matt_gray_ Love that, Matt.
@matt_gray_ Point number one is so critical. Angry decisions are almost always wrong decisions.   Thanks for the mention here, Matt. Cheers.
@heydarmen Well, then you're talking to the wrong person.   This advice is certainly much more helpful when you're speaking to the prospective buyer.
@sankalpdomore @arvidkahl @MeetKevon I write and publish in Hypefury.
@darentsmith Yes. This!
@gauravsingh961 Yep. If you have a problem, it's likely other people will as well.
@SachinRamje Nailed it,  Sachin.
@blairmacgregor Try this:  https://t.co/qlRoWouTPT
@EvergreenMEP Way too hard.
@MuhammadShan_ Welcome!
@VinayKrKatiyar The world convinced people it's a must.
@TothSebastien Yep.
@heywarco Godin is a smart man.
@imjameskonn I presell. If people buy, I build. If they don't, I don't.  Twitter and LinkedIn are great ways to figure out.
@blairmacgregor Pain levels during discovery.  P1: Technical pain P2: Historical pain P3: Financial pain P4: Personal pain  The deeper you go, the better off you are.
@abhishekshah173 Presell to your existing audience. If nobody buys, don't build it.
@hey_dhruv That's exactly right, Dhruv.
@luke_netti 100%. You can't just assume people want what you have. Signals.
A mistake I see solopreneurs making:  Selling products for problems they haven't validated.  - No real problem - No real urgency - No real pain  Remember that pain is an indicator of purchase.  "Nice to have" doesn't sell much.
@dickiebush Smart shift...
@thisiskp_ Yes. Having the right balance without being too hypercritical of oneself is definitely key. Good call out.
@dickiebush This is awesome.  And I'm definitely loving this format.   Note to self: Do this.
@ken_carroll Yep. These people just tend to fade away after time, especially in a work environment.
@Kunal_KumarJ It makes fixing it much easier, Kunal.
@iammosesaboh Always, Moses.
@iamvikeshtiwari Yep. If it's always on you, you get the power to fix it.
@WritesToFreedom 100%, Armaan. Great point.
@swaycopy That's not weird at all. It's how you get better.
@TothSebastien Of course. But if it's always someone else's fault...
@hey_dhruv They'll definitely become clearer.
If it's always someone else's fault, it's probably your fault.
@jessievbreugel Appreciate it, Jessie!

@vishakhak29 Thanks!
@AuthorVenkatesh I built it myself on Kajabi using a theme.
@heykatgarcia Awesome! Congrats, Kat :)
@CoxDigitalcl Thank you so much!
@DgtlMike To the newsletter? It takes about 45 minutes to write.  Another 15-30 minutes to edit.  And 20 minutes to get it all set up to send.
@ChristineCarril Thanks, Christine!
@greg_wair It's very freeing. Outside of a VA, I don't plan on expanding. Plus, I don't want to scale. I want to make the same and work less.
@landforce Yeah. I submitted a request for review 4 days ago and nothing yet. I think I can probably find a workaround, but glad to know it's still working for you. Appreciate you sharing.
@mattmylin Knowing that I have valuable information to share.
@landforce It says I need to fill out some survey to ask for permission. Maybe I'm just missing something?
@prestesonline Welcome! Thanks for reading.
@UnleashTheKnow_ Kajabi
@dch625 Thank you, David!
@HandsAreDiamond Yes, I prewrite each weekend.
@theandreboso I'll be doing quite a bit of research, but I believe Kajabi has this built in.
@iamvikeshtiwari @theandreboso Perfect timing!
@SullyBusiness Much appreciated, Bryant. Your weekend time is valuable, so thanks for giving me some of yours.
@josiahfitness I love hearing that, Josiah. Thank you!
@theandreboso I'm gonna try it out...
@TeshyT5 I'm not sure, but I'd expect it was a bit of both.
@TheMeerShahid Thanks, Meer!
@karanontheline That's my thought process for sure, Karan.
@PaulElijas Thanks so much for spending your valuable time reading it, Paul. I appreciate it.
@dickiebush Thanks so much for that, man. Means the world.
@EvergreenMEP Get after it, Greg!
@HandsAreDiamond Very well.
@darrenchait @elonmusk I love keeping it simple.  No acronyms. No chance for things to get lost to confusion.  Explain things like you might to a child and communication suddenly gets more crisp.
@HandsAreDiamond A broad range that eventually was whittled down over time.
@natolisnuggets It sure is, man.
@MikeYing77 Thanks, Mike!
@MarketingMax They're in the issue:  https://t.co/JElqOQ5D08  Really simple stuff.
@DrewSpeaksGoat Thanks. Lol.
@blakeaburge Thank you, sir!
@LoganBrownSWS Not sticking to my original promise of delivering, then ghosting, then shutting it down completely.
@getcabana Sweet. LMK what you think.
@Phil_MWAi Heck yeah, Phil!
@AuthorOnTheSide I do repost, but I don't wait. I'm not trying to game the system. Just really trying to offer it up as people want to consume it.
@dickiebush Same, my man.
@natolisnuggets Congrats, Ant!
@brendancahill_ Haha.
@hey_dhruv I sure hope so. Thanks for the kind words, Dhruv!
@heysachit Thank you!
@theinspiringco_ Ha. Thank you.
@Nicolascole77 Ain't it though? So many people try, fail, quit.  Instead, try, fail, learn, pivot, try again.
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
// Today's issue  Today, I broke down those 5 places in my newest issue.  Nothing complicated.  No "hacks".  Just simple places that I overlooked, and see many others missing.  If you have a newsletter (or want to start one), read today's issue:  https://t.co/JElqOQ5D08
5/ Marketed more effectively  There are so many places to market a newsletter.  But in my first go-round, I missed some pretty obvious ones.  This time, I nailed 5 places my readers are already hanging out and consuming my content.  That helped subscriber growth fly.
4/ Made it consumable  People are oversubscribed to newsletters.  So many newsletters are too long. Very few are too short.  Mine can always be read in less than 4 minutes and the lessons can be applied immediately.  That's my promise.
3/ Clear outcome  Everywhere I market my newsletter, I'm clear about what readers will get.  One tip to grow your online audience and business each week.  No fluff. No nebulous, repurposed stuff.  Just tactical tips that have actually worked for the person writing it: me
1/ Focused audience  I chose to focus on one specific avatar: solopreneurs  Generally, solopreneurs are growing their businesses online via content marketing and social media.  So, this makes it easy for me to deliver tactical lessons that I know will resonate.
18 months ago, I started my first email newsletter.  I failed miserably and quit.  Then 90 days ago, I tried again and have grown it to 21,163 subscribers.  Here are 5 simple things I did differently:  🧵
@dickiebush I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I'm 100x more creative when I hit my morning walk with my wife.  We do 5-6 miles and the sheer number of ideas that come from that time is incredible.  When I miss, I struggle to create.
@FullHarbor Thanks for sharing my thread, Austin. Much appreciated.
@jonbrosio @DavidZabinsky @MakadiaHarsh @dickiebush @heyeaslo @heyblake Thank you, man!
@wordsbysusmita No secrets! Just simple things I missed the first time around.
@alexkonewko @justin Nice work, Alex!
@PaulElijas There isn’t one.
@luisalfbar Thanks man!
@matt_gray_ All simple stuff. Nothing too flashy!
@delisle_domain I appreciate that, Jay.

@Praadigi @samanthademers @hugh_dawkins @MakadiaHarsh @khemaridh @ModestMitkus @capt_nandu Thank you!
@austinbelcak I feel this, 100%. So true.
@Pawan_Ethics Exactly, Pawan. Nice work, man,.
@LoganBrownSWS That's for sure. James Clear style.
@ChaseArbeiter Thanks so much, Chase 🙌
@copywithkush That's the game, Kushagra.
@KurtisHanni Haha. This is so so true.
@sethcapital1 Love that!
@ArmaanWritess That’s why I do it.
@ArmaanWritess @ItsKieranDrew Go for it. I’d watch.
@luke_netti Same here, Luke.
@caitmackcs One of my favorite quotes
@navdeepsoni Definitely.
@hey_dhruv That’s it, my man.
@AuthorOnTheSide Awesome, Hassan!
@7Printz Yep. It’s uphill work for awhile then downhill once systems are in place.
@omarakhaddaj That’s exactly it.
@matt_gray_ always. These are the steps.
@matt_gray_ Great thread, Matt. Well written, and terrific takeaways. Cheers.
@dickiebush Great essay, Dickie. I'm pretty similar here. My first 3 hours are coffee and walking, followed by 2 hours of creating. 5 hours well planned.
Solopreneurs can't rely on work ethic.  Instead:  - Eliminate what you can - Automate as much as possible - Build out systems for leftover work - Execute your systems every single day  Motivation eventually falters.  Systems rarely do.

@Nicolascole77 Such a great thread, man. It gives me a lot to think about at the perfect time as I think about scaling...  Thank you.
What's a book that changed how you work?
@swaycopy I love that, Josh.
@CheetSheets Ha. Funny how that works.
@ken_carroll There are definitely outstanding people, but most people are average action-takers.
@PoonamSonawane_ It sure does.
@IsaiahAscher I guess he said it better :)
@TMitrosilis They certainly are, Teddy.
@AlizaKr Lol.
@caitmackcs Exactly. Action and execution.
@eitan_levy101 Absolutely. I've found this to be true as recently as yesterday.
@TomLibelt Same.
@NinaGreimel Take action and join them.
@wenser2010 Yes. Everyone is the hero.
@theo__jn That's a good mantra.
@Jayyanginspires This is exactly what I figured out.
@serenaded_ Very much so.
@hey_dhruv That's it, Dhruv.
The most mind-bending, freedom-inducing realization I've ever had is that my heroes are average people.
@franulovicm @theandreboso @arvidkahl @AlessandraEsse Boom! Get after it, Marino. Welcome 👋
@luisantoniomata Definitely. Once you remember it all ends, you can really start living.
@amzfreelancer 100%. Free.
@BradSpencer Amen.
@JustinCourte Always, Justin.
@CoryGearrin Thank you, sir.
@LearningCraig Exactly.
@clintavo I want to do what I want, when I want, with whom I want.
@sheedss99 It really does, Rashidah.
@ArmaanWritess Thanks, Armaan.
@DevLinguistic Same, my man.
@xGoKiickRockszx Nailed it, Nancy.
If your great career means a terrible personal life, you're hustling in reverse.
@leanderhowardii Congrats, Leander!
@jonbrosio Really nice work here, Jon. Thanks for including me. I've bookmarked this for later. Cheers
@LaurenDevoll Appreciate it, Lauren!
@gregyounger Thanks, Greg!
@Nicolascole77 Number 2 (taxing yourself) is something I’ve been doing for years. Helped me establish a great pattern of financial responsibility. Love these man.
@dickiebush Best daily habit I’ve ever picked up. Great stuff here man!
@matt_gray_ Hit singles. One day you'll swing for one and accidentally hit a home run,.
@RainbowSteps Here I am 👋
@thenocodepro Ha. Very true, man.
@TaniaDiscovered Love this comment, Tania. You're absolutely right.
@CheetSheets I'm not actually sure, to be honest. I want to build my business around myself, so that's why I choose to be non-anonymous.
@ken_carroll Say 1 thing 1,000 ways.
@drernestomd Thanks, Dr. E. Great points by you.
@createtoimpact Exactly, Parker.
@AuthorOnTheSide Top of mind, top of wallet.
@bresslertweets Photoshop!
@lexpaval Talk about what you learn. See what resonates. Double down. Repeat.
@hey_dhruv No "zero" days as James Clear would say.
@henwalkco Be present and in front daily.
Solopreneurs don't need viral content.  Marketing is about getting on base every day.  - Familiar face - Familiar name - Familiar content - Familiar opinions  It's cliché as hell but play Moneyball.
@iamalexjames93 Thanks, Alex!
@YvonneHappy Thanks for the nice breakdown here, Yvonne.  You're damn sharp - this is basically how I thought about it, step-by-step.  Great work 🔥
@GunnarHabitz Thanks, Gunnar!
@tushar_raven @copywithkush Thanks Kushagra 🙌
@iFirebrand These tactics will help you get that traction and momentum. Add in some smart commenting and you're well on your way.
@imThomasMorales Appreciate it, Thomas!

@JoshFromCMG It's social media, so I like to socialize. Ya know?
@lordZombi I'll take it.
@TMitrosilis @natolisnuggets Thanks for being such an awesome supporter.
@LaurenVriens That's great! Keep going!
@LoganBrownSWS Appreciate it, Logan. 🙌
@capt_nandu Thanks, Nandu!
@hermanvaswrites Thanks, Herman!
@benjleroublard And I appreciate that, Benj. Thank you.
@jonbrosio Love that. I called it "aggregation" I think (or maybe I missed it).  I do this with lists of great no-code tools I've discovered.
@robertbalazsi Thanks, Robert!
@omarakhaddaj @dickiebush Exactly.
@MJmeetstheworld @dickiebush It's certainly more helpful to believe you can than to believe you can't.  Doesn't mean you have to try. But the belief, IMO, is necessary.
@dickiebush Hell yeah it is.
@GhazanfarIqbal For me it was around 30k or so...
@heywarco This is awesome. Thank you!
@tweetsbyejordan Love those 3 E's.
@dickiebush Just trying to be the next Dickie.
@blakeaburge Just out here trying to catch you!
@_DanMottram @ship30for30 Appreciate that, Daniel. Means the world, man.

@Jayyanginspires Keep going at it, man!
@The_Policymaker 📈
@tomberryCD Welcome, Tom!
@noorg420 Tryin!
@Jayyanginspires Yep.
@ryanstruck @Nicolascole77 Sorry about that.
@CarveQueen They are all there...
@Creator_Coach @typeshare_co  https://t.co/QS9PoXSPvs
@JoeHolka 💣
@HeyJimBurgess Haha. Thanks, Jim.  My goal is "be everywhere".
@rehacks_ Appreciate you :)
@Nicolascole77 Write 'em. Analyze 'em. Reuse 'em.
@beingcaokhanh Thank you for spending some time reading it. Cheers.
@SahilBloom Appreciate it, man. Easy to follow, easy to implement.
@drernestomd @emihartung Thanks, man. Glad it resonated.
@hey_dhruv That's exactly it, my man.
@hey_dhruv Thanks, my man!
Well, that's a wrap!  I hope you got some value out of this thread and can apply some of these learnings immediately.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
8/ Ask people a question  You'd be surprised by how excited people are to share their opinion.  Whenever I ask a simple question, I get an incredible amount of engagement.  Here's a question I asked that shocked me with the number of responses.   https://t.co/TBOgeGVUbR
7/ Answer people's questions  One of the easiest ways to get new followers is by making yourself available.  Whenever I'm on a train or plane, I like to take some time and run an AMA.  Here's a recent one about Twitter growth that resonated:   https://t.co/XzV35WYm6f
6/ Motivate people  Many folks are on Twitter because they want to improve their lives.  So motivation works to get people to lean in and read your content.  I like to combine motivation with education to pump people up and then show them how it's done.   https://t.co/3zVqEe0ggx
5/ Aggregate for people  One trend is collecting helpful information for people in one place.  For example, I use no-code tools to build my one-person businesses.  And I had a hypothesis that people would be interested in my favorite tools.  I was right.   https://t.co/hfEVo5oV6V
4/ Support other people  Supporting other people is a cheat code on Twitter.  I generally do this through commenting.  It helps me foster strong relationships with interesting people across the world.  If you want to grow, start doing this.  https://t.co/1iEPZoJ9Mp
3/ Make people think  I like to use copywriting &amp; wordplay to make people think.  And with limited attention spans, doing that in the shortest amount of characters can be powerful.  Here's an example of a "wordplay" Tweet that made people think.   https://t.co/5pSdSVYpDE
2/ Entertain  If you educate 100% of the time, you run the risk of boring the reader.  Once you bore your audience, you get tuned out.   This is where entertainment comes in.  For example, this tweet helped me add nearly 500 followers.   https://t.co/FP6sw2PUhM
1/ Teach or educate  You can start by sharing your expertise in a tactical way.  For example, I shared my 4-step writing process in this thread.  It's tactical and teaches people something they can use right away.   https://t.co/NxMdQiFKch
A Twitter audience is a massive asset.   I've added 52,437 Twitter followers in 90 days.  Here are 8 types of content that made the biggest impact:  [Thread 🧵]
@IAmCoachClint Great stuff here, man!  Thanks for including me, Coach.
@tdinh_me @blackmagic_so Glad it helped bring awareness to an awesome tool!
@_DanMottram @ship30for30 Great stuff, man!
@zachweismann @craigburgess I misread the original post, sorry.  I do recaps and lessons from things I've actually done.  Most people are like "I looked at 7,496 websites in the last 30 days and here are my takeaways."   I just don't do that stuff. That's
@_IlirAliu @JakubPiskor @euboid Thanks, man!
@dickiebush Mindset is a wild thing. Part of my success is just believing I can do anything. Literally anything I want. Run for mayor? Yep. Make $5M? Yep. Run a a marathon? Yep.   Maybe I’ll do none of them but I feel like I can.
@polak_jasper I'm glad it resonated!@
@austinbelcak Killer thread, man. For those folks who want to land big opps, this one is a must.
@ebizfacts @GergelyOrosz Thanks for featuring me!
@ItsKieranDrew Certainly does, my man.
@matt_gray_ Thank you, Matt!
@PhilJ0606 Time to think about it :)
@TMitrosilis Yes. It's "passive" but still requires content creation, so it's the outcome of work (that makes it less so).
@AuthorOnTheSide Oh for sure!
@BigBadKale Thank you, sir.
@iamvikeshtiwari That's right. Love it, Vikesh.
@RazaCute I was previously an executive at a tech company. Now I make a living as a creator.
@creation247 Damn. That's where it's at, man. Nice work. Love your account, FYI. Cheers.
@Matt_Mastando Appreciate it, Matthew.
@hustlenconquer Always.
@lexpaval Definitely! I agree with that 100.
@omarakhaddaj This 👆🏻
@copywithkush Thanks, Kushagra!
@aurasky_ No jealousy needed. I'm just a few years ahead on the journey. Enjoy it!
@omarakhaddaj @gauravsingh961 People too often think of entrepreneurship as extremely risky. I dipped my toe in before taking the dive.  I wish more people would try it that way.
@hey_dhruv 100%, Dhruv.
My raises as an employee:  2017: 4% 2018: 5% 2019: 7%  My raises as a solopreneur:  2020: 10% 2021: 40% 2022: 95% (Proj)  Don't ask for a raise. Create one.
@SimonHoiberg @FeedHive_io I'm literally looking at the website right now.   Will sign up for a free trial today and check it out. Thanks, Simon.
@zachweismann @craigburgess I don’t ever do this.

@mattsimondesign @nick__pattison @ecomchasedimond Thanks, Matt!
@SeanPHogue I do the same!
@IAmRobGee @BrandonFluharty Thanks, Robert!
@imThomasMorales Not as much as I'd like. This post is a reminder to myself.
@juanlanteri Not yet.
@KathrynEriksen1 Thank you, Kathryn!
@kharp04 To learn about other cultures which increases your empathy and the likelihood that you understand other people.
@eitan_levy101 100% it is.
@guerrist Greetings!
@polak_jasper Haha.
@iamchriswoelk Zilch.
@heykav Thank you, Krishna.
@ifdanieldid_ No need.
@ArmaanWritess Love it, Armaan.
@madsbrodt Money makes everyone's life easier, and therefore easier to help everyone else.
Make money, stay healthy, help people, love your family, and travel the world.  Everything else is a dog and pony show.
@esanteralli @swaycopy @amandanat I don't think so, no.   It's because the platform is starving for good creators. So many consumers, so few creators with high-quality content.   That's just my take. I could be very wrong.
@SeanPHogue Definitely. That's why I create for one and distribute to all others. But I've been doing this for 3 years.
@fred_klaviyopro @writingtoriches @gumroad That's so awesome to hear. Thanks, man!
@swaycopy @amandanat It's easier to stand out with less followers on LinkedIn.   The more followers you accrue on the Twitter, the much faster you can grow (significantly faster than LI).
@natolisnuggets Congrats, Anthony! Glad I could be helpful in some small way 🙌🏻
@dickiebush I love reading @sivers    I think my favorite part of How to Live is he intentionally flip flops on nearly every topic, presenting a good argument for multiple takes on one thought.
@luke_netti @BrandonFluharty Much appreciated, man!
@eikom  https://t.co/4DE2jPNXme
@ThusSpokeRahul Nope. Just ran out of characters.
@moimaere I know @sparktoro is a great tool for finding where your audience hangs.
@bresslertweets I'm not sure. I still think LinkedIn is the most underused, content-starved channel there is. I'd probably do the same.
@matt_gray_ @SahilBloom @gregisenberg @ShaanVP @JamesClear Thank you, Matt! Massive appreciation.
@MichelleCaira Definitely.
@Max_Stevens6 @desoprotocol Ahh. Gotcha. I'm not smart enough to know what that is 😂
@MichelleCaira They may not be. If they aren't, don't bother. For many people though, they are.
@JasonRBradwell 100%, Jason.
@imjameskonn Definitely. But not for social posting.
@Max_Stevens6 @desoprotocol Interesting. I'll have to learn more.
@hey_dhruv That's right, Dhruv.
Solopreneur distribution:  - TikTok - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - YouTube - HackerNews - Indie Hackers - Facebook Groups - Private Slack/Discord  If you create once, might as well scale distribution.  Different customers hang in different channels.
@jafrog Now THAT is funny.
@eikom 私を含めてくれてありがとう！
@andyjackcandle @ChrisBadgett @ship30for30 Lots of ways to make the online world work. Just gotta test 'em all.

@emihartung Thanks for reading it, Emilie.
@keywordchampion True story.
@MayankJ IMO, yes.
@AuthorVenkatesh 1. IMO people care about information quality vs. production quality  2. I use simple landing pages because it doesn't complicate the buyer.
@alokvani Thank you, Alok!
@amyvanwinkle @omarakhaddaj As someone who helps people do this for a living, I can promise you that most people do not understand this process.
@ChaseArbeiter @brodydoes Thank you, Chase!
@imhyderkhan Yep. Attention is the key.
@ByteBound Parkinson's Law.
@sladeerickson Definitely. Nailed it, Slade.
@wpjaguar Create content online that makes you worth following.
@sarg_io @webflow @Pepper_Content Totally.
@cslukwago Haha. I'm just writing to myself. That's the secret.
@TheAmineAouragh Exactly, Amine.
@TMitrosilis Yep.
@SachinRamje Boom. Love it, Sachin!
@HaydnMartin_ Attention.
@joe_portsmouth Great stuff! Thanks for including me 🙌🏻
@OscarLagrosen Momentum ftw.
@omarakhaddaj I believe this as well, Omara. Great point.
@realjondavids Haha. It can certainly be more complicated, but this is the easiest way to start.
@dickiebush Nailed it. Get the momentum going with crisp simplicity.
@caseystamper57 @BrianFOConnor @heyeaslo @SahilBloom @blakeaburge @ship30for30 Go grab ‘em. 😉
@JustinCourte Keep it simple. Get complicated later.
@mzaragozas Yep. Most good things are tough to do well.
@eitan_levy101 Table stakes.
@eitan_levy101 Attention is marketing.
@iamvikeshtiwari Timebox it to a certain number of days.
@dsvaughncsp Thanks, Scott!
@blakeaburge @naval Thanks so much for including me, Blake!
@iamsimm0 @SahilBloom Great minds 🧠
What you need to start earning money online:  - Attention - A landing page - A good product/service - A way to accept payment  That’s about it.  Resist the urge to overcomplicate.
@EliasArriazola Awesome!
@BrianFOConnor @heyeaslo @SahilBloom @blakeaburge Looking fwd to getting your feedback, Brian. Cheers (and thanks for being a customer!)
@jasonstrimpel @RealJapricott I don't mind!
@dickiebush Tons of info packed in here, Dickie. Bookmarked for future writing sessions. Cheers, man.
@esmiffz Repurpose your Twitter stuff to LinkedIn. It will work extremely well.
Solopreneurship is about managing emotions.  - Don't get amped by $15k days. - Don't get depressed by $0 days.  Slow and steady, 1% better each day.
@samjshore So glad to see this. I've been a happy Typeshare user for almost 6 months now.  My newsletter, thread ideas, templates. Such a great tool. Keep going, Sam!
@leagiltjes Nice, Lea!
@feelthebyrn1 Thank you so much, Gordo!
@blakeaburge I'm here to support you 🔥
@coachgmuncy @helenleemoon Thank you, Gabby!
@blakeaburge @SahilBloom Damn, man. I thought I was good at Excel! These are awesome. Can't wait to use some of them...
@AdamSinger Yeah, plus Reddit is so nasty. LinkedIn is quite friendly.
@helenleemoon @coachgmuncy Nice work, Helen 💪
@AdamSinger Gotcha!  -# of new connections: 7,174  -Revenue: Nearly impossible to attribute given I make sales all day long, but did about $18,750 within 72 hours of the post.  -Inbound opportunities: I don't do anything that would constitute "inbound lea
@AdamSinger When you say outcomes, what do you mean exactly? I want to make sure I understand the question.   Do you mean revenue?
@SahilBloom Thanks, man!
@mycarlwright I'm not sure. I haven't really tried. Anything is possible with good content. Experiment!
@noah_ifergan All my posts are basically experiments on what resonates with people.
@cslukwago Thanks, Charles!
@vshvrdhn Thank you so much!
@drernestomd Haha. Thanks, man.
@nordinahn That's my goal, so I'm glad to hear it's resonating.
@OscarLagrosen 100% do it.
@digtoolsonline I'll take it.
@Rarelyonmakeup Thanks for reading it!
I wrote a LinkedIn post with the intention of going viral.  Virality is almost never my goal, but I decided to try.  Here are the Results:  - 4.766M+ impressions - 50,583 engagements - 1,444 comments - 1,589 shares  Here's how I wrote it:  https://t.co/I0QSlr9xrN
@austinbelcak Number 2 is so important. So much "connect and ask" in the world.

@hustlenconquer That's correct.
@dickiebush Appreciate you, man...
@tweetsbyejordan @dickiebush @OneJKMolina @ash_lmb Thanks, man!
@tweetsbyejordan @thealexbanks Agree 100%. The problem is that Twitter has labeled LinkedIn as "uncool" so people let their ego get in the way rather than just going over and opening up a new 6-figure channel.  My secret sauce is that I don't care what pe
@tweetsbyejordan Can't wait to share it.
@MakadiaHarsh Thanks, Harsh!
@thealexbanks It's just another place to grow and build a network.
@SahilBloom Right back at ya.
@michaelkirsten More space for us!
@OscarLagrosen That's one way to do it!
@Nicolascole77 Agreed. Each has their pros/cons.
@TheMoney_Wizard Can't wait to send it out.
@SahilBloom I'm watching you grow like wildfire there. More folks on their way over.
Twitter hates LinkedIn.  But some of the biggest Twitter names are publishing there daily.  Because engagement is off the charts.  Tomorrow, I'm going to break down the anatomy of my highest performing LinkedIn post.  Join 19,227 subscribers here:  https://t.co/vCOnWlle21
@henwalkco Nailed it.
@gabbart_ You can do lots of things in a few hours. But the success is miles away.
@henwalkco Remain*
@henwalkco Yup. Note it. Take it down. But, ultimately remind focused on your mission if you feel you have the right data to move.
@CheetSheets It's great you recognized and pivoted though! Most people can't say the same.
@extoldirector Love this, Michael.
@johnherrington Yep! Build for the long term and win.
@SachinRamje Dude. You're killing it. Keep going, brother!
@Brett_Trainor Never does.
@voidabhi True story.
@LoganBrownSWS Yep. But everyone is picking up every rock trying to find some hidden key.
@EvergreenMEP @agarwal__gaurav @barrettjoneill @joe_portsmouth @bbourque @dklineii @AliTheCFO @KurtisHanni @thealexbanks @wolfejosh @blakeaburge @dickiebush @sweatystartup @Codie_Sanchez Thank you, Greg!
@EvergreenMEP Same :)
@Brett_Trainor But everyone tries.
@SachinRamje Like you. Look at your growth, my man...32k? WOW. Loving watching you fly here.
@MikeYing77 Play it and win.
@BigBadKale Always.
@EvergreenMEP I just want to be standing when most aren't.
Everyone is looking for a shortcut, so the short game is fierce.  Playing the long game is significantly less crowded.
@amzfreelancer  https://t.co/hfEVo5oV6V

@Nicolascole77 Love that. Also, realize that most people you admire are impostors in some way, shape, or form. Every great person I talk to feels it.
@ManjhunathRavi @ship30for30 Definitely they will.
@sterespect Maybe. Maybe not.
@therealjsega  https://t.co/JOjhGtcXmr
@Alex_LifeStyles Ha. I love this.
@CCollinsDC It's a winging it world.
@JoshFromCMG I don't know what this means, but I like it.
@jryankennedy I think so too.
@polak_jasper Everyone is just playing the game.
@MentalWeapons Always.
The best way to deal with impostor syndrome is to realize everyone is an impostor.
@hastakshar Too kind. When I come to Mumbai, I will DM you.
@hastakshar Sunbasket :)
@pradologue Definitely.
@WealthProfits Always.
@chrisfreder I don't think this is true at all.
@CSMikeCardona @Natalie_Furn Yes, definitely. I like to assume that the folks I write for know that automating crappy things just brings you more crap at scale.
@e_stradella Yep.
@salesystemsB2B Nailed it.
@thenocodepro If you spend 2 hours and the task takes 2 minutes, at 60 tasks, you're in the green.
@MarkPraschan I like that. As much as I love productivity, I wasn't aware of this one.
If you've done it twice, automate it.
@dikshayaar @amanpreet_27 @SahilBloom @warikoo @NiharikaSodhi Thank you!
@mikefutia Depends. If you want a publishing tool, go Hypefury. If you want to understand your analytics deeply, go BlackMagic.
@NinaGreimel The bigger the pain, the better.
@forwardincption 100% it is.
@TMitrosilis Thank you, my man :)
@theavoboy @jjxe_ I love that.
@sladeerickson Exactly. We focus on one post instead of the aggregate.
@Pirzada23 Journaling, observations, systems, daily life, etc.
@hermanvaswrites Agreed, Herman.
@joshcervone Yep. Discipline makes winners.
@CoryGearrin Appreciate it, Cory.
@JoeHolka Always have the longest view.
@thisisming Smart comment, Christopher.
@dklineii Right? Even if I got very little in terms of "engagement" the clarity it provides my mind is priceless.
@ItsKieranDrew Wow. That's an awesome story, Kieran. Love it, man!
@ChinwokeNnamani Always. Long game over everything.
@Rarelyonmakeup So much better daily.
@EvergreenMEP Agreed 100%, Greg.
I've written every day for 3+ years now.  - Sometimes people love it. - Sometimes people hate it. - Sometimes people ignore it.  You know what?  Doesn't matter.  Publishing my thoughts leads to internal growth.

Solopreneurship isn't about a great idea.  It's about attracting people and delivering value.  average idea + great marketing + quality delivery = a viable business
It's amazing how many average people make incredible money simply because they believe in themselves.
@writingtoriches Feel the same. Big goal energy.
@Yannick_Veys @blackhatwizardd @JamesonCamp Great stuff man. Thanks for including me. Much appreciated. 👏

@Steve_P_Brady Love it dude.
Solopreneurship is simple.  Things you don’t need:  - Tons of money - 100k+ followers - A college degree - A blue checkmark - The perfect tech stack - 10+ years of experience  Things you do need:  - Engaged audience around one topic - A problem worth solving - A solution
@jspector Complaining about everyone else instead of curating a better feed.

@ManjhunathRavi Definitely. Just by publishing daily, I've exposed myself to so many opportunities.
@thenocodepro Hit singles every day.
@jonbrosio 100%. Test and analyze constantly.
@khemaridh Dude, amazing! I love seeing growth stories like this. Congrats, Khe. Let's get connected for real in the next few weeks or so.
Most solopreneurs misunderstand content.  It's not about daily virality attempts.  It's about having thousands of your thoughts in the ecosystem at any moment in time.  1000+ pieces working hard on your behalf.  So, publish frequently.   Because you never know what resonates.
@DevprakashSahoo It sure does, Dev.
@eitan_levy101 Exactly, Eitan.

@ADHDJobs  https://t.co/KpC0zQv7SO
@drernestomd Same man!
@ManjhunathRavi I presell. Doesn’t mean you have to, but I think it’s worth it.
Simple solopreneurs win.  1% go from idea to MVP in a day.  99% get stuck:  - Trying to find the coolest domain name - Crowdsourcing opinions from strangers - Running polls to pick the "right" software - Designing a logo before they have anything to sell  Ship. Then complicate.
@tdinh_me 👋
@NotechAna I generally ignore, “aggressive knowledge” where people are overly confident in delivering knowledge that is extremely contextual.
@luke_netti We all know more about something than someone else though!
@_nicolaporter @jspector Thank you!

@PaulElijas I think it can be, yes.  That's because Twitter can be such a different platform based on what you want to accomplish.  It's curated pretty darn well.
@MeetKevon Thanks so much, Kevin!
@Josh_Ebner If you focus more on your core area, you'll grow faster.
@LoganBrownSWS  https://t.co/IJVfpewYMz
@SalesWiseFran Engage in conversations with high-quality accounts.
@MgnoliaTitanium You can use. SparkToro or Followerwonk, but it's mostly just involving yourself in the conversation and getting to know people who matter.
@Simona_road Nah. Mine was dormant for 10 years.
@SachinRamje Thank you, my man. Right back at you. You've been growing like crazy.
@thisiskp_ @briansowards I realized I missed one of your Q’s. I produced threads each Tuesday when I started but have fallen off lately because of travel. Plan on getting back to it soon.
@CSMikeCardona Everyone has multiple interests. When we're starting out, it's good to be known as someone who delivers a specific message time in and time out. Nice work, Mike!
@briansowards @thisiskp_ Great questions (and thanks for following, KP).  I usually take two sittings to produce a thread. One to write it, one to edit it.  I schedule nearly everything. It's my full-time job so I have the privilege of being able to spend
@MaxBramwell I do, but usually as an LP only. I've made a few angel investments on my own, but mostly into companies run by people I know well.

@castle_bridges Thanks! Just bored on the train :)
@ChaseArbeiter Thank you so much, Chase! I appreciate Tweets like this that let me know my newsletter is resonating. Cheers, bud.
@warrenthehuman I use my calendar to schedule out all important tasks for my business, of which content is one of them.
@timothyjacque 1. Design a profile worth following  2. Share a very useful tip each day  3. Engage with 3-5 high-value accounts with incredibly helpful comments  4. Write one Tweet thread per week showing how you think at a very deep level.
@braden_mosley On LinkedIn? Because they punish links.
@HustleJoy Daily life, journaling, questions from my audience, looking back at old content, courses, blogs I read, etc.
@_SchusterDev Brevity. Everything has to be shorter and punchier.
@thenocodepro I'd figure out one first, and then hit the 2nd.
@coreymlevine How does everything I create work together in harmony to help my business grow faster?
@TMitrosilis Interestingly enough, there is very little difference.   Twitter requires better writing because of character limitations.
@coreymlevine Talk about things you've figured out if your life that other people desperately want to figure out. The rest happens naturally.
@noah_ifergan Definitely have a system.  You should spend some time on my website. Tons of free information around systems:  https://t.co/64c9clqIuz
@braden_mosley 1. Be clear aka profile optimization  2. Give people a specific reason - like very specific.  3. Help other people to grow and you'll help yourself.
@feelthebyrn1 @blackmagic_so Thanks, man. Sometimes I feel very unproductive, so just know that :)
@coreymlevine How to tie all of the different platforms together in a cohesive way.
@coreymlevine I'm not sure. I do all of my own digital marketing.
@gabbart_ A simple one: carve out time and respond to things I'm generally interested in.
@undervalu That people are nasty.
@feelthebyrn1 @blackmagic_so I haven't. I could though.
@BrandonArvay It amlost always starts with value. It snowballs with hype. Aka: the rich get richer.
@gus_tiffer Definitely not. I just started about 5 months ago.
@CheetSheets By talking about specific things and helping them find me.
@HustleJoy Wine.
@BrandonArvay It's definitely everywhere. Online is a lot like offline. Offline, the same things happen at work.
@Hunckler I DM almost zero. I hate anything other than email :)
@undervalu Hip hop.
@RobbiRavi Thanks, Ravi!
@gabbart_ In the beginning, conversations helped me grow more.  Now, my own Tweets do.  I carve out time on my calendar to do both.
@undervalu Replies.
@HustleJoy I just like sharing things that I think of, but we're all influenced by what we read.
@yytambaya_ Easy to prove you wrong.  Lots of people consistently Tweet, have patience, and never grow a following. There ya go,.
@adewole_gs @HustleJoy There's no hack.  They just learn how to write and share information that other people desperately want to know.  It's information they understand that other people don't.
@undervalu I don't write that many to begin with, but maybe.
@mvarghese5 Thank you, man!
@ArpitMutha7 I don't actually remember. It was probably back in 2014.
@_VersatyleStyle They are one in the same.
@HustleJoy I don't agree with it 100%, no. I think it's helpful to be deeper in your career, but we all have knowledge that helps other people.  There are a lot of young kids (14-17) that have huge followings on here.
@CoachShaneA I'm going from Edinburgh, Scotland to London
@BrandonArvay I think it's taking complex principles and making them much more simple. At least, that's the feedback I get from my audience.

@MusaMussaddiq Sure thing
@takaokubo @maxwellcdavis Roughly, yes.
@EcomSimo I have a lot of questions to answer, so won't choose 10, but here are some that come to mind:  @dvassallo  @jackbutcher  @dickiebush  @Nicolascole77
@Ethan_Mick Either can work. Test them out and see what resonates. Double down on whichever does.
@web3paloma Probably one of these two.  1.  https://t.co/6ut5J0KHLg  2.  https://t.co/D3kOWfHoW6
@EcomSimo Around 20k I started growing much, much faster.
@zachtalkswealth Once I made about $10k, I opened an LLC. Doesn't mean it's the right answer, but it's what I did.
@ImraneSubstack Right now, I'm learning about using a VA really effectively. We all learn stuff every single day.
@ModestMitkus Thanks so much, man!
@RajKishorShaw17 Make sure your profile tells people exactly who you are, and why they should follow you.  Share a tip each day, and engage with 3-5 important accounts in your industry each day as well.
@debcreates Thanks, Debonkar!
@heysteveyy  https://t.co/TwgI63yXsp
@madsbrodt Review your top 10 Tweets of all time and turn them into templates to deliver information in vessels that are proven to work,.
@mrbooktook1 By understanding that everything worth doing is a long-game play.
@BecomingaThera I'm not sure, but I don't think of myself (or others) as "experts" per se.  I think of myself (and them) as having knowledge that other people want who are behind me in their journey.   Just "being you" may never really attract a following
@brandymedia Try niching down in the beginning and getting gradually wider over time.
@TheMBA_coach Try a tool like SparkToro or Followerwonk
@CarveQueen Thanks, Jen! 2x to 3x per day usually.
@SPAT_77 Build something that truly helps your audience figure out a problem they cannot solve and price it affordably.
@ADHDJobs 😍
@andrewconstabl9  https://t.co/IJVfpewYMz
@adarsh____gupta Appreciate you, Adarsh.
@ironicalwords I actually don't know, to be honest. I've never reviewed the ratio nor have I ever run a Twitter spaces :) Sorry.
@MakadiaHarsh Thanks, Harsh!
@JonahPerlin I welcome disagreement. There's a lot of advice that is contextual and doesn't have a right/wrong answer.  I block trolls and nitpickers.
@BrandonArvay I had a big following on LinkedIn. I think that helped, but I was stuck at 8k followers forever on Twitter even with that big following.  When I started creating constantly, I got noticed by bigger Twitter creators and that certainly helped.
@heyteo_ 1) LinkedIn has been good to me. I enjoy Twitter more.  2) Text only  3) No hacks. Just good writing and consistency.
@joe_goodman_ I wait until a particular business is stable (i.e. can be run on automation or with a VA) then I move to something else.
@shuuabe  https://t.co/XLblXS8NSC  3rd question in FAQ section.
@vendettasdf I write every day. I review my writing every day. I read great content from great writers every day. I constantly read about copywriting best practices.
@luke_netti 100%. It's probably easier.
@aaditsh I appreciate you, Aadit!
@m_ashcroft I carve time out each day to review my mentions and which replies drive more growth using tools like @blackmagic_so   Then, I participate for 30-45.
@ADHDJobs Love me some Dan Levy.
@MandaGummer It's a rather nebulous question, so probably not best for a Tweet. Try this:  https://t.co/05aHy1LUJL
@shuuabe I'm not sure, to be honest.  In the beginning, it was more about the quality of replies.  More recently, it's been about the quality of my actual Tweets.  I block time on my calendar to balance for sure.
@darentsmith Appreciate that, man.
@maxwellcdavis Maybe 45 minutes to an hour?
@hellocaffrey My own content. It used to be the opposite at the beginning.
@commswell_com Extremely important.  Everyone has something valuable to say. The 1% of people who study delivery and copywriting generally stand out.
@MandaGummer I dunno. Never led a funding round.
@EarthToDaniel Thanks, Daniel!
@rawimistry  https://t.co/IJVfpewYMz
@chrissha3 2x-3x per day. It's on a schedule, yes.
@Carlos_Scheuch Threads were the thing that started my growth trajectory moving much faster. I spent a lot of time researching the top thread creators on Twitter.
@ManjhunathRavi I tend not to let Twitter impact my mental health that much by curating a smart, supportive following. Anyone who starts impacting my mental health gets blocked immediately.
@darentsmith I dunno. I ask myself this all of the time.  Right now it's freedom and flexibility.  I think, ultimately, I'll go back to working with a small group of people I trust and admire to solve a problem.
@ADHDJobs They are getting people who have obviously cracked the code of attention to monetization. They likely bring a much different perspective than the average employee.
@DONVESH  https://t.co/XFQkSNZyCC

@HustleJoy Nope.
@AtulAGhorpade I'm not sure. I haven't built a SaaS with no-code.

@TheAmineAouragh I leveraged knowledge that I had acquired over the course of my life and then watched how other popular creators formatted their Teweets to make sure I delivered my information in a similar fashion.
@ManjhunathRavi Mostly commenting underneath large accounts with very high-quality responses.
@drernestomd Definitely.  It's much shorter and slightly more complex.
@copywithkush Helping people.  People tell me stories about quitting their jobs, building businesses, helping their families, etc.  It's pretty awesome.
@natolisnuggets I read your bio. You talk about how to "live a more fulfilling life", but that's a bit nebulous.   And, why should someone believe that you can help them? I'd focus more on nailing that down versus writing more Tweets.
@supermodi I don't have a team. It's just me. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question?
@MrDigitalAyush Happy to answer specific questions.
I've added 70k Twitter followers in 19 weeks.  AMA while I'm on a train for the next 2.5 hours.  I don't have all the answers but can try my best.

@thisisming @EmayEnvyi Immigrants make the most incredible entrepreneurs.
@ThusSpokeRahul Sure is, Rahul.
@prvsomani Encouragement from those who understand is so helpful.
@omarakhaddaj Exactly.
@CoreyKMedia Always happens that way.
@EvergreenMEP That’s such a common thing I hear, Greg.
@luke_netti Sad.
@anorsich That’s the right way to approach it, IMO.
@ArmaanWritess Yep. 20M+ laid off. Risky.
@ManjhunathRavi Great advice
Tell people you hate your job &amp; nobody bats an eye.  Tell people you're going out on your own &amp; get lectured on risk.
@capt_nandu @AliAbdaal @MeetKevon Thanks, Nandu!
@brendancahill_ @typeshare_co Congrats, man!
@tomwicky @heyeaslo Thanks, Tom!
@allisonbraley Secret: Jennifer is obsessed with haggis. I'm now on board.
@allisonbraley Not about you, my friend :) We loved seeing you!   London is great. In Edinburgh right now. A bit too touristy but nice architecture. London is our jam for sure.
@DgtlMike Oh, I believe it!
@allisonbraley I don't even know what subtweeting is, but if it's good, I'm doing it. If it's bad, I'm not doing it. 😂  Did you make it back with dog in tow?
@by__Ilia It almost always is.
@constructionge3 True story, Eric.
@CheetSheets So far. It's true.
@Creator_Coach There's no specific important question. Just a genuine curiosity to learn about other people.
@sladeerickson It's true.
@aaraalto I feel like curiosity springs when we're comfortable with our own life.  Talking and interrupting comes from the need to position ourselves as something we aren't in an attempt to impress.  It's not advice per se, but it's just an observation.
@indefiniteloops @Nicolascole77 I do. Every once in a while I take a call from an intro and I'm surprised when it goes the way it does.  This Tweet was more in reference to people I meet in everyday life. I'm just surprised by how much people talk and int
@Nicolascole77 Can I pick your brain (aka can I brain dump in an attempt to impress?)
I'm amazed by how many adults talk nonstop, interrupt constantly, and never ask questions.  Learn to listen and be curious.  Your life (and business) will drastically improve.
@DgtlMike Of course. You can’t understand their problems if you don’t listen to, and engage them. Table stakes.
@Jabuto_Jabuto Thanks man!
@Rafa_G_K Really enjoyed it, Raf! Thanks for having me on.
@yourpalomar No, you're right. I meant the latter, I was just rushing 🤦‍♂️
@Dmurr68 😂
@thenocodepro Make it easy, bridge a gap, win customers.
@yourpalomar The former is what so many people do. Confuse to impress themselves.
@RichaaVaid Always, Richa.
@henwalkco 100%. This is where metaphors come in handy, too.
@MakadiaHarsh Always, Harsh.
@TheophaneJean Use your customer's language for sure.
@sladeerickson Smart people simplify. Confused people complicate.
Tech people love jargon. Customers love clarity.  Impress those who matter most.
@ItsKieranDrew @dickiebush Great thread man!
@kylegawley Definitely. I just specialize in solopreneurship.
@ModestMitkus @AlexMaeseJ @OzolinsJanis @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @jessievbreugel Thank you man!
@BrianCarmody @heyeaslo @jacobm @mindvalley @dickiebush @heyblake Thanks, Brian!
@michael_kove @ZainabRose96 Sandler levels of awareness through discovery.
@EvergreenMEP Definitely. Add a transformation and you’ve got a good chance of closing the deal.
@writingtoriches If executed well!
@luke_netti I usually just make a simple recommendation. That often works well.
@austinbelcak Yep. Constantly chatting up your customer base unlocks so much more information.
@dovhyi 100% it does
@Shaynmtl One of the best sales formulas out there.
@Brett_Trainor Absolutely. Can’t always build a product or service around non-painful problems.
@serenaded_ Never easy. But incredibly effective.
6 steps to more customers:  - Understand your customer's biggest problem - Translate the problem to business impact - Tell stories about solving that problem - Share the transformations - Craft an irresistible offer - Show them how to buy
@RobCeceNJ That’s awesome, man. So happy to hear that! Keep it going.
@katairobi @austin_rief @amandanat @wes_kao @nathanbarry @mdeziel @jimmy_daly Thanks, Robert!
@gouthamjay8 @CSMikeCardona @HeyItsSophiaO @hypefury @webflow @typeshare_co Appreciate you, Mike!
@shock_lab Thanks so much, Mike!
@jessievbreugel I'd focus on a mix of being discovered through short-form social media content and showing your expertise through longer-form content like a newsletter or podcast.

@BrianCarmody That’s my story
Solopreneurship 101:  - Learn a skill at work - Consult with that skill for a reasonable rate - Learn about your customer's most pressing needs - Niche down to solving only that and raise your rates - Productize everything else you learned and sell it online
@SachinRamje @AlexAndBooks_ @SahilBloom @blakeaburge Thank you man!
@arnimpr Yep. My goal is to avoid things I hate.
@deanbdwyer Mostly my time. I spend 90 minutes per day walking with my wife at the park. We go out to lunch all of the time. It's wonderful.
@artinkaz Definitely. I feel that, Artin.
Solopreneurs goals should start with lifestyle, not money.  Filthy rich and burned out sucks.   Moderately wealthy and free is heaven.
@Nicolascole77 Love that. You would have thought I'd put it into a system, but I don't need to since y'all have!
@TMitrosilis Appreciate you, Teddy!
@sladeerickson @jmventurelog Thanks, man!
@JosephMaule Brevity mostly.
@ThePupOfWallSt 100%. That's where the viral stuff usually ends up...
@ChuckZeroToOne @GrammarHippy @List_Multiplier @wizofecom @searchbound Thanks, Chuck!
@moimaere Dope.
@roxana_social @dickiebush @VeryGoodCopy @aaditsh @arvidkahl @GuillaumeMbh @heyblake Thanks, Roxana!
@the_remote_club Looks like I hit a few. That's the ticket right there.
@PRINCELY_ARTs Nice!
@drernestomd I teach, challenge, and empathize. I'm not a super entertaining writer so I don't try.
@davharts Experiment!
@hellokellybrito You rock, Kelly. Thank you so much for the mention.
@hellokellybrito Sweet! Where can I read it?
@EarthToDaniel Very often. But in this case, they tend to underthink things.
@hellokellybrito Very few people actually teach for free. I try to do this daily.
@dennis_geelen Nailed it, Dennis.
@IndyDevDan 100%. Great content has these outcomes.
@ManjhunathRavi Yep. I bucket that under "makes me think".
@EvergreenMEP Definitely. The intersection of 2-3 is powerful.
@realAlexChapple Haha. True.
@LoftedLearning Definitely.
@serenaded_ Makes me think.
@sarvamwriter Education.
@mrbooktook1 Could easily fall under "makes me think".
@Diego23862434 You should aim for one in every piece of content.
@separmeen Sure, but content doesn't really save money or time, unless it educates.
4 types of content builds a following:  1. This person teaches me 2. This person entertains me 3. This person makes me think 4. This person understands me  That's about it.
@tibo_maker Yeah, I think so. It wasn't even from my content 😂
@sptroy Yes, another Twitter user mentioned me in a thread. Had nothing to do with my posts, just luck from producing so much content.
@rubenkenes @dvassallo @arvidkahl I think we all got mentioned in the same Twitter thread. Just luck 😀
@Dudehere @heyeaslo Appreciate it man!
@rorykc Thanks, Rory!
@MakadiaHarsh @heyeaslo It sure was!
@ioanabirleanu Thank you 😊
@sarvamwriter Thanks for spending some of your time reading my content, Sarvam.
@ShaunEls Just got mentioned by a big account and woke up to all of the new followers. Wild.
@ArmaanWritess I try :) I don't get to all of them.
@nathanaprice @ManjhunathRavi @heyeaslo 100%. Rising tides lift all ships.
@heychazza I don't think I qualify yet based on my account size.
@Reza_Kabiri_ Appreciate it. I didn't do anything except get mentioned in someone else's Twitter thread 😂
@eitan_levy101 Appreciate it, Eitan.
@ArmaanWritess Someone mentioned me in a Twitter thread that went pretty viral.
@joshuagowolabi Thanks, Joshua!
@CSMikeCardona Monitor.
@guslevitate I don't normally gain this many. Was mentioned in a Twitter thread.
@Ayaaaansk Awesome, Ayaan.
@ArmaanWritess It was thanks to someone else
@ManjhunathRavi I got mentioned in a Twitter thread by @heyeaslo   That dudes got the Midas touch :)
@heychazza Nah. No verification for me.
@Steven__Writes Thanks, Steven!
@desirejamilla I'm pumped
@Rarelyonmakeup Thank you so much!
I just gained 7,000 followers in 24 hours.  Thanks for hitting that button!  I talk about:  - Solopreneurship - Building diversified income - Creating systems to grow your business  Looking forward to helping you build a more intentional life through a one-person business.
@Dmurr68 Appreciate you featuring me! 🚀
@Bunbeau1 Thank you!!
Happy 8th Anniversary to this caring, intelligent, supportive stunner.  https://t.co/Dg9vI2GfyE
@JamesonCamp Thank you, sir.
@heyeaslo Awesome list. Thank you 🔥
@heyeaslo @TrungTPhan @chrishlad @david_perell @dvassallo @nathanbaugh27 Thanks for the shout, my man. Much appreciated. 🙌

@RileyTrembath It's simple, but the consistency is difficult.
@mikestottwp People asking to learn more, hear more, get more details, tell you how valuable something is, etc.
@pvukovic @TwemexApp One of my favorite plugins on Twitter.
@luke_netti The steps are simple. The execution is difficult.
@J_wilkinson Yes, definitel.
@nick_sutedjo The right people + the right idea + the right mission + the right balance. Even then, it's a 100:1 long shot.
@LearnBigIdeas Definitely. Compounding works almost everywhere...
@thealibilawal It definitely will. Great point, Ali.
@dennis_geelen 100% they do. Too many people pound away without ever stopping to analyze or listen.
@e_stradella This is awesome. I love it
@kengohth This is mostly just Twitter
@OlegLustenko It's all simple. Most people just don't stick with it.
@heyeaslo Great tips man. Love it.
@aaditsh Absolutely. Approach it like you're helping one person each day
@o0Aditi0o What's resonating
@feelthebyrn1 Love this
@adityatheverma Yep. Start simple and don't give up.
@ZachEHackett Yep. Many people just crank content and never analyze.
@EvergreenMEP Now I have a much more sophisticated content calendar, ecosystem of partners, long form newsletter, etc. But at it's core it's not too different.
@LuxurySkills @WizardsofIncome I didn't forget it. It's just table stakes.
@TMitrosilis Love these, Teddy.
@TheMBA_coach Just finding relevant content and getting involved in the conversation.
@sunilc_ Good tips.
@CobirulHoque @AuthorOnTheSide Threads worked early for me. I think most people just take some time to understand how to write good ones.
Someone asked me a great question:  What would I do if I were building online from scratch?  My answer:  • Share a simple tip each morning • Engage in 3 to 5 quality conversations per day • Share deeper insights 1x per week via a Twitter thread  And then listen for signals.
@ChrisClickUp @blackmagic_so
@drernestomd @blackmagic_so Yep!
@iLucaMicheli This is a weekly recap from @blackmagic_so
@touseefcodes And you meet excellent people.
@MMcCreesh It's worth it for the people alone.
@_KavinPrasath Yep. Exactly.
@SullyBusiness Yep. I'm not looking for RTs. I'm just looking to build relationships. Growth is simply an outcome.
Twitter observation:   Replies are a great way to grow.  (And meet extremely talented &amp; cool people)  https://t.co/9L7mgTs6vc
@thenocodepro @heyeaslo @dvassallo @dickiebush @EvansNifty @arvidkahl @AliAbdaal @makerpad Thank you, Sahil!
@thiagoghisi @LBacaj @AuthorOnTheSide Thanks so much, Thiago 🙌
@nookrecruiter Thanks so much, Michael!
@AuthorOnTheSide Thanks for having me man!
How to sell more:  Pay attention to how you buy.
@_IlirAliu @AngeZanetti @revue @getrevue @Kajabi I use Revue to have a newsletter banner on Twitter but pipe them through to Kajabi using Zapier.
@PeakTobi @CoreyWilksPsyD @Nicolascole77 Thank you, Tobi!
@MeshRHM I'm so glad to hear that, Mesh.
@Kellen_the_man Thank you, Kellen!
@hellokellybrito @KeithKeller @HeyJennyLee @rosemary_egbo @CelesteMohan @writes_eve @lukematthws @Podcasts4Profit @tomkuegler7 I don't have time for more live calls, so I prefer courses where I can learn at my own pace.
@iamsimm0 @ItsKieranDrew @thedankoe Appreciate you, man. Thank you.
@guerrist @dvassallo @elonmusk Please don't! :)
@gunnerkid Really good advice.
@TMitrosilis Yep. One of my go-tos.
@jakobgreenfeld I love that advice. Going to give it a try on my own.
@NiharikaSodhi Definitely, Niharikaa.
@hey_dhruv I love that Dhruv.
@thejonasme Yep. Ship and learn.
@PRINCELY_ARTs Write and edit at 2 different times.
@NiallRatcliffe I love that addition, Niall.
@Dmdrapp You're welcome. Thanks for reading it, Derek.
@fab_rosato Definitely, Fabio. Ship it.
@CobirulHoque Cut 30% of the words.
If you're struggling to produce written content:  - Start writing your piece - Take a break for 30 - Come back - Cut 30% - Publish  Process, not perfection.
@dvassallo @elonmusk I have been impersonated 51 times in 5 months.   A few of my followers have been scammed (bitcoin, of course) and it's to the point where I think it's highly brand damaging.  Someone will eventually start a class-action lawsuit.
@brendancahill_ @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush @typeshare_co YES! Love seeing it. Congrats man.
@sarvamwriter Thank you, Sarvam!
@TMitrosilis Definitely. Stay the course, watch it compound.
@theakarshit Exactly.
@hustlenconquer That's absolutely amazing. I wouldn't have guessed that.
@gentoftech 100%, Michael. Only downside is if we say something stupid :)
@Nicolascole77 💯 upside
@josuevallesp Nailed it.
@ManjhunathRavi Certainly!
@AdsMenace It definitely does, especially once it compounds.
@gobienan That's how I think about it.
@hey_dhruv 100%. Unless you say something terrible.
@Pracheetah Limited Partner.
@Creator_Coach It's why I don't take brain picks.
@ManjhunathRavi @Nicolascole77 100%. It's how I get written stuff done.
@michael_kove 100%
@J_wilkinson True. I won't do back-to-back though. Too difficult.
Because I write online each day, I've:  - Become an LP - Landed clients - Met new friends - Built 4 digital products - Done hundreds of podcasts - Built a private community of 600+  I have no idea what each piece of content will do.  But it's basically 100% upside.  Publish.
@OscarLagrosen Yes, I agree with this. I do this as well.
@Itsjarredbell @thepatwalls created one of the greatest sites in the world, IMO.   https://t.co/nfndtZqC6N
@MySuccessTheory SO much.
@brendancahill_ It's my favorite way to keep myself from being distracted.  P.S. My VA should have reached out to you. Cheers.
@hackernewbie Same. Or try my hardest to have zero meetings.
@AlizaKr Ha, that's so great. Thanks for sharing!
@gaviningham This is basically how I live.
@HarrisFanaroff - Brain picks - Podcasts - Presentations
@luke_netti Same.
@ItsKieranDrew Much more. It's why I mute everything and funnel all outreach to a VA.
@bradleywriting Emails and Slack notifs are the worst at breaking concentration. I turn everything off during work mode.
@feelthebyrn1 Yep. I funnel everything to a VA now, and review a document with a summary of outreach each evening.
@ManjhunathRavi I find even pausing to take notes takes me out of my flow.  I just shut down everything and focus. I assume, if it's important, I'll remember.
@drernestomd 100% Dr. E
@jjxe_ It definitely does. Therefore I try to timebox everything important.
Time management 101:  Keep context switching to a minimum.  30-minute meetings end up costing you 1 hour in lost productivity.  The deeper you get into your business, the more important it is to be wise with your time.  Write out templates for saying no to anything.
@melissa_scatena @jayclouse @wes_kao @dunkhippo33 @SahilBloom @stephsmithio Thank you!
@joshdviner Thank you man!
@constructionge3 @JamesonCamp I just priced it at what I would feel comfortable paying for it. That's always been my strategy.
@gus_tiffer 1. How to get attention 2. How to hone in on signal 3. What does my audience want? 4. How can I deliver that? 5. How can I scale that?
@BrianCarmody This is awesome. I love it!
@zachweismann I find helping, supporting, being compassionate, etc. to be things I love.   Doing them can be hard work, but not something I "don't like". I find that to be rather exciting and meaningful work. I love that kind of work.
@andreszannelli Ha, thanks. It's in my board deck.
@IndyDevDan Thanks, man :)
@Imene_Maharzi I like this GIF.
@landforce It really is.
@stevenshills20 I think so too, Steve.
@NinaGreimel Ha. Thanks, Nina.
@ItsKieranDrew This is awesome, Kieran.
@TMitrosilis Nada.
@SahilBloom I think so too. Not there yet, but trying.
@MentalWeapons Yep. Like most stuff worth doing, it's never easy.
@aurasky_ Tryin!
@TMitrosilis Thanks, Teddy!
@writes_eve I think certain people figure it out faster, and sure some folks might be more naturally inclined.   Do you have a large following?
@noahedelman2 Figure out their biggest pain points, and build something that solves them. Then ask.
@Tom_SkinnerBC Kajabi
@jessievbreugel Great collection here, Jessie!
My business plan is to avoid things I don't like.
@constructionge3 @JamesonCamp Q1: Zero. I don't run ads ever.  Q2: Just one. All of my courses are one-take, no editing, and one version.  Q3: I love Gumroad, but eventually I wanted to host everything in one place, website included.
@nonstack Make a lot of noise and look for signal.
@nonstack Make a lot of noise and look for signal.
@LockedinPerform My inclination is the latter.  Test out what it feels like to sell something, build something, deliver something, etc.  Don't go all-in until you actually know you enjoy the process and people want to buy what you're selling.
@nonstack This article will tell you how I did it:  https://t.co/F98NuBhT9r
@hellokellybrito @coach_avinash @NiharikaSodhi Maybe "impulse" isn't the right word.  What I meant was that if people are on the fence, they are more likely to buy something that's $150 vs. some $797 "masterclass". Those price points require incredibly de
@hey_dhruv I started in late 2018 because I knew I was leaving my full-time job.  So, I started writing as much as I could to figure out what resonated with people. Once I understood that, I doubled down on what worked and stopped what didn't.   I built t
@SachinRamje I'm not sure there's a right order, but at some point you should deepen the relationship with your audience via community.  I gave everyone in A&amp;I early access at a greatly reduced price.
@Creator_Coach It's my full-time job :)
@landforce Mostly because of my goals of working less vs. making more. I already make enough money to be satisfied.  Cohorts take a lot of my personal time and I want to do less of that.  The best answer on pricing here:  https://t.co/nB2K89t4En
@milenaregos I shared something on a video podcast and people went wild. I was like..."Oh. I should build this into a course"  And the course was born...
@LearnInAwe Q1: Presell the idea. Don't build it unless people buy it.  Q2: Timebox it to 14 days, keep it simple and affordable. Only after you presell and get some validation.  Q3: Everyone has impostor syndrome. Create for the folks a few years behind 
@copywithkush I definitely don't. Plenty to learn!
@AlexLlullTW I don't know, to be honest.  I think if you want to make something really long and detailed, you'll need a high price point to get high completion rates.  For me, I like to help people do one thing really well, in a short period of time, for 
@IamAndrewEllis Yes.
@HxstleCrew  https://t.co/05aHy1LUJL
@TBWPpodcast I don't think it's important. I think webinars are kind of 2018ish.
@AuthorVenkatesh I'm not sure, but I would go with whatever makes it easiest for you to get started. Worry about tools and tech once you've proven you can stay consistent.
@indiejuan Neither really.  Happiness isn't tied to those things. Those are just fleeting moments of dopamine.  Happiness is receiving messages via LinkedIn and Twitter when people start using what I write to build a better life. I get those daily.
@michaelkirsten That was the day I announced it.
@austinbelcak Added a new channel (Twitter) and used a recent event (S30for30 podcast) to drum up a ton of interest.
@theandreboso My hypothesis is that at $50 I would have more customers, similar revenue, higher refund/problem accounts.  My hypothesis is that at $250 I would have far fewer customers, similar revenue, lower refund/problem accounts.  $150 gives me a ton 
@thejimhart  https://t.co/zSnmbhgkNY
@dcgunner I never really "sell".  I talk about problems I hear people having and I present a solution and then ask people to buy it.  Not too salesy :)
@malikrajat_ No, I did not. I've never wanted someone ghostwriting my social media content.  I considered having someone write blogs many years ago for my SaaS advising business, but never followed through.
@dooneroisin - LinkedIn - The shorter, the better completion rates (obvious in hindsight) - No, I didn't waste much time this time around. I have before trying to find the perfect tech instead of just using what I know.
@brennan_decker Thanks for the mention, Brennan!
@TheophaneJean I did not. I expected to do that in a month, not 2 weeks.
@tomberryCD Thanks, Tom. Plenty of people doing it way better than me. Just figuring it all out.
@MikeRuffing4 @ImraneSubstack That's your job to make them aware through awareness marketing.
@sweatystartup Truest thing I've read on the internet today.
@tutors_primary Selling is just helping people solve their problems.  You need to understand your customer and their biggest desires and problems that keep them from reaching those desires.  That's your product.  Once you have it, you need to learn how to
@growthcurrency @heyblake @PavedEmail @TheTiltNews Thanks for the mention, man!
@YanisRenaud I'd build an audience first around a very specific topic. I'm not sure a milestone is needed, but I'd look for overwhelming signals that people want more knowledge from you.
@jkruman I like the intersection of what you enjoy, what you know a lot about, what people want to know more about, and what people will pay you for.  I wrote an article that might be helpful:   https://t.co/TwgI63yXsp
@_lincourt8 Ever deviate from the one umbrella topic I talk about.
@Alex_Swenson14 I am. It's not perfect, but so far I'm loving it.
@gyaan_central Build an audience around one very specific topic. Basically, become known for something.  Then, build a small coaching business. Learn as much as you can and productize what you learn.
@ThisIsAnmolJain Not building a big enough audience around one very specific topic. If you don't do that, nothing else matters.
@NicheDown Thanks, Michael!
@thenocodepro Response from the Ship 30 for 30 podcast with Dickie and Nicolas. People reached out en masse to ask about it, so I built it.
@_ZionSpirit_ I'm not sure if there's a "best" place, but try to play where you enjoy creating.  I like to write, so I use Twitter and LinkedIn. If you like video, try YouTube. If you like to record, try a podcast.
@AuthorOnTheSide I could probably figure it out, but I don't have it at the moment. Will dig in though.
@drernestomd My first launch did about $75k in 18 months. I think I made like $5k during the launch month.
@DivyanshLalwan5 No. Start simple and use a platform that exists.  Prove your idea out over the long term and then build your own thing.
@ImraneSubstack Talk to them and ask them about their problems. Once you hear the same problem many, many times over, the next thing you need to do is validate that they would be willing to spend money to solve it.
@_ZionSpirit_ Definitely. That's what I've been working on building for 3+ years.
@Steve_P_Brady I'm hoping there's a lot of good questions.
@StevenTrister Thanks, Steven!
@DivyanshLalwan5 2.9% to Stripe and the platform is $199/month.
@_ZionSpirit_ - Had all the features I wanted - Yes, I showed my system on a live podcast and people loved it so I built a course around it. - $150. I price it where I would feel comfortable buying it and where I think people will pull the trigger easily.
@ManjhunathRavi Starts with a launch spike and then decreases gradually over time until it normalizes.  I refresh a few times per year.  I have zero marketing spend. All organic.
@himanshugoel_me Become known for one very specific thing. Why should someone pay attention to you and ultimately purchase something from you?  Hone in on that and never stop.
@ItsKieranDrew Thanks, Kieran!
@BigBadKale Becoming known for one very specific thing online.
@chinar_amrutkar Thanks, Chinar!
@hellokellybrito Thanks, Kelly!
@ayushtweetshere I just liked all of the built-in features it came with for running my newsletter, subscriptions, and building out my whole website.  No, I don't want to discount my courses down for those platforms.
@natolisnuggets I don't think there's a "follower count" number that unlocks releasing a product.  I think it's more about becoming known for one very specific thing, and then paying attention to how many people in your audience ask you for help.  Once yo
@VicPivots LinkedIn, Twitter, and my email list.   I chose them because that's where my audience is.   I wish I had a sexier answer.
I just crossed $125k  in 16 days on my new course launch.  Ask me anything.  I don't have all the answers, but I can give you my perspective.  👇🏻  https://t.co/enS56ReUxj
@jamie_dru Congrats, man. That's amazing!
@brendancahill_ @TweetsbyCoachP Kajabi
@brendancahill_ @TweetsbyCoachP Thank you so much, man.
@brendancahill_ @TweetsbyCoachP So cool, man. Glad to see you're getting some incredible traction. It's never an exact science, but a fun one to play with!
@CSMikeCardona @gjsequeira @notion @felix12777 @learnwithvidya @notion4creativs @JhumanJ @JanelSGM I use this guy:  https://t.co/hA79L6HyuS
@lukematthws It's not lazy. It's the opposite. It's recognizing the value of your time.  My time is extremely valuable. The faster I can learn something, the better.   I'd rather learn something from someone who knows how to do it over searching down a ra
@ArmaanWritess It's a great book.
@thestevenmellor @lukematthws Yes. You also pay for the aggregation.
@JavascriptDon $50-$150
@lukematthws I don't think anything can just be YouTubed. I think my LinkedIn OS has a lot of stuff nobody has put on YouTube.  Many courses definitely can.  People don't always pay for the info, often they pay for the aggregation though. Especially peopl
@drernestomd Yep. Or building up their audience.
@hellokellybrito I just mean make it easy for people to "pull the trigger". The more impulse buy pricing, the more likely people are to say yes and then it's on your deliver 100x value.   https://t.co/NLVBSbb715
@thisisming Heck yeah. Glad it was helpful!
@ThePupOfWallSt That's awesome. I love that, Danny.
@Creator_Coach Yep. Forgot the last step :)
@ItsKieranDrew Really good advice. I use @blackmagic_so and it tracks my streak so I never want to break it.
@aimanjawedd We generally overcomplicate things.
@words2wealth Definitely a good one.
@dennis_geelen Smart move, Dennis.
@aurasky_ Love it, Sathya. I feel like prompts just keep me extremely focused.
@yeahcopy You're welcome!
@fab_rosato Certainly. These are simple, but effective.
@hellokellybrito Thanks for reading them, Kelly.
@ManjhunathRavi Definitely, Manjhunath.
@imtreyshields There's usually something true inside of humor. Suss it out.
@_sampoyan 100% it can, Sam.
Writing every day is hard.  Here are 4 prompts to make it easier:  - What's 1 thing I learned today? - What's 1 interesting thought I had? - What's something someone taught me? - What did my partner and I have a laugh about?  Then?   Find 30 minutes to write about them.

@fab_rosato @arvidkahl The problem should be related to time or money.
@tejas3732 @arvidkahl That's a good line to follow.
@Dudehere @AliQOfficial @AliAbdaal Thanks, fellas!
@Tim_Denning @Seanjkernan @Ayotheauthor @Nicolascole77 @creation247 Thanks, man!
@hey_andreanara Thank you :)
@Tobieh87 Thank you, Tobi!
@mkhundmiri @kylepdotco Thank you, Mustafa. Means a lot man.
@Nicolascole77 Definitely. I'm not very good at this, so will likely outsource.
@hey_andreanara Awesome. Glad you enjoyed the course, Andrea! Thanks for being a customer, I appreciate it.
@kylepdotco Appreciate that, Kyle.
@_IlirAliu @SahilBloom @agazdecki @Harshmakadia @OneJKMolina Thanks, man!
@zainabrose96 Thanks, Rose.
@hey_andreanara Definitely. Those are table stakes.
@aimanjawedd Most of good marketing and selling is Psychology based.
@janahan888 Appreciate your time, Janahan.
@OscarLagrosen Yeah, these are great.
@Brett_Trainor Definitely. A soft skill that is a requirement.
@funnygangwal  https://t.co/2KU3JhKCXG
@espressocopy Yes, they are definitely different skills IMO.
@schemingbilly It's definitely one of them.
@ManjhunathRavi It's certainly important.
@drernestomd They can be super common. No need to disrupt.
@hellokellybrito Nice! Sounds like a good post.
@hey_dhruv Exactly. Create interest through your stories and then have a viable solution.
3 skills every solopreneur needs:  - Problem-solving - Telling stories - Copywriting  1. Solve a big problem. 2. Make it relatable through a story. 3. Talk about it daily to attract customers.
@codewithnico @DavidVanMtl I’m not treating it as inferior at all.   I’m just sharing how my own mindset and focus changed.   Being an employee can be awesome. I did it for  16 years.

@zachweismann @jackbutcher @SahilBloom @dickiebush Yep. It is hard. Most of the charitable work I do isn’t tied to online, it’s offline.   I’m looking at a sponsorship that might change this.
@lucaslunzmann @heyecs @waitbutwhy Thanks for the shout!
@AlinaOkun Thank you, Alina!
@zachweismann @jackbutcher @SahilBloom @dickiebush I did drive 21,000+ unique visitors to a site I created to help Ukraine in just 3 days.   https://t.co/kzmfIHnbfr  It was then adopted and passed around The Peace Corp. Not too shabby.  😀
@thenocodepro That's where I'm at now...
@hey_dhruv Definitely, Dhruv. Focus becomes easier on the things that matter.
@NinaGreimel 100%, Nina!
@getbetterwithnb I think so too, Nikhil.
@funnygangwal For me as well, Shubham.
@nerita_ll Nice, Nerita!
When I worked a 9 to 5, I cared about:  - Job title - Salary + OTE - Number of direct reports - What peers thought about me  As a solopreneur, I care about:  - Health - Network - Free time - Creativity - Time with my wife - Location independence  A wonderful mindset shift.
@NiharikaSodhi I love this, Niharikaa.
@PaulElijas Thanks, Paul!
@tejas3732 Exactly, Tejas.
@ArrigoLupori Thanks. I think it's just slowing down and being aware.

@heyjoeyjustice Ha, thanks, Joey.
@bot5amz It should be taped to people's monitors.
@Mike_Klemmer Seems like it. So many get it wrong.
@chidiebere_ama :)
@ManjhunathRavi Exactly.
@zurieljeffre Try to help as many people as you can. Answer questions, share what you have, etc. Eventually, you'll become well known. That's part of relationship building.
Social media engagement 101  https://t.co/V5hJrnWE8O
@DOBCapital I'm excited to send it.
@Creator_Coach We're all stuck in certain areas. Just sharing as I learn.
@dklineii I'm here to deliver it :)
@StevenTrister Thanks, Steven!
@josiahfitness @AlexHormozi @taylorawelch @LeilaHormozi @OneJKMolina Thanks, man!
@jamie_dru I like to take walks with my wife. That's my favorite.
@WrongsToWrite @rize_io Oh cool. I'll check it out!
@jkruman Really smart, Jeff.
@umut_sonmez I love hearing that, Umut!
@bruce_beaumont Great questions, Bruce.
@pattyroxaschua Great system. One of the originals. I found tweaking it slightly for me worked well.
@MyBuddyAndrew Yeah, I'll bet you're right.
@Tanoy27 Good additions. Thanks, Tanoy.
@heyjoeyjustice That's a great framework. I like it.
@MentalWeapons Awesome. Thanks, Max!
@salesystemsB2B Just repeating the daily motions. My nightmare.
@zachweismann Great questions.  I swap kids for wine though.
@MyBuddyAndrew Working well?
I’ve started doing a weekly audit of my time.  I ask myself:  - What gave me energy? - What took energy away? - What can I easily eliminate? - What tasks need to be automated? - Is there anything I can outsource?  How do you review your time spent?

@darentsmith Thank you, man!
@e_stradella The Minimalist Entrepreneur by @shl
@thealexbanks Yep. Find great people. Create great community.
@ShaunEls Literally 99% of the time. It's wild.
@Nicolascole77 Same. It comes across my feed naturally, and I help when there are problems in the world.  But I won't seek out information with the sole intention of getting myself riled up.
@Nicolascole77 Well said.
@ApexMindAdam @BenjaminPutano @tomberryCD Yes. I won't connect with any political talking heads.
@maffeodrinks It's the most positive change I've made.
@writer_xoemxo They are, but I'd rather not be bombarded.
@JacobSuckow Yep. My own small ecosystem.
@tomberryCD @BenjaminPutano Same here. I won't listen to anything intentionally divisive.
@wherrmann1 That's exactly it.
@ryansatkinson Nobody want to read you sh*t is a fave.
@roddaut You have to.
@eugenecheang I like "How I Built This" and "$100 MBA".
The daily news is miserable.  So I surround myself with:  - Great books - High performers - Uplifting podcasts - A motivated community - A positive Twitter audience  I'm going to brainwash myself before the world can.
@AtulAGhorpade @ayushtweetshere It's suspended already. It's happening daily. Twitter has a problem.
@nookrecruiter Appreciate the shout here, Michael.
@nookrecruiter Thank you my man.
@g3Mo @aurasky_ @starryeyedak Most courses never get finished, therefore the audience never gets the value. Make them easy to consume (short).
@dickiebush Great list, Dickie. Here's one:  If you can't teach yourself, you'll always be a liability.  All of these pieces of advice became easier to execute when you stop asking other people what to do and start learning on your own.
@7Printz @dickiebush @OneJKMolina @waronweakness @colinyjchung @JoshuaLisec @thedankoe @GrammarHippy @The_MMW @creation247 @writingtoriches @WrongsToWrite Thanks, Kevin 🔥
@luke_netti Simple solutions win.
@ArrigoLupori Great! It's helpful not to spend 50 hours on something only to find out people don't want it. Ya know?
@radhikaparekh_ Correct. It must solve one pain point.
@ArrigoLupori For your first one, just keep it simple.  Presell it before you build anything. If people buy it, build it.   If they don't, don't.
@bhawanaasharma Yeah. I generally keep mine below $200.
@ShaunEls I like to start with a service, learn everything I can about how to best deliver the intended outcome and then productize it.
If you are building an online course, stop.  You must have these 3 things:  - A problem your audience says is painful - A specific outcome in mind for the student - An outline to solve that in 60 minutes or less  Alleviated pain + high completion rates = happy students
@brandondigital Appreciate you, man!
@LynnRivest Glad you like the simplicity. Thanks for the shout.

@drernestomd @melissa_scatena Share that stuff, Melissa!
@constructionge3 Try interesting things.
@bradleywriting That can definitely be frustrating.
@OscarLagrosen Very cool, Oscar!
@AngeZanetti Yes. Exactly!
@RitwikSrivast11 Good luck!
@The_MoBiz Certainly.
@SikiraAmer Definitely. But having them offline is a good start.
@JasonHershman That's exactly it, Jason.
@Tobieh87 Yep. That's a good way to measure it.

@arulvelan85 Damn, I love that.
@fab_rosato Definitely. It's why I make courses short and affordable with the intention of surprising and delighting with 100x return.
@copyforcreators It's something we all come to realize over time.
@ChristineCarril I wish too, Christine.
@ArrigoLupori Thank you so much, Arrigo.
@CoreyWilksPsyD Absolutely. Read your own content and ask "would I be happy I spent time reading that?"
@Nicolascole77 Even when money isn't spent, there is a transaction. That's sales.
@DevLinguistic Absolutely. Put 100% effort into these things.
@podfixer101 That's my goal!
When you write, create a transaction.  https://t.co/9WBmdoe3ro

@dickiebush This👆🏻 Exactly this.
@imThomasMorales @tferriss Ooh. I love that.
@melissa_scatena I feel very similar, Melissa.
@dennis_geelen Awesome, Dennis!
@drernestomd Yep. Or if you have a 9 to 5, use it to fund your future one-person business.
@ItsKieranDrew True story, Kieran.
@hiyabodhi I look at it differently. I think considering your options and potential for failure is smart. Just have a plan.
@Dhruvpipebagger Definitely. You can build toward this slowly while you have a job.
@BuzzRobTaylor Agreed, Rob.
@tomgarcy Exactly. Great stuff, Tom.
@ArmaanWritess That's how I think, Armaan.
@theorencohen Don't stop working. Pay your debt. Tinker with a side project in your free time.
@Creator_Coach Definitely. Find a supportive network and you're much more likely to succeed.
@BlackLabelAdvsr That's what I like :)
@hey_dhruv Always some slight risk, but riskier never to try.
@AuthorOnTheSide Thanks so much for having me on, Hassan.
More people should try solopreneurship.  It's not as risky as you think.  - Likely worst case is you go back to work. - Likely best case is you unlock a better life.  Feels riskier never to try.
@ChrisWalker171 @dereknielson @ShaanVP @carrd I don't feel like it's intentionally contrarian.   I just feel like you have a better understanding of modern marketing, and therefore that puts you at odds with antiquated techniques that are parrotted by mos
@andyjackcandle 😂
@josuevallesp @pradologue Thank you!
@janahan888 @ShaanVP L1: why is that a problem? L2: what have you tried? How did it work? L3: how does fixing this help you financially? L4: Same as L3 but personally.   These are rigid examples. Have to make it a bit softer.
@dickiebush Haha. Thanks man. No more excuses. Let’s go.
@ShaunEls @EggrolI @dickiebush Well hell. Thanks man!
@blakeaburge Appreciate it, Blake!
@khemaridh @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Nice. This looks like an episode to tune into…
@kadavy @DanNelken Awesome! I prefer to listen so I’ll take a look.   Dan, I was pleased to see your book was shorter than most and easy to read (plus extremely good info). My kinda book! 🙌🏻
@jmcmillen89 Landing page copy is such a beast.  Whenever I build a new page, I just stare at it angrily. So much work.

@kadavy Yeah, that's a pretty darn good approach.  I enjoy talking to people who have built businesses and just building on my own and making a bunch of mistakes.   Usually 20% the former, 80% the latter. But, again. That's just me.
@kadavy The average business book is crammed with filler content, and people love business books.  Most chapters are around 5-10 pages of strategic or tactical info followed by numerous example stories.  I don't need examples. I assume it works if the per
@kadavy Definitely not the only one.  I think different mediums exist to help different learning styles.  For example, I'd rather learn a business concept in a video course for 45-minutes than try and get through a 300-page book filled with 250 pages of f
@russleads @dickiebush I don't agree with this entirely.  I think cohorts are great for some people.  I think courses are great for some people.  Personality-dependent.

The biggest mistake I made as a solopreneur?  Not having a Creator Funnel.  Back in 2019, I had zero plan.  Now, I:  - Get discovered (social) - Deepen trust (newsletter) - Build relationships (community) - Monetize (products and services)  Creator Funnel = predictable revenue

@Nicolascole77 I love the idea of being a category king. Such a great term and really paints a picture of how to act. I've written something similar before and referred to it as a "niche of one".  Good stuff today.
What's the best online course you've taken?
@dickiebush @patio11 This is maybe one of the greatest things I've read. Ha.  Thanks for sharing it, man.
@CoreyWilksPsyD Exactly. I think people think of promotion as always selling.  It's really about sharing your thoughts and ideas every day. That's just free promotion.
@stephenhannna Yep. Just writing to myself today.
@Nicolascole77 Ain't that the truth. Been meeting cool people left and right.
@Matt_Mastando Some downside but very minute in comparison to the upside.
@henwalkco I sure hope so, Henry.
@ishiid I appreciate it, Dai.
@thecodetutore Thanks, man!
@ArmaanHaha Thanks, Armaan.
Promote yourself online every single day.  - Your work - Your brand - Your opinions - How you think  People will either:  - Love you (customers) - Hate you (who cares) - Join you (network) - Follow you (students) - Ignore you (already are)
@GuillaumeMbh Well, shit man. Thank you! I'm honored.
@McLovin_Murat @harrydry Love StoryBrand.
@LoftedLearning @harrydry Definitely!
@joelshansen @harrydry He sure does, Joel.
@darentsmith @harrydry @Austen That sounds like a book I should pick up. Thanks, Daren.
@ModestMitkus @harrydry Excellent additional advice.
@MattRubinstein1 @harrydry Certainly. Thanks, Matt!
@hey_dhruv @harrydry This simple outline has worked wonders for me.
When building landing pages, @harrydry says:  1. Explain the value you provide (title) 2. Explain how you'll create it (subtitle) 3. Let the user visualize it (visual) 4. Make it believable (social proof) 5. Make the next step easy (CTA)  Still the best guidance I've found.  https://t.co/uHMKIYP54D

Copywriting lesson:  Pain: generate pain with writing Agitate: turn the knife until it's worse Intrigue: present an intriguing alternative Positive future: paint a picture of a better future Solution: provide a solution that brings people there
@damienpahulu Thanks, Damien! 🙌
@chrisbits92 Nice!
@ArmaanHaha This is almost always true.
@aryan_kochhar I looked for areas where I continuously fell back to doing things in a manual fashion and continued to figure out ways to chip away at that with automation.
@vegardwikeby Oh definitely. Systems for everything.
@Powercommitment Consistency is often the outcome of having great systems. I think failure comes from relying only on willpower alone.
@ModestMitkus One of my faves.
@mikhail_kochkin Certainly, it can. Especially if it works every time.
@darentsmith Nice!
@Denis__Shatalin Agreed 100% here.
@podfixer101 When creativity fails, systems are there.
@hey_dhruv Absolutely. Systems are in place to keep from failing.
@_IlirAliu @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi I used Gumroad forever. I loved it. Kajabi allowed me to bring my whole business together under one roof.

@Steve_P_Brady Give it a whirl. It takes a lot of practice over time.
@famndingers What an awesome compliment. Thanks so much for it, Mike.
@tonyhackettaus Thanks so much, Tony.
@dickiebush @craigclemens Great thread, man.  I need to dive way deeper into Craig's stuff. Will be doing that this weekend. Appreciate the share here.

@dickiebush Appreciate you, Dickie. Cheers and have a great weekend man 🍻
@Tobieh87 I’m not sure. Just started testing. Will let you know though!
@muskmarketeer Love me some Bill Burr.
@SachinRamje @wes_kao @SahilBloom @naval @morganhousel @KateBour @Nicolascole77 @joedubeytldr @dickiebush @blakeaburge Dope! Love 'em, man.
@autotrader87 😂
@Jousefm2 So many of those stories too...
@heychazza I know I used to.
@ArmaanHaha That's exactly it, Armaan.
@podfixer101 Ha. Love that, David.
@_IlirAliu Thank you! I'm starting to reach a place where I need a VA though.
@NinaGreimel Definitely. I just meant it's not always related to business success, when maybe I should have said revenue.
@GPastural For sure.
@darentsmith Yep. Sometimes it's that they paid enough people to spread their stuff.
@hey_dhruv Exactly. That's the lesson right there, my man.
@AuthorOnTheSide Ha. For sure!
Some people have 100k Twitter followers and make $10k/year here.  Some people have 10k Twitter followers and make $100k/year here.  Followers aren't a proxy for business success.
@Robert_Galena Appreciate it, man. I just put the finishing touches on it, and I'm excited to send it out.
@cyberstripes Thanks, TJ!
@igorbenic @arvidkahl @AlexLlullTW @MeetKevon @victor_bigfield @natmiletic @NotechAna @tibo_maker Thank you for the mention 🙌🏻 Great folks on this list.
@Singhcredible Smart. I always do this.
@iarifahmad Lots of folks recommending this.  Going to give it a try and see how that works for me.
@ShaunEls I like it. It's so funny. Some people are saying "let it rip" and others are saying "let it marinate".  Per usual, no "right" way to do things.
@jthomas__ Haha. Good to know.
@_JTomlinson I like this one...I usually do both. Going to try my best to separate.
@Alec_Coughlin Smart.
@ayushtweetshere Yep. Smart.
@Matt_Mastando Yes. Love that, Matthew.
@jamie_dru Yep. That's step zero.
@jthomas__ Interesting. Do you ever just let it rip?
@hey_dhruv Damn. Good stuff, Dhruv.
@tedolson Ah, yeah. Good one, Ted.
How to be a great internet writer:  - Understand psychology - Consume good content - Practice writing daily - Understand format - Cut 30% of words - Ask for feedback - Experiment often - Get to the point - Review data - Iterate  What's your best writing tip?

@Dmurr68 @AdamRy_n @KateBour @andymewborn @arihappywick @social_savannah @ianrborthwick Thank you, my man :) Very appreciative.  You're right there on marketing. Give this man more attention!
Who is an up-and-coming creator you would invest $10k in?   (with zero hesitation)
@raine_street I track it using analytics tools like Shield for when I write on LinkedIn and  https://t.co/jL3msQbh7x for when I write on Twitter.
@mikhail_kochkin I've built systems to fall back on for when I'm not feeling super creative.
@realjefflarge It's kinda weird because my personal life is also sort of my professional life. But generally writing content, newsletters, etc.
@Zaid_BinAdam Started with SaaS sales and have pivoted as my life has changed.  I write mostly on LinkedIn, Twitter, and my newsletter.
@CBrandonDillon No. I'm new to writing on Twitter regularly. Started about 18-19 weeks ago.  I have nearly 200k followers on LinkedIn where I started writing 40 months ago.
@binno_james I'm not, but I've been a guest on their podcast.
@navdeepsoni I have a whole 4-part system.   https://t.co/zSnmbhgkNY
@stephenmostrom Yeah, being cognizant is a huge part of it.
@NinaGreimel Looking fwd to seeing 'em
@ashoukry Yes. I write every single day from 12:15p to 1:30p in my office. I rarely miss.
@eugenecheang It's gotten much easier over time, thankfully.
@melissa_scatena It's literally the thing that keeps me going.
@muskmarketeer Thank you!
@Steve_P_Brady True, but I don't write for "people".
@podfixer101 It's true with nearly anything, ya know?
@wadboy_ We all fail sometimes. Just write the next day!
@DividendIncome_ I love this.
I committed to writing daily 40 months ago.   Here are my results:  → 87.8% adherence → 1,750+ unique pieces → 250,000+ new followers  Not 100%, but what a wild journey.  I'm convinced habitual writing makes any entrepreneur better.
@thenocodepro Think about the long-term implications of being tied to something you might not like doing, and then find a way to test it out without commitment.
@pradologue @tibo_maker Appreciate that fellas!
@jonbrosio @richroll @Casey @guyraz @HowIBuiltThis @ramit @RyanHoliday @hubermanlab @RobertGreene @jaltucher @marieforleo @ThisIsSethsBlog @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @joerogan @naval @BreneBrown @JamesClear @mikeroweworks @JordanHarbinger Thanks for inclu
@JasonHershman Thank you for such a great thread. Cheers, Jason!
@JasonHershman Boom! Love to hear it man,.
@jessievbreugel  https://t.co/LF88jF7zUY
@liviumlabs Yeah. Usually it's just trolls and nitpickers. I'm Mutumbo with the block button over here.
@HelloKade Look at the data. What drives revenue? What drives attention? What do you work hard on that does almost nothing?   Do more of the former and less of the latter.
@DOBInvestments Sure. Take tons of small risks. Double down on what works, throw away what doesn't.
@stephenpratley I think so. I like building a portfolio of products because it can always grow.
@hexybrands  https://t.co/yA6J1Pmegw
@thestevenmellor Audience first is a 100% must.
@natolisnuggets For sure. Love that, Ant.
@SergioRocks That's awesome, Sergio. A great thing to educate founders on.
@stephenpratley For me, it means not getting wrapped into lengthy projects that don't have an exit.  Want to try something? Make sure you like it before committing to 12 months.  That's what I meant. Thanks, Stephen!
@adamkreek Thank you, Adam. The more popular you get, the more you attract people who want to bring you down.  I'm not an arguer. I'm just a guy who prunes noise.
@SvenSlattum @_hannahahn  https://t.co/InTODEA5V4
@itsbradleyjay Thanks, Bradley.
@StressUndone Important stuff.
@ArtSpaceOfGrace For sure.
@_hannahahn Sure. Don't wrap yourself into a year-long journey that you aren't sure about.  Give yourself outs.
@nerita_ll Definitely. Run away fast.
@hey_dhruv Definitely some important stuff, Dhruv.
Advice I wish I had 2 years ago:  • Focus on the 20% that matters • Generating attention is most important • Outsource/automate administrative tasks • Before building anything, consider optionality • Block and ignore anyone who doesn't deserve you  Hope that helps.
@FindTroy Thank you, my man. 🙌
@Imene_Maharzi Hell yeah. LFG
@dklineii Thank you my man!
@theorencohen Awesome. Don't give away all of the secret sauce ;-)
@matt_gray_ @CoreyWilksPsyD Hell yeah. Chat soon!
@CoreyWilksPsyD LFG.
@jamesklicked Appreciate that so much 🚀
@muskmarketeer Thank you!
@scribblykaur I like to think so. It's so nice to hear it from folks, though.
@kk_komal Thank you, Komal!
@Steve_P_Brady 100% Steve
@Growth_Corner The flywheel can be MASSIVE
@JasonHershman hello@justinwelsh.me   You'll get an auto-responder, but I'll receive it.
@dklineii Hell yeah. That's what I like to hear, Dave.
@dennis_geelen Thank you so much, man!
@podfixer101 Thanks, David. You definitely will, man. It's a game that requires a ton of work.
I have 4,755 online course students.   At least once per day, one of them says something good about my product.  That's a helluva marketing channel.
@Shusmo Thank you, my man!
@dickiebush I've seen people overcomplicate things for 5+ years, then simplify and actually see their first results. Start simple, you can always add complexity later.
@milenaregos Thank you, Milena. I'm so glad you liked it!
@YanisRenaud Haha. Nah.  Once you have interested people, you need to help people understand that there is a solution to their problem.  Once they believe that, the last step is sharing why YOUR solution is the best one.  A: Awareness I: Interest D: Decis
@YanisRenaud Basically, it's on you to highlight the problem in all of the content you create, and all of the marketing you produce.  Then you need to capture people interested in learning more and start to create interest in solving the problem.
@YanisRenaud Sounds like you need awareness marketing.  Awareness marketing is intended to make people aware of a problem they don't know exists.  You can't solve a problem that someone doesn't even know they have.
@funnelcopies Exactly. Noise and attention is key. Honing in on the signals becomes the differentiator though.
@legend_lumie You don't need a book. Go get started.
@juleslancee @WebinarOS  https://t.co/IJVfpewYMz
@CeoJeremiah Love it, Jeremiah.
@Garrath_R Correct. Hone in on what's working.
@castle_bridges Alrighty.
@hellokellybrito Sure. Look back at my Twitter account or read my LinkedIn profile.  I've written every morning on LinkedIn for 3 years and every day 2x (usually) on Twitter for almost 5 months.
@hey_dhruv Yep.
@juleslancee @WebinarOS Cool! Don't forget to create a lot of attention first.
@legend_lumie You need a system for producing results:  - journal - ask yourself what you learned - think about what you needed to know 2 years ago - Ask family and friends what you're good at
@rajasimon Write on the internet. All introverts can do this.
@drernestomd Because building products and services seems like "business" when what they really need is marketing.
@NinaGreimel 100%. Achievable and likely if you put in the consistent work.
@Brett_Trainor Focused = one building block at a time
@OfferMafia Then, hone in on what's working.
@ModestMitkus I see you :)
Solopreneurship has never been easier:  - Create lots of noise - Analyze to find signal - 2x what's working well - Create a service offering - Get it very systematized - Productize in a course - Raise service rate  None of this is possible without some noise.  Create some today.
@SikiraAmer @CJ_250marketing @SimonHoiberg @arvidkahl @chddaniel @mkhundmiri @theandreboso @tibo_maker @dagorenouf Thank you!
@flo_ridad Thank you, my man 🙌
@NickB2005 @CJ_250marketing I appreciate that, Nick 🙌

@shuggilippo I have 2020 license plates still. AMA.

@Nicolascole77 Thank you, my man. Best decision I ever made. 🙌
@commandodev @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi It's on Kajabi, but I'll work to get everything in one place.

@HarrisFanaroff  https://t.co/TX4J9hmQnt
@EvergreenMEP Just systems-based. That's all!
@josherau @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi @SaveToNotion Appreciate it!
@ShaunEls Many thanks, Shaun. 🙌
@mr_otg @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi Much appreciated!
@vvilltaylor Appreciate you, Will!
@KurtisHanni I'd do it the same. Low-cost products built on what I learned selling my coaching/advising service.
@BrandDifferentl Heck yeah. See you inside. Can't wait to hear your feedback.
@coach_avinash Thank you so much, Avinash.
@natolisnuggets Love hearing it man.
@copyandcheese Thank you, my man 🙌
@AliTheCFO I don't simply because I don't love to be on video.
@SPAT_77 I work a normal 9-5 like anyone. I just do it on my own terms.
@SergioRocks Nice, man. This is awesome.
@BrandDifferentl It is a course.   https://t.co/zSnmbhgkNY
@natolisnuggets Oh hell yeah. Thanks, man.
@chelyn_briand @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi Appreciate you, Chelyn :)
@dklineii Thank you, my man!
@BrandDifferentl I break it down inside of the Content OS
@hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
@hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi None of these systems matter if you can't get discovered.  So, I took my 4-part Twitter &amp; LinkedIn Content Operating System and turned it into a product.  I just released it this morning.   If you're interested
@hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi 9/ Coaching  Two weeks after completing my course, students receive an email positioning my coaching services.  Candidly, I don't want to do more coaching.  But it's where I discover the most ideas for new products
@hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi 8/ Affiliates  When you complete the course, I position my affiliate program.  It's all automated with video and email prompts, plus self-onboarding.  When new affiliates enter the program, they receive instant tem
@hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi 7/ Upsells  I position upsells at the front end of the purchase flow.  But I also send automated emails when lessons are completed.  They position relevant recurring revenue products.  Finish a section on templates
@hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi 6/ Testimonials  I use a short 55-second video to ask people for testimonials.  Rather than have them email me, I embed  https://t.co/DNeY0WF8u7 into the module.  When they click it, their camera opens up and they

@hypefury @typeshare_co 4/ Private community  Communities deepen relationships.  I run one with 600 solopreneurs from 55 countries.  I built a very complex application, acceptance, onboarding, and churn process using @outseta  You can read more about that
@hypefury 3/ Newsletter writing  Newsletters build trust in the Creator Funnel.  But, they are usually time-consuming.  To write mine in less than 30 minutes, I use @typeshare_co  Built by modern digital writers, it provides the templates I need to work q
2/ LinkedIn content  If you're creating for Twitter &amp; skipping LinkedIn, you're missing out.  My first 7-figures came entirely on that platform.  I use @Hypefury to cross-schedule everything from Twitter to LinkedIn.  Plus, I can make minor adjustments to be platform-relevant.
1/ Twitter content  Generating revenue as a creator starts with being discovered.  I have a 4-part Operating System for:  - Curation - Templatizing - Rapid creation - Distribution &amp; growth  This allows me to create 15-30 pieces an hour.
Today, I'll cross $2M in income in 2.5 years as a creator.  All 6 revenue streams are managed using systems.  Here are my 9 "must-have" systems for creators.  [🧵 thread}

@marcposchdesign Not if you want to be efficient.
@iammosesaboh Put shitty content into a template and nothing happens. It's more than templates.
@ryanLinner @mattheytens Zero ads. I've never run one.
@_nathanrene Alright.
@iamsimm0 Great thread. Appreciate the shout!
@Nicolascole77 Thanks. Should I coin it?
@muskmarketeer Thank you!
@dickiebush Exactly. Creating is my job. And like any good business, it requires systems.   Willpower eventually falters at some point.
@writetoon Love hearing this. Thanks so much!
@jessievbreugel @joserosado @dvassallo @arvidkahl @evielync @MeetKevon @AlexLlullTW @NiharikaSodhi Great stuff, Jessie!
@MakadiaHarsh Once you have them in place...woah. Scale.
@BarbaraFleury It truly is, Barbara.
@WillCoombe @JamesClear That quote is in my systems course :).
@tomberryCD Certainly part of systems, yes. (At least, my systems)
@TJCBerman I have a whole content creation system built out using 4-different pieces. Let's me create 20 pieces per day.
@melissa_scatena Same!
@MrJacobEspi Same. Once I understood them, it was game over.
@mr_otg Correct. And creativity.
@Steve_P_Brady Yep. Do the work. Learn. Systematize.
@VladPasca5 Same here, Vlad.
@natolisnuggets Yep. And keeps you producing on "down" days.

Content creation is 10% creativity, 20% work ethic, and 70% systems.
@mattheytens This is such a great thread, Matt. Thanks!  I knew the original thread I wrote had more value in it, and I was determined to have more people see it.
@aurasky_ @dvassallo He's the man that started all of this for me.
@dennis_geelen Nailed it, Dennis.
@girdley Oh, wow. I love this, Michael. Thanks for sharing it.
@AliTheCFO Certainly. It's best when a few work!
@tysjohnson Correct. Chain 'em all together.
@dklineii I love that, Dave.
@ashish4sharma Systems.
@TheKushagra25 I sure hope so.
@girdley Thanks, Michael! Is this how you operate currently?
@dikshayaar Correct. Too many people do.
@igorbenic Yep. You can always double down on the biggest.
@EvergreenMEP 100%. Don't go "all in". Build multiple opportunities.
Treat your career like a VC.  Build a portfolio of revenue streams, knowing one will hit big.  The diversified entrepreneur.
@BetterCeo I'm not changing the definition.   I'm advocating that we stop telling people what they can and cannot become.
@thejosephmurray Lol.
@dickiebush Exactly. Start something small. Chip away.   Build it up past your current role and then turn it into a full time gig.
@MrJacobEspi Oh same!
@Saasterix That's 100% true.
@zurieljeffre Thanks Zuriel
@DevLinguistic You're welcome!
@CoreyWilksPsyD Correct.
@KarlLHughes 100% it does, but I'm not sure entrepreneurship requires you to quit your job and stop getting paid. Plenty of entrepreneurs started with side hustles.  I agree not everyone will succeed, but who am I to keep people from trying?
@tomberryCD 100% agreed, Tom.
@hellokellybrito Entrepreneurship is a lot of things. I just hate when other people project their doubts onto others.  I've been told plenty of times it "isn't for you". If I had listened...damn.
"Not everyone is an entrepreneur" is silly.  We're all born to create and that's the spirit of entrepreneurship.  So go out there &amp; build your thing.  Don't let a bunch of babysitters project their lack of self-confidence onto you.
@brennan_decker Thank you so much for being a customer, Brennan. Glad you enjoyed it!
@lochhead @theclearhead @natolisnuggets Of course. Sorry if my original Tweet came off as aggressive. That wasn't my intention, I just wasn't paying much attention. Good back and forth!
@lochhead @theclearhead @natolisnuggets "Play Bigger" Looks awesome.
@theclearhead @lochhead @natolisnuggets I just bought this to see what all of the fuss is about.
@drernestomd I 100% agree with this, Ernesto. Great point here.
@theclearhead @lochhead @natolisnuggets Haha. I just read it. I love it too 😂
@dickiebush The easiest way to start writing well is to unlearn everything first.  Then start filling your brain with education from the new wave of digital writers.   Like you.
@ItsDaleBHarris This 👆🏻
@arvidkahl @kylegawley  https://t.co/4UV60hzX3Q
@chelyn_briand Too many people moving way too fast.
@dikshayaar Exactly. Build a service business first.  Learn exactly how to solve a common problem.   Turn that into a product.
@muskmarketeer Yep, but especially those relying on only themselves.
@WillCoombe One of my favorite quotes.
@andrewmcbarnett Sure - a different platform, different audience, different discord, etc.  It's a whole new game.
@jamie_dru I recently spoke to someone building a product.  I asked him to describe it. He did.  I asked him if his audience would use that language to describe their biggest problems. They would not.  Ouch.
@kylegawley @arvidkahl I feel like Arvid has cool sayings for everything 😂
@SahilBloom @sweatystartup Do interesting things and attract interesting people.
Advice every solopreneur should hear:  • Spend years giving free knowledge • Don't sell, just listen for problems • Learn to solve the problems • Build a service business • Then productize  Far too many people sell before they understand their audience.  Play the long game.
@OmarMKhateeb @lochhead I agree with Christopher here as well.  I should have been more clear on my original Tweet. Your journey must ultimately be about them.  I'm not advocating for a me-first approach, but rather a you-first approach through the journe
@lochhead Easy to say with confidence.  Prove it.
@AdamVazquez That sounds awesome. 🙌🏻
@TheFalanBlake 100%. It’s a club building together.
@TheQCGhost Probably pretty close to the truth in the solopreneur world.
The best marketing for solopreneurs is bringing people on your journey.   If you're doing interesting things offline and not sharing them online, you're losing customers.
@juancolamendy Thank you, Juan!
@BahWad Appreciate it, man. Thank you.
@separmeen No jackpot. Just writing and building every single day for over 3 years 😀
@separmeen Pacing about $1.3M

@Tim_Denning (Almost) bald! Nice thread, Tim.
@amandamoore1012 @HawkenSchool This is where I'm from in Ohio. Love Hawken.
@warikoo Yet everyone is here on Twitter trying to learn them in less than 280 characters.  Pretty wild, ya know? :)
@jessievbreugel Great question. I wrote a thread that I thought was killer information and very few people read it.  So I just rewrote the hook and it became this:   https://t.co/NxMdQiFKch
@jessievbreugel Basically, if it does well (subjective) I repurpose it 4-5 months later.
@jessievbreugel Exactly. I can't remember almost anything people wrote.
@ShaunEls Yep. Learn to say 1 thing 1,000 different ways and you'll be in good shape.
@AuthorOnTheSide Sometimes. Other times it doesn't need any editing, IMO.
@diegoquendoo This is exactly how I think about it, Diego.
@kimwillishere Or just repurpose in a similar format. People never remember.
@SergioRocks Exactly. Those data points are super key.
@DevLinguistic A little bit of both is what I do. Some content is best left untouched.
@MentalWeapons Exactly. Edit what worked until it's even more powerful.
@luke_netti I wait about 4-5 months.
@Art0fLife_ @victor_bigfield I usually do 4-5 but there's probably no "right" answer.
@dklineii Love that, Dave.
@TheMBA_coach It's amazing when you find out that they do. Or that they missed it in the first place.
@podfixer101 That it does. My best content is often a year old or more.
@instastrategist Learn to say 1 thing 1,000 different ways.
@SPAT_77 Definitely. Keep teaching others.
@JarvisKa Exactly. If it resonated, make sure more people see it.
@ImraneSubstack It sure does, Imrane.
@tgs0376 Glad it was helpful, Tom!
@AlastairDigby Love that.
If you're publishing content daily, remember:  - 75% of your followers didn't see it - 80% of your followers won't remember - 100% of your new followers never saw it  Repurpose often.  Nobody remembers your content like you remember your content.
@fabgiovanetti @sangeet_kar @brennandunn @MeetKevon @altmarkschool Thanks! 🙏

@jose_edil The best start would just be to teach kids that it's an option.  Then potentially some basics around market, problem solving, testing solutions, etc.  Real light. But expose them to the thought process behind it. I think it would do wonders eve
@chrislouvion I'd argue most teachers are better entrepreneurs than the people who put "entrepreneur" in their Twitter bio because they once helped a friend for free 🤷‍♂️
@jose_edil Who cares? That's not a reason to decide that we won't introduce the basics.  None of my teachers were world-renowned mathematicians but they gave me the basics of math.
@busbybrian1 @BradSpencer Wait...I'm just asking a question out loud here. How did I earn that response?
@CPASuperHero @fiverr Math, history, and science aren't "one thing" either.  I'm talking the basics
@Tribute392 @techladyallison We teach Math in schools and we don't have a world full of Mathematicians.
@BradSpencer That's what I'm thinking. It doesn't need to be overly complex.  Just the basics.
@daytonmills Best answer.
@bewellwithnikki Yeah, that is dope and I meant the concept. Exactly.  Just plant the seeds, ya know?
@TheWritingGuru That's awesome. I just feel like there is some way to mold these behaviors earlier.   I'd love to see more people say what you say. Ya know?
@BradSpencer Sure, but we teach it in college. Why is it so crazy to assume we could go down a level?
@Hi_AndrewWilson That's awesome to hear!
@geoff_l I know lots of entrepreneurs that head down to Stanford, Booth, Wharton, etc. and teach regularly.
@pmontu33 @MySuccessTheory Right, but that’s a cop out. Just because you can’t learn everything about entrepreneurship in a classroom doesn’t mean we shouldn’t expose people to the ideas.
@mgsdisha It’s weird that all of Twitter says, “You can’t learn entrepreneurship in school” but proceeds to spend hours per day trying to learn it in less than 280 characters.
@daltonkjensen The same way it’s taught in colleges and universities across the world but at a more basic level.
@guerrist I’m surprised by some of what people are saying. Sure entrepreneurship is learned by doing (edgy comments!) but why not expose people to the thought process earlier?
@techladyallison I think this is the answer.
@garydarna That’s probably a good reason why.
@andrewamann That’s not true at all. It’s taught in tons of colleges. Why not expose kids earlier?
@Tobieh87 Right but that doesn’t mean we can’t include it in the curriculum.
@SergioRocks Sure but colleges like Stanford teach it. Why not just expose kids to the concepts earlier?
Why don't more high schools teach entrepreneurship?
@NYR_Blueshirt Maybe. Great idea.
@davemcg3 Yep. I use this framework:  https://t.co/6IZTcuY0nW  I just expand the site as I get questions/feedback.
@SergioRocks So much so. I love working out and thinking.
@podfixer101 Same.
@TheFrederique Yep. Shower I get panicked because I have a good idea and no pen 😂
@TheMoney_Wizard Haha. Sorry man.
@Sajal_O I do.
@uxcrafter I'd listen to that.
@touseefcodes Try with a friend or a dog :)
@Automated_Rev Sounds like I'm in pretty good company then.
@thejosephmurray Thanks, James!
@alexcoderTX Looks like our park here and we also have a crane. Weird!
@JasonSpears It just might be.
@JasonHershman Agreed!
@alexcoderTX Is this Shelby Bottoms park in Nashville?
@MiaKiraki Love it, Mia. 🔥
@adamkreek I love that. If I had a better back I might try it!
@RikNieu I've been writing about it for years and the responses to my writing have provided enough validation to at least presell.
Brainstormed a new product during a 6-mile walk with my wife today.  - Domain purchased - MVP site in progress - Launching in 12 days  Taking walks is a business cheat code.
@copyandcheese No. And I will never sell you crypto. It’s an impostor and a scam.
@tomfallowfield @sangeet_kar @arvidkahl @MeetKevon @brennandunn @david_perell @hellofailory @AlexLlullTW @peeplaja Thank you, Tom!
@YanceySanderson Sure thing.  I have a system for producing content quickly and efficiently.  I have a system for automating my community onboarding.  Just 2 examples.
@dickiebush Love the "read out loud" part.  I do this for every newsletter and I catch "tough to understand" parts right away.  Great advice, Dickie.
@austinbelcak This is the attitude.  When a friend releases a product, I buy it nearly every time.  Let's support each other out here for crying out loud.
@McLovin_Murat One of my favorite sayings.
@CarolLRead Same here, Carol!
@dklineii Same here. Time audit for friction.
@ScottWRobinson Yep. Give it to a random person at Sbux and pay 'em.
@dennis_geelen For sure. Eliminate, automate, delegate, systematize.
@TheMBA_coach Thank you so much. I appreciate that.   Trying to only post helpful stuff.
@austinbelcak Yep. Get the systems in place as early as possible and as you scale, you can grow on top of them.
@MentalWeapons Same here.
@aurasky_ Very far.
@TheMBA_coach I'm going to be releasing something really soon that dives super deep into how I systematize everything.
@hey_dhruv I love it, Dhruv.
@markospri Yep. And with systems, you have to think less and less to get things accomplished.
@AliQOfficial Anything that can't be eliminated or automated should be systematized to the extent it can be.
@BrandonFluharty Love that comment, Brandon. I know you're a systems guy.
@TnvMadhav 🔥
@NikolausPatel Love this, Nikolaus. Did you create it?
Solopreneurs can't rely on work ethic.  Instead:  - Eliminate what you can - Automate as much as possible - Build out systems for leftover work - Execute your systems every single day  Motivation eventually falters.  Systems rarely do.
@dickiebush @dickiebuch I've had literally, no joke, over 30 impostors in the last 12 weeks.   It's getting ridiculous.
@thisiskp_ It's definitely a big part of the growth, and probably the most challenging piece to stay committed to.   I missed this week!
@Pikachu8084 Sounds good. LMK when you come over.
@farzalistudios Thanks!
@copyforcreators Well, thanks!
@OneJKMolina It really can be. Most good things usually are, ya know?
@tgs0376 No strict definition. Just people with a lot of followers in a similar space to me
@CharlesWeill I would just spend a ton of time on @harrydry's website called  https://t.co/ZVbx6xdGPr
@SeanAnthonySays I figured this would be up your alley.
@CoachMacUK Yes, definitely. It just requires zooming out and remembering that not everyone is focused on the same things with the same commitment.
@LazerFocus_ I just don't interact with my published content when I go on vacation. Or I carve our 45 minutes and interact.  My courses sell on their own, I don't need to show up.
@cesartastic Same here. Will always be a WIP
@StevenTrister It's critical today...
@storymentor Yep. And you must be able to turn attention into income.
@joe_portsmouth Thank you so much for the kind mention here, Joe. Much appreciated. 🔥

@DylanReidTweets Just chat in the comments or DM when appropriate.
@arvidkahl @paritydeals @SachinNeravath Yes! Been looking for something like this. Perfect timing.
@mattheytens @Twitter I've been impersonated more than 30 times in one month. It's exhausting.
@TheDylanCulbert I never have. I just don't like gimmicks. I write like I talk and I don't talk with hashtags.
@danthewolfe @ShaunEls I don't DM people with threads. I find that awkward. I just hope the value of the thread stands on it's own.
@RichardWBown It's all about consistency, having a plan, and learning to write well.
@speedmindset It's certainly more wide open. Go grab it, and if you don't like it, I'll refund you 110%.
@Alkaabycrypto I don't speak with hashtags, so I don't write with them.
@abhikalanz Get some sleep :)
@junwu_noon If it's helpful.
@janahan888 Appreciate that, Janahan!
@dennis_geelen Most good things are pretty simply executed.
@aminepreneur You are welcome. Thanks for reading.
@nikitalall7 Perfect. Glad you enjoyed it.
@premiumtools_ke Thank you.
@JasonHershman Great! So glad it's helpful.
@ShaunEls I think lots of people complain while threads continue to do extremely well.  I don't listen to complainers. I listen to the market.
@copyandcheese It's been a fun journey for sure, Ricardo.
@marklebrunn Sure thing, Mark!
@chelyn_briand Twitter is a bit more difficult, but you accelerate much faster if you figure it out.
@SergioRocks A combo of both, to be honest. Sometimes, I just comment. Other times, I find something to take to DM.
@ergestx Not if you build out systems to make it easier.
I’ve Tweeted 157 days in a row.  And added 49k+ followers.  Here are 4 simple lessons learned:  1. Share one useful tip each morning. 2. Comment under large accounts. 3. Engage with 5 people daily. 4. Write 1 thread per week.  That's it.  Hope that's helpful.
@_SchusterDev That earns a follow 😀
@_SchusterDev Mind reporting him?
@_SchusterDev It's an impostor. Sorry, my friend.
@mahmoodb I make mine affordable, but not free.  There's no right answer for tech.

@joannawills_ This is such a great comment, Joanna. I've been there too.
@keyurkumbhare 100%. Those looking for "easy" are looking for the wrong thing.
@hey_dhruv That you can grow with.
@ThePupOfWallSt Exactly. Everything is hard, so might as well make it something worthwhile.
@natolisnuggets Yup.
@aurasky_ Exactly. Should I write or record video?  Whichever one you'll stick with.
@instastrategist For sure. Might as well go for upside.
@tomberryCD Boom.
Every job is hard.  Pick the "hard" with the big upside.
@mikefutia Haha. Moral of the story?   There's no "right" way. Congrats on the massive number! :)   I did mine through LinkedIn 👀
@mikefutia I'm about to cross $700k in course sales almost none of it comes from email. All social.
@adammarx13 @BootstrapBro @austinbelcak  https://t.co/p91ONzb3mb
@BootstrapBro @adammarx13 @austinbelcak That's how I started.
@arshadiswriting I love that about it.
@igorbenic 100%, Igor.
@si_abang_tim @austinbelcak Absolutely, Austin. I can't code, and I still built this business on my own without hiring developers or anything.
@Bunbeau1 Agreed. I just think that mix will shift over time.
@tgs0376 It's a game-changer for sure, Tom.
@IAM10Mindset 100%.
@Bunbeau1 Totally. But the old will fade over time as technology works to keep things out of our feeds and inboxes.
@aurasky_ Right. You need a skill and to identify who can benefit from your teaching.
@ShaunEls Definitely. I like it too.
@jlogic Having a community is part of the relationship-building process today. Very helpful.
@lordklukpui Yes. Just presell and validate with simple tools.
@adammarx13 @austinbelcak Fancy websites are a time suck. Start simple with something like Carrd and once you've proven you can make money online, then maybe move.
@imtreyshields Oh, good to hear :)
@robertmooneyubs @RobbieCrab @dickiebush Nice! Welcome in.
@dennis_geelen Crazy talk.
@DevLinguistic It's a lot more personal and connected.
@keyurkumbhare 100%, Keyur. It happens faster than ya think.
@Sajal_O I like that, Sajal.
@hey_dhruv The times are a changin'
@abhikalanz Welcome :)

@CarolynneAlex And the psychology.
@junwu_noon 100%.
@vvilltaylor Great list, Will. 🔥
@1amitarora Barrier to entry has never been lower.
@lordklukpui That's the ticket right there, Lord.
If you can influence people online, you have a head start on entrepreneurship.
@TheFalanBlake It was sent on Twitter.
@fredtheinvestor If I hadn't already quit my job, this might have done it.
@PropertyHelp4U Is it though?
@web3paloma My newest GTM strategy.
@DrivingCS Seems legit though.
@weirdlyy_funnyy Caught me off guard a bit too.
@shivi_jalota It's stone cold.
@ThePupOfWallSt Obviously not.
@HeyJimBurgess My new CTA.
@Tobieh87 Definitely. Let your audience (and the data) guide you.
@JackSaaS Start paying!
@wtravishubbard Lol. And a car.
@_alexbrogan You just gotta have the right strategy.
@SebDugudae Aggressive.
@mikepsecuritee This made me laugh hard.
@serenaded_ The ol' "Gimme some money" trick.
@TheMBA_coach I might try it. Bold.
How to make $1,000 per day on the internet.  Few people understand this.  https://t.co/g6NXfpN789
@Creator_Coach I just listen to my audience and look at the data. Quantitative + qualitative feedback.
@HeyJimBurgess @DevLinguistic Thanks so much, Jim! Keep going...you're never really "finished".
@KushShah9492 Definitely. Create for a year and it will likely find you.
@_alexbrogan Build systems vs. winging it.
@TheSaaSMantra Learn to write about what your customers care about.
@DevLinguistic Right. Play the long game, ya know?
@keyurkumbhare Sounds like common sense, but it isn't.
@MentalWeapons 100%. Your customers write your landing page.
Building a new income stream is simple, not easy.  My advice?  Don't overcomplicate it:  - Create valuable content for a year - Listen to what questions people ask - Solve their question with a digital asset - If they need more, offer a short coaching call  Back to basics.
@jefflin_persis Thanks, Jefflin!
@ovstoica @uxcrafter @SimonHoiberg @arvidkahl @tdinh_me Thanks, man!
@Natalie_Furn Wonderful! So happy to have ya.
@yashasvishailly Yeah, that's a great point :)
@AuthorOnTheSide Ooh. I love that quote.
@MentalWeapons It's one of the best things you can hear because it allows you to operate more freely.
@websitemarketer Definitely. The faster you understand this, the more likely you are to put yourself out there.
@TnvMadhav Push it out there.
The upside of Tweeting about your business:  • More intrigue • More attention • More conversations • Better feedback loop  The downside is what people will think of you.  Once you realize they don't, the downside goes away.
@capt_nandu @xsgames_ @ModestMitkus @aaditsh @warikoo @IAmPascio @AtulACleaver Thank you!

@kimdoyal Thanks so much for the shout-out, Kim!
@madsbrodt Amazing! Keep that going, Mads 🔥
@drernestomd 100%. I feel good when I share my wins. I feel better when I read others.
@okcmayor Hell yeah!
@keyurkumbhare Hang with people who root for your success.
@leslietcreates Yep. Everyone, please share!
@DevLinguistic That's a really interesting way to look at it, Arthur.
@hey_dhruv They almost always are, IMO.
@dikshayaar I love seeing others win.
More people should share wins online.  What feels like a brag can be an inspiration for others.  So if you aren't already, please start sharing those milestones.
@ThePupOfWallSt Thank you, my man!
@lordklukpui Thank you so much, Lord.
@AuthorOnTheSide I started after I hit about $15k.

@podfixer01 Thanks so much for being a customer, David. I appreciate it.
I did $90,351 in a 28-day presale for my last course.  And I followed 6 steps to do it.  Nothing complicated. All simple.  That's what my Saturday newsletter is about this week.  Join 12,127 motivated readers below👇🏻   https://t.co/aDLc4MN2pZ  https://t.co/iv9wO9Ldq3
@arvidkahl And you as well! I appreciate it, Arvid.  In a really cruel world, it feels like anyone building something meaningful should support others doing the same.  Hell, everyone should. Not just creators.
@_ahmedzaidi @simonsinek I agree 1000%. I'm out here rooting for everyone.
@mattragland Great thread, Matt! Rooting for you as always. Been great to get to know you this past year 🙏
Less time listening to experts.   More time listening to customers.
@victor_bigfield @gumroad Crossed $500k there recently.   https://t.co/4tJ1SpowfB
@heyeaslo Woah. Killer work, my man. A bright future!
@Nicolascole77 @heyeaslo Super epic. Wow.
@IAM10Mindset I like The Minimalist Entrepreneur by @shl
@Kringle I'm creating my own ecosystem of folks who collaborate.
@Growth_Corner Exactly. Or "this is how Twitter SHOULD be".   Let the market decide.
@slakhyani76 It certainly is, Shushant.
@wardy0006 100.
@keyurkumbhare Too many short-sighted folks here on Twitter.
If tearing down other creators is part of your growth strategy, you're ngmi.
@ChrisSamp1 Always. Engagement is table stakes.
@Pranay199716 Naval is a good example and his famous "How to get rich (without getting lucky)" thread is a great piece that makes people think.
@gregorycampion Thank you, Greg!
@Natalie_Furn @RichaaVaid More content creators should study human psychology.
@shivi_jalota Keep going for it, Shivi!
@kyork20 100% true, Kyle.
@austinbelcak Absolutely. Happy Friday, my man. 🙌
@IAM10Mindset Write, then cut 30%.
@1amitarora 100%.
@RichaaVaid Yes, but many people give and never build an audience or build one very slowly. Create this type of content and you're more likely to grow faster.
@keyurkumbhare Exactly. Understand human psychology and you're much more likely to win.
@MentalWeapons Damn. I might steal it :)
If you're creating content, remember:  - Educate people - Entertain people - Make people think - Empathize with people  Specific outcomes, not spray and pray.

@jtunes1978 @gaganbiyani @BenKogut @Levijameshere @sweatystartup @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @araskin Thank you so much. In the company of people I very much respect. 🙌
@schimmeljonas Nailed it, Jonas.
@nerdjfpb Exactly. Reading 50 books doesn't help. Reading one and executing on it usually does.
@hey_dhruv Or the wrong one and then figuring out why you were wrong :)
@shivi_jalota Exactly, Shivi.
@SergioRocks Yep. Reading is great. Trying is better.
@e_stradella This is the one I read.
Don't read every book on entrepreneurship.  Instead, read one.  Then:  1. Create some attention online 2. Talk to your prospective customers 3. Listen to the problems they want to solve 4. Build the lightest MVP possible to solve them  Entrepreneurship is learned through action.
@chrisvconley @JasonHershman Agreed on the valuation part, especially because most of my revenue is non-recurring, non-software.  Give me some time though :)
@JasonHershman Damn. This is awesome. Massive appreciation, Jason 🙌🏻
@Josh_G_Roth And why am I featured? I’ve never led SDRs and I’m not even in SaaS anymore. I guess I’ll take it?
@tomgarcy Google calendar and notion.
@tomosman  https://t.co/q9kUhqh3d7
@tomosman Yep. Some of the biggest wastes of my time are productivity apps. Just say no more and stay organized.
No productivity app will save you if you can't learn to say no.
@khurramnaik Reboost
@keyurkumbhare Anywhere and anyone in the world
@TheFalanBlake Love that 🙌🏻
@FaisalFarooqui Totally. Or 2.
@hey_dhruv 💯 Dhruv
If you’re employed you can still:  - Consult - Freelance - Write eBooks - Create video courses - Run a paid community - Write a paid newsletter - Do cohort-based coaching  The barrier to entry has never been lower.  The potential to replace your salary has never been higher.

@Michael39069459 Exactly, Michael.
@keyurkumbhare 💯 You nailed it, Keyur.
Bad online business:  • No content focus • Zero trust-building • Missing a community • "Buy my stuff" sales strategy  Great online business:  • Focused content • Trust building newsletter • Community focused on one goal • Products and services that help people reach it

@thealexbanks Great stuff, Alex. Thanks for including me here 🙌🏻
@William3Willis Interesting is a non-negotiable.
@austinbelcak Yep. Start with step one and then improvise over time.
@ThePupOfWallSt The blueprint is already there. Study it!
@GianSeehra Definitely. You must believe in something!
@vvilltaylor Haha. Thanks, Will.
@TheMBA_coach Absolutely is.
@ash_lmb Thanks for reading them!
@theTonyNash I feel that.
@ENowoslawski Certainly.
@theyashjha 💯 discipline creates habits.
@writer_xoemxo Absolutely Em.
Behind every successful creator is a:  ∙ Strong opinion ∙ Commitment to their craft ∙ Simple product value ladder ∙ System for producing content  I don't care who I've talked to.  Everyone has these in some form.  That's why it's so important to study others.
@antony_chacko15 Thanks, Antony!
@okcmayor Damn. Nice work. Thanks for doing this. Super impressive 🙌🏻
Something I ask myself every day:  "What if I fail as a solopreneur?"  The worst outcome is I go back to work. The best outcome is the exact life I want to design.  Decent downside. Massive upside.   Remind yourself of your optionality daily.
@SheikhNaveed Because when you try to serve everyone, you compete with everyone.
@SheikhNaveed Information and entertainment are drivers. This is informative.
@KateBour @brandondigital @jspector @ImSamThompson @dickiebush @Nicolascole77  https://t.co/qeP3MfeLRu
@aurasky_ I wrote a whole guide about it:  https://t.co/TwgI63yXsp
@1amitarora Definitely. But especially for first timers.
@keyurkumbhare Yep. Money is usually an outcome. But you still have to ask.
@austinbelcak Love that. Having lots of prospects conversations also allows you to refine your pitch and therefore close more business.  Good stuff, Austin.

@Shusmo @testimonialto Thanks for such a wonderful testimonial, Khaled. Much appreciated 🙌🏻
@Jeffrey_Funk Thanks so much for your support and sharing, Jeff! Cheers, my man.
@Alec_Coughlin Thank you, my man. Much appreciated 🔥
@Tochicreatesart 🍾
@sourav_sinha Yep. Not easy but worth it.
@natolisnuggets Over everything.
@keyurkumbhare Better all around.
The solopreneur playbook:  - One niche - 1,000 true fans - One solvable problem - One systematized solution  Everything else is just overcomplication.
@jessievbreugel @NiharikaSodhi @AlexLlullTW @arvidkahl @samanthademers Thanks, Jessie! Appreciate man.
@wardy0006 Amazing. Thank you!
@TheWritingGuru Look fwd to hearing your feedback.
@theyashjha Sweet! So glad to hear, Yash
@robdwillis Pick one and master the nuances. Then move.
@bushwik Ha. That feels like forever ago. But it wasn't. Thanks for following along this whole time.
@saigalsneha Oh, great, Sneha. Glad it was helpful!
@sladeerickson Thanks, Slade!
@zachweismann It would be disingenuous to say it wasn't helpful. But I'm not sure it's the primary driver.  I haven't asked LI followers to follow me on Twitter more than maybe one time.  I think the game plan I laid out in the newsletter is accurate, but
@jmcmillen89 Thanks, my man. So pumped to hear you’re reading it.
@brennan_decker Thank you!
What's your #1 writing tip for Twitter?
@ioanabirleanu You rock. Thanks so much!
@austinbelcak Thank you so much, my man 🙌🏻
@dennis_geelen So appreciative. Thanks, Dennis.
@captainbayes Glad you enjoyed it, Mike!
@Nbundzinski1 Oh great! So glad you enjoyed it.
@natolisnuggets Heck yeah. Glad it was helpful!
@katairobi Appreciate you, Robert. 🙌🏻
@SullyBusiness Thanks, Bryant!
I added 44,716 Twitter followers in 18 weeks.  I break down how in my newsletter today.  📈  Grab it here →  https://t.co/D3kOWfHoW6
@IamBehnam_ Essentialism by Greg McKeown.
@seempaq The golden rule.
@caan_al 💯
@buewho Same. I still want to get better at it.
@keyurkumbhare Every minute of every day.
This is why I say "no" to 90% of what comes my way.  https://t.co/gEYT0Kn3Hj

@hanno_roedger @Tobieh87 Yep. just go to  https://t.co/64c9clqIuz and click newsletter
@edchuchaisri No preference. Ghost is beautiful though.
@IAM10Mindset I didn't really, but I love the fact that it keeps spam down.
@keyurkumbhare 100%. And don't opt people in who didn't truly sign up for that specific thing.
@muthukishor Correct.
@ItsKieranDrew Definitely love #3. Forgot to mention that.
@austinbelcak Smart move, Austin. Good call here.
@Tobieh87 Thanks so much my man!
@kimwillishere Helps keep the list tight.
@CoachMacUK Get it, Mac.
@thetrunkgym Nice Coach!
My newsletter has a 65% open rate.  With 13k subscribers, that seems good.  Here are 4 simple lessons I learned in the last 9 weeks.  1. Clearly define who it's for 2. Clearly define what they'll get 3. Require people to double opt-in 4. Keep it short - less than a 4-minute read
@MarketingMax @alxberman Appreciate it, Max. 🙌🏻
@dickiebush @typeshare_co Dude. Just saw the DM. Love it!  So pumped to give it a try.   Lemme beta test on LI.
@jspector One of my new faves. Thanks, Josh!
@alxberman @stephenpratley Appreciate the shout, Stephen. Cheers.
@trop_artistry Because it is true.
@karlastarr This made me laugh 😂
@Hayden_Feral Look at your GDrive or Notion and there's likely a document or process or system that you use that would be worth money to people.
@keyurkumbhare Easy peasy.
@CoachMacUK Appreciate that, Coach!
@LanceEinerson Not a pro move.
@mcgillmd921 Probably $5k
Everyone has at least $1,000 of side income just sitting on their GDrive.
@sankalpdomore Not starting 5 years earlier. Wasting too much time on tech.
@NatashaTynes Thanks so much, Natasha. I appreciate you sharing.
@JoeHolka Thanks so much. I appreciate that!
@TheMeerShahid Everyone feels lost in the beginning. You just need a plan, and to test against it. Then analyze and try again.
@JoeHolka Sure. Probably a great way, this was just based on what I do.
@reesemojica Yep. Long game!
@aaronhayslip Also a great option. No "right" way to do it, this is just how I do it. Podcasts are probably awesome for that.
@yourpalomar I read 2 newsletters: One daily, and one that comes to me on Saturday over coffee.
@hiyabodhi Correct. Nothing is "for sure". Just increased and decreased likelihoods.
@keyurkumbhare Love that, Keyur. Get your foundation right.
If you're a solopreneur, remember:  - Social content builds attention - Long-form guides/newsletters build trust - Community builds long-lasting relationships  Invest in these 3 things, and revenue is a likely outcome.
@TheSalBshow So do it in a way that you don’t find cringey. At some point, you’ll just have to get over that. Ya know?
@StevenTrister Yep. The ol' presell lesson. :) Been there.
@TheSalBshow Cool. Best way is to go help a company in exchange for proof. I did that early on. Do a few projects. Get proof. Then use your NDA'd company as part of the story and social proof but use the numbers from the clients you helped.
@CoachMacUK  https://t.co/5WTEZ1sxEA
@TheSalBshow What do you do for a living?
@CoachMacUK Definitely. Screwing things up has a real way of making the next version so much better.
@allisonbraley @washingtonpost Here's $1,800 to not do something that will likely be a critical part of growing any meaningful business in the future should you decide to build one.  Smart.
@ShaunEls @jessievbreugel This is the nicest kind of compliment I can get. Thank you.
@simmons_m I feel those. I look back at copy from 3 years ago and yikes.
@TheSalBshow Ask a few here and I'll do my best to answer.
@BenjaminPutano My life has gotten significantly easier since I learned the importance of systems. Highly agree here.
@CoreyWilksPsyD This was me 3 years ago. I did this every single time. I still find myself getting stuck on this.   Tough habit to break.
@GeoffTRoberts Ooh. Did that before :)
@chrisojones Yep. Starting earlier is always my anaswer.
@CoachMacUK Been there, done that.
@thetrunkgym Always mine...
@KHendersonCo Ahh. Damn. Just send me a DM and I'll say "SHIP IT!"
@CarolynneAlex How did you apply this next time? Great lesson to learn.
@MontanaOvikian @aaditsh Thank you, Montana!
@clayton_cheddr Yep. Test first, then invest. I've made this mistake.
@gentoftech Yep. Audience first, then productize/serve.
@umut_sonmez Solo channel. That resonates. Why I started on Twitter recently.
@jaysen_sutton Damn. These are 2 that resonate for sure.
@SullyBusiness Always my answer.
@keyurkumbhare Made that early on for sure.
What's the biggest mistake you've made in your online business?
@Shakemktg @joe_portsmouth @nevmed Oh sweet! Thanks!
@OhHeyAlejandro I think so for sure.  Perhaps through email, AMAs, live events, etc.  There's no right way to do it, I just think it's good to be cognizant of the step.
@doradevasher Great stuff, Dora. Thanks for the mention!
@bentossell Such a great thread and cheers to you on the sale, Ben. I’m a makerpad customer and was genuinely so thrilled when this happened. 🥂
@TheWritingGuru Yep. Most of what we give away for free can be monetized. Pretty common to see people forget that.
@GPastural They'll come around :)
@ChanReed_ Exactly, Chan.
@keyurkumbhare The common sense we have isn't always common to others.
One-person business simplified:  - Think of help you've provided for free - Find more people who need that - Charge money instead  It's been there all along.   Asking for $$ makes it a business.
@jessievbreugel Thanks man. I only break it down because I’ve screwed it all up so many times that mistakes become obvious.
@Josh_G_Roth Many hugs and love my friend. Can’t wait to come to SF and hang with you and Cody. Cheers.
@austinbelcak "How I'll do it" is often better than "How I've done it".
@MeetKevon Saying 1 thing, 1,000 different ways will get you significantly further than saying 1,000 things.
@jasonleowsg I had a LinkedIn newsletter and inconsistent blogging. I actually treat certain LinkedIn posts as trust builders as well. Today's is a good example.
@DeniseWakeman @TheTiltNews Thanks for sharing my thread, Denise. Much appreciated. 🙌
@Tobieh87 @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush @RobbieCrab @amandanat @ShaanVP @dvassallo Bringing the heat with these threads, Tobi. Keep 'em coming. 🔥
@damengchen Wait...what?  Hustler 😂
@WesleyRGarner @thisiskp_ I dunno, to be honest.
@thisiskp_ This Tweet should be 100x more popular than it is.  I've never thought of it like that, and I love it.  Great stuff, KP.
@OwenSammarone Sweet. I'll take it :)
@OwenSammarone I did. I wasn't aware of that account.
@Tim_Denning Definitely. Automation is the movement. The relationships and engagement must be genuine.   Good call, Tim.
@jspector This is great.  I love #6 (no lead magnets), #8 (one topic), and #11 (everything is too long).  #3 is one I struggle with. I never had an email list until 9 weeks ago, and I've been able to monetize that non-email "audience".  Great thread. Shar
@schemingbilly I love this, Colin.
@marktenenholtz Trust is the truest way to move someone into a real relationship.   I don't want relationships with authority. I want them with people I trust.
@edchuchaisri I prefer to do everything underneath my own name. Just a preference.
@VladPasca5 Thanks so much, Vlad. I appreciate that.
@digi__yadav Thanks, Digi!
@Nicolascole77 Thanks, Nicolas. I'm sure this exists somewhere already but hell...I'll take it.
@shrutisachdeva Lack of space. I do in the longer form article.
@DevLinguistic 100% Arthur. You nailed it.
@keyurkumbhare Gotta have your audience best interest in mind.
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. RT to share this thread with your audience 2. Check out my deep dive on building your creator funnel here:   https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE
7/ Summary  Get discovered ex: Twitter &amp; LinkedIn ↓ Build trust ex: weekly newsletters ↓ Build relationship ex: community ↓ Monetize ex: online courses
6/ A few additional notes (cont.)  The top of the funnel is where most people fail.  They don't spend enough time getting discovered.  So, in 2022, work on discovery, and then add your trust builder.  Getting these 2 things right makes the latter half of the funnel 10x easier.
5/ A few additional notes  Obviously, none of this matters if you're just focused on monetization.  You have to genuinely care about your audience and their success.  You must deliver high-quality products and, more importantly, results.
4/ Monetization  With a captive audience of supporters, monetization is easier.  You can deliver:  • SaaS • A course • Coaching calls • Cohort-based coaching  And offer it directly through your community.  No algorithm or open rates to deal with.  Just a captive audience.
3/ Relationship building  You can continue to build trust through email.  At some point though, you must move from trust → building relationships.  This is where my community comes in.  Members join to deepen their relationship with me and our other motivated members.
2/ Trust building  Next is turning attention into trust.  Trust meaning, "I trust this person knows their stuff."  My trust builder is my newsletter.  It shows people how I think at a deeper level.  BONUS: It also "de-platforms" my closest followers to my email list.
1/ Discovery  Discovery means getting noticed.  The easiest way is to create where people are consuming.  Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.  And the content that works falls into 3 styles:  - Teach me - Entertain me - Make me think  None of this works without a little attention.
First, why should you care?  The creator funnel is how you build a simple journey for your audience.  There are 4 distinct parts:  - Discovery - Trust building - Relationship building - Monetization  Getting these right maximizes your chance to make a living as a creator.
The Creator Funnel 101  The concept of the "creator funnel" is critical to understanding audience growth, networking, and monetization.  But what is it and how does it work?  Here’s The Creator Funnel 101  🧵
@KeshTFE I think this is the closest thing:   https://t.co/eRuYU20kqZ
@jspector Or that don't actually have a personal brand.
@austinbelcak The world favors the prepared.
@luke_netti Thanks so much, Luke!
@codebeef_ @dickiebush And it's a step that's often skipped.
@eanorv @dickiebush Sure does, Ethan. Gotta nail the whole thing.
@canopassoftware @dickiebush Certainly. Thanks for reading.
@EvergreenMEP @dickiebush Right? No need.
@keyurkumbhare @dickiebush Ooh. Love that, Keyur 🔥
@onebrightblake @abhishekshah173 @austinbelcak Thank you, my man :)
When copywriting, @dickiebush says focus on the big 4:  • Here's your problem • Here's the benefit of solving it • Here's why what you've tried has failed • And here's a product that will help you solve it  Take it from a guy with 165k followers &amp; a booming writing business.
@bssaleeb @dvassallo Yeah totally. I agree 100%.
@dvassallo That makes sense, thanks, Daniel.  Sounds like doing what's reasonable without taking it to an extreme is the way to go.   Realize that's petty much common sense as I type it out.
@dvassallo Curious about your thoughts on preparation vs. paranoia?   The hypochondriac gets legitimately sick one day. I'm not sure their preoccupation is worth it, in the end.
@stephegger You too, my man. Have a great night! 🤝
@stephegger It's a good conversation!  I see lots of people use templates. Marketers, salespeople, authors, musicians, movie writers, etc.  Everyone wants predictability.  It's important (to me) that we don't treat social media creators differently when t
@DrFeresh @fourthbrainai Nice!
@JWellsCFO @stephegger 🤷‍♂️  https://t.co/9OA3w2sIEw
@stephegger Lastly, you were surprised to learn that I (sometimes, by the way) use templates.  Sounds like I couldn't possibly be robotic if it wasn't noticeable.
@stephegger Counterpoint:  James Clear writes his newsletter in the same format every week. A template. Still authentic.  Authentic meals are made with recipes. A template. Still authentic.  I have hundreds of templates, all created by me.  Just vessels t
@stephegger If I have something meaningful to share, putting it into a proven structure doesn’t make it any less meaningful, authentic or genuine.   I find it interesting that people are surprised that I have systems, processes and templates.   This is my
@stephegger If I have proven formulas, absolutely.
@growthcurrency @NatashaTynes @dickiebush @AliAbdaal @ranasweis @david_perell Awesome. Thanks, Natasha!
@Eldavinn_3FA I don't have fear of failing. Failure is a data point. The long game rewards people who keep playing.
@daltonkjensen @Denis__Shatalin @agazdecki Thank you, Dalton!
@brennan_decker Boom! Love that. Congrats.
@bentossell Damn. This is such actionable advice. Perfectly encapsulated.
@ArrigoLupori Yeah I understand that. If you nail the idea though…matters a lot less
@keyurkumbhare Haha. Love that Keyur. True story.
@growthcurrency @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Thanks my man 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Simple solopreneurs win.  1% go from idea to MVP in a day.  99% get stuck:  - Trying to find the coolest domain name - Crowdsourcing opinions from strangers - Running polls to pick the "right" software - Designing a logo before they have anything to sell  Ship. Then complicate.
@e_stradella I like the templates built into Typeshare. They make thread ideas easy. I love Hypefury too. I use it every day.
@guyfosel Thanks, Jon! I’ve got distribution so I figured I might as well use it.
@dickiebush @typeshare_co Bring it on. I’ll be your happiest customer. Can’t wait! 👏
@leemarkum @thecodinghigh Thanks, Lee!
@vvilltaylor I use the $49/month plan (don't remember what it's called) because I can cross-post to LinkedIn.
@Tobieh87 @amandanat Great stuff, Tobi. Thanks so much for featuring me here. I greatly appreciate it 🙌
@adammarx13 Same. Organizing them with Twitter blue has been best.
@ericwallcopy Welcome!
@gregoryjhickman It's where I build out all of my writing templates.
@andrewmcbarnett  https://t.co/IJmc2ZlQgV
@rajkbnp Nice. It's best in Twitter Blue where you can organize different folders.
@randomshenans Ha. Works for some, I'm sure.
@EvergreenMEP It's great for threads (and articles too)
Sharing on Twitter has never been easier.  Here are 4 tools I use to streamline the process:  - Notion for templates - Bookmarks for inspiration - Hypefury to schedule &amp; publish - Typeshare for Twitter thread ideas  Systems make it more likely that you'll stay consistent.
@EvansNifty Absolutely found this fascinating to watch. What a cool skill you have.
@EvansNifty This is amazing! Thank you for this.
@evielync @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Thanks for watching, Ev!
@GDeckernews Good stuff, Geoff. Glad my comment helped! 🙌
@brendanjshort @heydannymiranda I say the community space still needs a true all-in-one player on the synchronous side. I'd pick Discord.  Async, Circle/MN seems to be the way to go, but they lack engagement.
@Tobieh87 Well that sounds pretty awesome. Thanks! 🙏
@timcroft 👆🏻 This is the formula. Go back 2-3 years and think about who you were and what you wish you knew. That's the stuff right there.
@divyak316 It's definitely incorrect. Glad you realized it.
@GianSeehra Certainly a helpful way to look at it.
@gobienan Just impostor syndrome. You know more than you think.
@hSanat @sivers He's one of my all-time favorites.
@Matt_Mastando Absolutely. Thanks for reading it, Matthew.
@keyurkumbhare Yep. Consider where you were 2-3 years ago, and build things for that person.
Reminder to all solopreneurs:  Something very obvious to you is worth a lot of money to someone else.  Have a great Sunday.
@GDeckernews @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush This is awesome. Thanks, Geoff!
@andymewborn Thanks man :) It feels natural given my background. I'm thankful for the past for sure.
@Shusmo @ElfaidiAyata Thanks, my man 🙌
@EvergreenMEP Yep. My background is a CRO, so this basically comes from running sales teams.
@Shusmo Much appreciated, Khaled 💪
@BrandonGrittini I love hearing that. My goal is to break things down to their most simple core. I hope that's working!
@BrandonGrittini Thanks so much, Brandon!
@keyurkumbhare Exactly. That's what a good funnel does.
A "creator funnel" is a powerful framework for building an audience, gaining trust, and earning income online.  My newsletter breaks it down from top to bottom today.  Grab it here →  https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE  https://t.co/XOXIk4FGoq
@jasonsmcc Thank you so much, Jason!
@arvidkahl The amount of time people spend looking for shortcuts is certainly puzzling.  Pick a channel for growth, try it, and then analyze and shift.   Over time, you'll learn everything you need to know about it.  Then pick another.
@TheCoolestCool @jspector @Kjellvdv @ThisIsSethsBlog @TimFerrissShow @stephsmithio @JamesSchramko @FerraroOnAir @thedankoe Appreciate the kind shout, Josh! 🙌 @thedankoe also happens to be a really good interviewer.  All credit to him.
@tomfallowfield @CharlotCrowther @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @arvidkahl It was a great comment. No “right” way to do it so the more options, the merrier! 💪🏻
@BriceTrophardy @ship30for30 @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Thanks for joining, Brice! I hope you love the course 🔥
@CharlotCrowther @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 There is little point in building a product if there is no audience to buy it.  Getting discovered is, above all, the most important part of the funnel (IMO).
@mattragland @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Had a great time. Looking fwd to chatting with you later today, Matt. 🙌
@NatashaTynes @hypefury @getshieldapp @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Thanks for tuning in, Natasha 🙌
@yytambaya_ Bingo. Nailed it.
@swaycopy Ha. See? I'm not full of shit.
@McLovin_Murat @dennishegstad I don't agree that not "everyone can do it".   We never say that about any other profession.
@IAM10Mindset No right answer. It's whatever you want to do with it.
@thegoldsuite Definitely. There is no "right" way to do it.  But if you have a skill from work that's in demand, and you don't have anything in your contract preventing you from servicing others...  Great way to start.
@MentalWeapons @Tobieh87 If you have a skill, go sell that skill on the market. That's all I mean.
@dennishegstad I think people tend to fall into 2 camps when trying:  1. Wild overcomplicaters: Have 13 pieces of tech before they even make a dollar.  2. Fast-movers: Don't even have a landing page, just send an invoice via Stripe.  The latter is so much
@Matt_Mastando It's a much safer way to get started.
Side hustles before solopreneurship.  Here's how to start your first one:  1. Take whatever thing you do at your work 2. Talk about that thing every day online 3. Find people who need that thing 4. Do that thing for them too  Congrats. You have a side hustle.
@chddaniel @NatashaTynes @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Ha. I'm much less cool than I look. But thank you.
@MountainCopy @dickiebush @WrongsToWrite @writingtoriches @GrammarHippy @ItsKieranDrew @jakevictor_ @The1stReporter Thanks for the shout, Bill!
@Yannick_Veys Sorry I’m late.
@Josh_G_Roth LinkedIn Influencers are dead.
@NatashaTynes @rainar_angelo @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Thank you!
@andrewbryder This is 100% true.
@simplify_thrive 100%. We must learn to accept as well.  If all we do is give and feel bad about receiving, we're missing our opportunity to allow others to give to us.
@moonfactorapp It is the case. If it's not resonating, try helping in a different way. What you find helpful and valuable may not be to others.
@SergioRocks Awesome. Just followed.
@ShaunEls Exactly. You can build an incredible network simply by helping time after time.
@JackSaaS The people that treat it that way generally lose...
@schemingbilly Love this, Colin. Even if it's small, people will continue to say your name...
@luke_netti Yep. Usually in high multiples.
@William3Willis I've found it comes back in high multiples, which is the whole point.
Solopreneurship is a Karma game.  I'm convinced that helping others over the course of your career is the single greatest investment you can make.  Those that succeeded without this are the exception, not the rule.
@SteveBrusell @iamwillcannon @blackhatwizardd @OneJKMolina @agazdecki @microacquire @NathanLatka @awilkinson @theryanking @landforce @JamesonCamp @wizofecom Appreciate the follow, Steve. 🙌🏻
@geoff_l @dickiebush Diversification. New challenge. Different writing style. Completely different people. Etc.
@MentalWeapons @ecomchasedimond @blackhatwizardd @SeanAnthonySays Good stuff, Max! Keep 'em coming.
@dickiebush Tweeting.
@jmikolay  https://t.co/VajHvvdMFJ
@Pavlos__21 I didn’t say there was anything wrong with it.
@victor_bigfield Me too. But I often find myself working hard.
@VibhorChandel Sometimes.
@GarreisJonathan Ha. I think a lot of people might.
@RajKSarma Potentially both?
@_grumpypancake_ Nope. It's wrong to tell people one thing while doing the exact opposite.
@William3Willis Oh yeah. Don't forget those check ins.
Most people telling you to "work smart" are workaholics.
@jordangodbey Thanks, Jordan! 🙌🏻
@iamwillcannon Appreciate you, Will! 🙌
@ShaunEls The best.
@EvergreenMEP Yep. That's the best kind of "networking".
@Kunal_KumarJ Nailed it, Kunal.
@Sabahet17 Certainly. But it's easier when you make noise.
@MentalWeapons Definitely, Max.
@codebeef_ Ha. That is pretty funny.
The easiest way to "network" is to do interesting things &amp; attract interesting people.
@dickiebush Damn, now that's a true statement if I've ever heard one.

@_Alex_Adamov Thanks, my man 🙌
@thenocodepro Sometimes I'll reach out to a group of affiliates to coordinate a big day when we all ask. Give them a slightly higher percentage.
@blakeaburge Thank you so much, Blake.  Systems are what keeps me focused and moving in the right direction.  Figured others could benefit from it. Thanks for reading!
@gjsequeira Give people what they are looking for and do it at a very reasonable price.  If you can take someone from point A to point B in 45 minutes, you've saved them time and likely helped make them money.
@the_star_man 1. Whatever you know how to use already.  Gumroad is easiest, Kajabi is most robust.  2. I don't focus on production value really at all.  People want the information.
@Matt_Mastando Definitely. You'll thank yourself in the long run.
@tomfallowfield Thanks, Tom!
@BasRash_ Certainly. Thanks for taking the time to read it.
@SachinRamje Thanks for reading, Sachin!
@damengchen If this thread was helpful, I'd love a RT.  If you want tips like this every Saturday morning,  subscribe to my weekly newsletter →  https://t.co/Bc6J7KbNqS  This Saturday's issue is all about building your "creator funnel".   Cheers 🍻
@damengchen - No 30-day email course. - No abandoned cart emails. - No audience segmentation. - No complicated integrations.  None of these things are bad btw.  They would probably help me increase sales.  But they aren't necessary to start &amp; be succe
@damengchen 8/ Coordinate "ask" days  With helpful content, a great course, impulse pricing, and an army of affiliates, you can do this CRAZY thing to make more sales.  Ask for them. Wild huh?  90% of the time I'm giving, and 10% I'm coordinating "asks" w
@damengchen 7/ Create an army of happy customers who sell  After completing the course, customers receive an invite to become an affiliate.  Because I've driven 100x value, I get a very high adoption rate.  They don't drive a ton of sales, but so far I've
6/ Automate testimonials  When the course is completed, I embed a  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I button inside of the last lesson. (thanks, @damengchen )  The ask is simple. A short video or text testimonial.  Then it automatically gets pumped to my landing page.  https://t.co/ekFeBi8elz
5/ Deliver 100x value  Part of the "impulse buy" strategy is to surprise &amp; delight the customer.  Wow them.  "I spent 2k on a coach in January. Learned more in this $150 course than I did working with them." - Jubal Horton  This is the feedback I'm after 👆🏻  100x value.  https://t.co/Hw2CjBSWuQ
4/ Create urgency with discounts  A simple 25% to 40% expiring discount (24 hours only) drives purchases.  Impulse pricing + expiring deal = sales  I average about $14k in 24 hours when I leverage discounts.  It gets seen by 50k to 80k people.  https://t.co/vTSF3tTKGP
3/ Use "impulse buy" pricing  You don't have the social capital to sell a $1,297 masterclass. Sorry.  When people come across my products, I want them to "pull the trigger" without thinking.  So I make it easy.  $50 to $150  You're building trust. Not trying to get rich.  https://t.co/gTBCTW7L1s
2/ Listen for signals  By creating valuable content, you'll start getting traction.  Look for signals in questions:  - How do you do X? - I'd love to learn more about Y - Can you give me advice about Z?  You want to help people! Answer these to create a simple course that does.
1/ Create content to get discovered  Start by looking backward at your life &amp; career.  Where were you 2-3 years ago?  What do you wish you knew then that you know now?  Turn that into 4 types of content:  1. Educational 2. Entertaining 3. Contrarian 4. Empathetic
Online courses are money-makers.  But contrary to what you've been told, selling them isn't complicated.  THREAD: An 8-step system to more online course sales.  🧵
@austinbelcak 80% give, 20% ask
@dovhyi True. It's not an absolute rule (what I mentioned earlier, I mean).
@dovhyi By understanding your craft deeply.
@Tobieh87 That's right. Study your craft until you know it like the back of your hand.   Confidence comes from being excellent at something.
@tapuzed Mostly talking to people who could be doing big things, but haven't convinced themselves that they "deserve" it.
@jack_retty It's just human instinct.
@_Alex_Adamov Funny how that happens, ya know?
@keyurkumbhare Nailed it, Keyur. But it takes awhile to figure this out.
@victor_bigfield Thanks, Victor. A must-have skill.
The older I get, the more I realize self-confidence makes all the difference.
@AnaBullard4 Thanks, Ana!
@andybrvt1 Here's a thread where I talk about a bunch of steps I went through to grow my business.  These all felt like risks at the time:   https://t.co/3zVqEe0ggx
@benlcollins @arvidkahl 😂
@CoreyWilksPsyD Exactly.  Try things. Analyze. Iterate. Repeat.
@blakeaburge Damn, Blake. This thread is absolute fire.  Understanding and accepting different circumstances is so critical. There are always people with more, and always people with less.  Go out there and perform regardless. People will root for you.
@MennellaNick I'll do a newsletter on it.
@LBacaj Exactly. This is the portfolio of small bets approach. We're speaking the same language here, my man.
@EvergreenMEP I try not to take too many big risks at all. I just take many small ones.
@MennellaNick Launching my community. Pre-selling a course. Writing.
@CSMikeCardona Thanks, Mike!
@arvidkahl Threw my back out...walking.   Welcome to my early 40s.
It feels like 90% of being an entrepreneur is taking small but uncomfortable risks.
@ethanluket @sweatystartup @dickiebush Thanks, Ethan!
@SidelineAff It's the most critical one I feel like...so much more time when you learn to say no.
@dickiebush This is an immediate bookmark. Damn. Good stuff, Dickie.
@dickiebush Write for one person. Create for one person. Solve problems for one person.  It's amazing how 1 becomes many through consistency.
@KagoMario @alexgarcia_atx Great point, Mario.
@OscarLagrosen Thank you, Oscar 🙌
@rosiesherry 👋
@EvergreenMEP Yep. Go deep, not wide to start.
@alexgarcia_atx Clarity &gt; Clever
5 lessons from 2 years of self-employment:  - If you're unsure, say no - Eliminate / automate / delegate - Chase short-term $ → miss long-term $$$ - Kind, optimistic, and positive people win out - You cannot win if you don't enjoy what you do

@JamesonCamp Right back at you. Here we go 🚀
@JamesonCamp Exact same gameplan here. All in.

@blakeaburge @RomeenSheth @jmikolay @SahilBloom @wes_kao @david_perell @anafabrega11 @polina_marinova Appreciate you including me, Blake. Cheers 🍻
@pyewaw @QuodSoler You two nailed it.
@MikeBoelkens 100%, Mike.
@JackSaaS Yep. Failure is just never starting.

@nomadsammey They are both valuable. No specific order.
@srahula That's awesome! Keep it going, man.
@OnlyLearnOnce Critical.
@kevinbooyens And maybe Twitter.
@EvergreenMEP Love this Tweet, Greg.
@igorbenic Haha. Sounds like a decent way to get started though.
@keyurkumbhare Absolutely, Keyur.
@heychazza Definitely. Overcomplication is rampant.
What powers my one-person business:  - Zoom - Twitter - LinkedIn - A website - A newsletter  What doesn't:  - High-end camera &amp; lighting - Sophisticated automation - Professional branding - Email funnels - Paid ads  Start now.  Get complicated later.
@jtunes1978 @jspector @david_perell @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @kaleighf @iainbroome @stewfortier @VeryGoodCopy @annhandley @louisnicholls_ Weird. DM me your email address. I've got 99.9% deliverability and 70% open so you should be getting it.
@TheWritingGuru Your profile is a great example of being extremely clear. Love it.
@mozmour Even for business users, I see the same thing.
99% of Twitter profiles aren't clear:  - What do you do? - What do you Tweet about? - How is your pinned Tweet related? - Why should I press the follow button?  Bring people through the funnel with clarity.
@TheFalanBlake Nice work!
@SachinRamje Right back at you, Sachin.
@SahilBloom 99% of people wake up with the sole intention of furthering beliefs they already have.  If you can embrace an open mind, your growth will only accelerate.
@vvilltaylor Exactly, Will.
@Denis__Shatalin Great tips, Denis 🔥
@rajachirravuri Nice! Keep writing.
@investingdean Start sharing your thoughts online each morning around one specific topic.
Build a brand where people want to follow you and companies want to hire you.  Such incredible leverage.
@thescottleese No joke, Jennifer said this to me a few weeks back.   Would 100% happily pay.
@seempaq It's so simple and very practical.
@jspector It sure doesn't. I know it first hand.
@dvassallo The smallest collection of required tools that you are most familiar with is how I think about technology stacks.  Love this.
@hellokellybrito always.
@gkarims Nice, Karim. Love to hear that. 🙌
@luke_netti Hell yeah, Luke. 🔥
@therealhossain Total toxic burnout. I've learned this (twice).
@Steve_P_Brady I didn't know he was (then wasn't?) on them.
@ADukes21 It's a really good book. Simple and practical.
In a world of unicorns &amp; hustle, I remember this.  https://t.co/Hpvyk7MRfe
@ThePupOfWallSt Thank you, my man. 🙌
@srahula Maybe someday. Not sure of the impact. I hate it too.
@MontanaOvikian Exactly.
@adltyagaur Everyone needs products at different price points to meet the needs of diverse customers.
Modern solopreneurship:  - Work in short sprints - Automate your revenue ladders - Create offers for everyone's budget  The result is more clients, more word-of-mouth, more upsells, and more time with your family.

@DjangoJefe Ask Jeeves.
@KeshTFE Build an audience first.  Look for buying signals. Once people start asking, then toss up a landing page and see who pays.  Don't build something nobody wants to buy.
@ChrisRocas We shall see.
@thebrandanhall Agree, 100%. I also think community owners and folks who want to build communities vastly underestimate the work involved to make a community great.
@theandreboso True story. Working on that now. Just need to get it all straightened out.
@Matt_Mastando Nice, Matthew. It works.
@rpguerreiro Definitely. I'm not an NFT/web3 guy, but I'm certain this is true.
Solopreneurship funnel in 2022:  - Discovery: Twitter - Trust builder: Newsletter - Relationship builder: Community - Automated income builder: Courses
@markedlercpa @SullyBusiness @loom @Superhuman Superhuman seemed focused on punting emails down the road (at least when I used it).  HEY is all about never even receiving emails from people you don't want to get them from.  I absolutely freaking love it.
@markedlercpa @SullyBusiness @loom @Superhuman I tried Superhuman but ultimately moved to HEY.
@sean_specie @BenjaminPutano Gotta go to the judges.  And...allowed.

@SimonHoiberg @stripe Oh damn...of course. Gotta get paid.
@dickiebush 100%.    https://t.co/Lo48PAOQd1
@OneJKMolina @TweetHunterIO Love it. And your account is a testimonial to the product. Keep it going.
@ChrisRocas @NotionHQ Notion in the lead right now...
@cryptotrappy @HeyArunima I'll put it in the queue.
@ReprogramCoach @carrd is so great.
@katairobi It's Google Calendar for me, which makes me very lame I suppose.
@perfexcellent @OmniFocus Not familiar. Why did you choose it?
@HeyArunima Two of my faves.
@CSMikeCardona Good one. I love Zapier.
@BenjaminPutano Same. I think I would choose Google Calendar. How lame 😂
What is the 1 piece of software you can't function without?
@_grumpypancake_ Oh, I love StoryBrand! I wasn't thinking about it when I wrote this but I'm sure there was some influence from it for sure.
@dickiebush God bless. Command+8.  My life has now changed. How did I not know this?
@_grumpypancake_ I'm not sure which book you're referencing. Mind sharing?
@AlexLlullTW @arvidkahl @dickiebush @aaditsh @OzolinsJanis @wngpod Great nuggets here, Alex.  Appreciate the feature, my man. Hope all is well 🔥
@Adhiguna_AIaaS Damn. I love it.  I'll probably steal that 😅
@bricegump Exactly, Brice.
@andyjackcandle @IamAmanKhatri I absolutely love this.
@hellokellybrito Nice, Kelly!
@IamAmanKhatri Exactly. Specifically, what it does.
Online Course Marketing 101:  Your offer should answer: "What, exactly, will customers achieve?"  It's not: "Learn how to invest in the market."  It's: "In less than 1 hour, you'll learn to invest your first $10k in the market without an expensive advisor."  Clarity is critical.

@jmcmillen89 True story. I see it daily.
@olance I plan my content. But I’ve been doing this for 3+ years.   For those who haven’t…just start.
@MontanaOvikian Thanks so much, man. Appreciate it! 🙌
@Denis__Shatalin Keep moving 'em!
@dinofavara Thanks so much, Dino. Much appreciate it, man.
@ChrisRocas I sure hope so!
@bentossell @carrd @zapier @stripe Some of my absolute favorites. Use all of them.

@sparktoro 4/ Create content  Next, it's time to establish credibility.  Here are some easy ways:  - Teardowns - Tweet threads - Step-by-step guides  Show the people 2-3 years behind you that you understand their challenges &amp; have solved them before. 
3/ Find the "you" from 2-3 years ago  Your goal is to find people who are just like you, but much earlier in their journey.  Where do they hang out online? Try places like:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - FB Groups  If you can't find them, use tools like @sparktoro to help.
2/ Identify your interests  Inside of the list you just created, will be things you loved doing and hated doing.  Sorry, but you can't scale misery.  Choose something you built skills in, that you also enjoy doing/talking about/writing about.  This will be your core focus.
1/ Eliminate the "fallacy of expertise"  When you get started, you can't worry about "am I an expert?"  If you do, you'll never get started.  Instead, make a list of your accomplishments, big and small, over the last 2-3 years.  What skills did you learn during this period?
How to build your first 2 income streams:  (without knowing how to code)  🧵
Don't create a content calendar, write one draft. Don't start a business, help one customer. Don't build a course, finish one lesson.  Small wins, in aggregate, become big wins.  Start small today.
@Alex_Swenson14 @AmandaMGoetz Appreciate you! Dinner on me.
@andyparks83 @AmandaMGoetz @sweatystartup Thank you, my man. Dinner on me when I come to Cape Town. 🍷
@Nicolascole77 Amazing! Congrats ❤️
@keyurkumbhare I knew what you meant!
@ChrisSamp1 I don't know your product, but I don't care how the "sausage is made".   AI or some random person hacking it together. Matters not.  Just results.
@LanceEinerson Lol. Love that. So true.
@OnlineToolGeek Smart tech nerd. I feel the same.
@drojasug And build more customers.
@dubovetzky No they don't. They love clarity written in words that are easy to understand.
@LBacaj And your customers will thank you!
@CoreyWilksPsyD Listening to jargon feels like a slog.
@gobienan Always. Kindergarten style.
Tech nerds love jargon. Customers love clarity.  Impress those who matter most.
@authorWclasses Thank you so much for the feature 🙌🏻🙌🏻

@EvergreenMEP 100%
@nicholasjharris Amazing how that lasts, ya know?
@keyurkumbhare Absolutely. Gain trust first, then sell.
First-time solopreneur?  4 simple things to learn:  - Become known for something specific - Build trust prior to selling anything - Deliver 100x value once you ship - Turn customers into affiliates  Do just these things and you'll excel.  Add complexity later.
@RoryTanner @airtable @canva @Kajabi @zapier @hypefury @NotionHQ @outseta Airtable comes with more automation. I might be missing that in notion?
@back2essence Brilliant.
@rogue_travis Heck yeah, Travis. 🔥Keep it going.
@decisionquant also good
How to flex your entrepreneurial muscle:  Stop telling people what you're going to do.  Go do it, and tell people what happened.
@SeriousAboutYT @MultiMalves It’s less about the hours and more about the mindset. It just means spend a little time protecting yourself.
@BoringSaaSGuy Keep it going!
@codebeef_ These are the types of people I’m looking for.
@BootstrapBro I’m glad to hear that. Any recommendations on folks to follow? Just started getting serious on Twitter about 4.5 months ago.
@BootstrapBro I feel like builders don’t actually share much of the behind the scenes failures. Would love to see more.
@kevinbooyens Simply mind boggling.
@guerrist Also a great strategy.

@60thMeridian @MennellaNick @airtable @canva @Kajabi @zapier @hypefury @NotionHQ @outseta Not really. I just keep it very simple. I like to build my own tables and pages that are very rudimentary.
@KristjanZemljic @airtable @canva @Kajabi @zapier @hypefury @NotionHQ @outseta I moved everything to Kajabi. Still Gumroad is the best for anyone starting.
My solopreneur tech stack:  CRM: @airtable Design: @canva  Website: @Kajabi  Automation: @zapier  Email automation: @Kajabi  Social publishing: @hypefury  Project Management: @NotionHQ  Community management: @outseta   Go with what you know and get started faster.

I still get a rush every time someone buys something I created.  Spend a little time today building towards that.  You'll never regret it.
@jspector I'm not sure, to be honest. I'd have to imagine a few thousand folks from LI came to Twitter, but I haven't actively done much to make that happen.  I don't talk about my Twitter account on LI and vice/versa.  I wish I had a better answer.
@colinize Chair lunch dinner.
@alexgarcia_atx Great tweet dude.   More information crammed into this than most threads.

A Twitter audience is a massive asset.  I've added 37,196 followers in just 14 weeks.  Here are the 7 simple things I did:  🧵
@PaulineRiviere @heyblake @thedankoe @tibo_maker @amandanat @Nicolascole77 @heyjoeyjustice Appreciate it, Pauline!
@immichaelh1 More important for entrepreneurs than solopreneurs (IMO) but important nonetheless.
@guerrist Damn, that's a good one.
@Rodney630711 Thanks, Rodney!
@AndraZaharia Love that. Great addition here, Andra.
@mistamor Most sales methodologies (IMO) are created simply as moneymakers.   I still haven't found one as good and honest as Sandler. I'm sure there are many out there that would give it a run for it's money though.
@I_Grow_B2B_Orgs 100%, Jeremy.
@PaulMarner4 Good call. Never works.
@kevinbooyens Yep. Nice adds.
@write_sfc Good call, Spencer.
@CSMikeCardona Definitely. Good one.
@ThePupOfWallSt Love those, Danny.
@mistamor Why not?
Every solopreneur should study:  1. Human psychology 2. Sandler selling 3. Outsourcing 4. Copywriting 5. Community 6. Storytelling 7. Empathy  What else?
@jonbrosio This is 100% true.
@dvassallo I agree with this 100%.  I keep hearing I "won't scale" with low-cost products, but my course business just keeps scaling.  - $79.25 ARPU in 2021.  - $193.80 ARPU in 2022.  Low-cost can unlock a great lifestyle business.
@ChrisSamp1 Publish your thoughts online.
@ThePupOfWallSt I appreciate you! Thanks, Danny. 🍻
@andreszannelli Publishing my thoughts online
The easiest way to improve your life is to improve your network.
@growthcurrency Start earlier.
@vitlyoshin Nope. You don't have enough time. I ignore most requests for advice and just automate the response.
@crossborder Been going on 3 years with this mix. Seems to be working fine.
@harveygrowform I think it depends on what you’re building.   I mostly build information products so this is about right for my business.
@rnplemos Mostly people asking to be on podcasts or do events that aren't really related to my audience.
@thebrandanhall If I took the time to respond to 100% of them, it would be more.  But, I really only respond to serious inquiries.
@thenishantmodi Start publishing content online each day. Focus on one core topic and continue to create. I've been writing daily for 3 years.
@thefrenchmaker DM me and I'll send you my template.
@thefrenchmaker I have a really good "no" template that lets people down in a nice way.
@thenishantmodi Organic content. No ads for me.
@barrettjoneill That's what I'm usually saying no to!
@ImraneSubstack I'm there finally.
@keyurkumbhare True story.
Solopreneurship is 70% marketing, 10% building, and 20% saying no via email.
@Nicolascole77 Nice! Will definitely dive into this. Thanks for sharing. 🙌
@Nicolascole77 If the refund rates are the same and you sell it for 30% more, but ostracize 30% more potential buyers bc of price sensitivity, it's a wash.  You just miss the extra 30% of people spreading word-of-mouth.  My thought is to raise prices on n
@Nicolascole77 @Nicolascole77 I hope you'll give it a read and tell me what ya think. Cheers 🍻
@Nicolascole77 It's a great way to start. I'm not sure I agree it's a bad long-term strategy.  I'll cross $1M in course sales in the next few months &amp; have a refund rate of less than 0.3%  I'm actually writing my newsletter on this next weekend:  "The
@thetomzach I would advise that you spend some time establishing authority in your field first.  There is no right answer to audience size, but you should look for signals from your audience that they want help with something specific.
@sajidCode Not true at all. Lots of great ideas are executed with very little money.
@CopychiefYu Love it!
@scribblykaur I don't know that a specific number matters, but you should establish some authority in your field first.
@yakshitshh Nothing wrong with that.
@jjeremymiller Free. Game.
@Matt_Mastando Correct. Parkinson’s law. It will always take you as long as you give yourself.
Online course launch 101:  - Topic you could talk about unprepared - Presell via landing page first - Focused on one outcome - Timebox 14 to 30 days - Keep it short (45 min.) - Price for impulse buy - Ask for testimonials - Upsell coaching  Start one today. You won't regret it.
@andreasjonssonn Love that comparison.
@_dylancastillo @SPressfield Will check it out, thanks!
@aurasky_ It certainly does, my man.
@ixdninja Keep it going 🔥
@jaxx_sam Huge fan.  I plan on doing this more this year.
Beginners hoard ideas.  Amateurs share their ideas.  Professionals execute their ideas.
@SeanAnthonySays I don’t really watch any specific channel.   I just search for anything I want to accomplish.   There’s always an answer.
@chrisschaum I really just promoted one product last year, The Operating System.   That did about $370k in 5 months (July to Dec)
@theandreboso Thank you my man. I appreciate that.
@smartercreator Less work and hopefully more income by helping more people.
@tomosman I saw the rock sale, Tom! 😂
@daniel_ndukwu Any information. Free.
@dickiebush As are you, my man.
@tomosman Just trying to catch up to guys like you.  Appreciate it brother.
@daniel_ndukwu Wild, right?  Congrats, man!
@ThePupOfWallSt I think I sat next to you in Trig.
@RealBenjizo What a nice compliment, Benjamin. I appreciate it. 🙌
@jessievbreugel Ain't it though?
@Denis__Shatalin This is exactly it. But, we fail to do it so often.  Stop and take notice and you'll sell more of your own.
@keyurkumbhare Yep. Also, just pay attention to why you buy a course. Is it the email sequence? The person? The trust?
How to sell more:  Pay attention to how you buy.
@jordanmykleby Love it! 🔥
@KateBour @Melingiswriting @warikoo Same. Money well spent.
@salesetup Don't tell anyone.
@Leadership_MVP Some do, some don't. Those who do, purchase.  Those who don't, don't.   I'm ok with that.
@EssersJe It's a big part of how I got them.
@MarketingMax @ctwtn @Dmurr68 @davegerhardt @social_savannah @ImSamThompson @TheCoolestCool @VeryGoodCopy @GoodMarketingHQ Much appreciated.   Bring on the LI hatred! :)
@heyblake I'm turning this Tweet into an NFT.
@pheadrick I gotta figure out last touch or first touch!
@heyblake  https://t.co/xPfr6iGX9P
@thefrenchmaker LOL
@oghie_neo Share micro-lessons and learnings that keep people coming back for more.
@keyurkumbhare Exactly. But just don't overcomplicate it in the beginning.
@stnkvcs 😂
My insanely complex, 7-figure marketing strategy.  https://t.co/Ie5ZVQepmz
@NotechAna @amandanat This is awesome. Thanks for sharing, and for highlighting me, Ana. Cheers.
@dennis_geelen @Faizsayyad_21 Awesome. I'll dive in, Dennis. Thanks for sharing, man.
@Faizsayyad_21 100%, Faiz.
@keyurkumbhare That's a damn good tip, Keyur.
Crappy customer experience?  Write it down.  A list of problems is a list of opportunities  Then solve it:  - Better - Faster - Cheaper  Ideas are packed inside of frustration.
@estherelueme Glad you enjoyed it. Thanks, Esther!
@ReprogramCoach Exactly. Makes everything much easier when you nail the problem and solution.
@arvidkahl  https://t.co/rTQKBHTzs4
@BriTheWebGuy I simply produce content that either:  - Gives people an "a-ha" moment - Teaches them something they didn't know - Makes them think about their business differently  I've found this generates inbound questions which I turn into conversations
Don't sell an online course without building credibility.  Instead:  - Figure out who you love spending time with - Talk to them about their challenges - Learn how to solve them - Share what you learn - Repeat  Do this, and you'll build a wonderful reputation.  Then sell.
@ThePupOfWallSt Thank you, my man 🙌
@EvergreenMEP Perfection is procrastination.
@jessievbreugel Thank you so much, Jessie. Cheers, bud.  BTW - took a look at your town in CR. Looks awesome.
@codebeef_ Marketing means getting attention for your business.  Delivery is about fulfilling the promises of your service or product.
@thekevinrod Exactly. You don't need to create a $1B unicorn.  Just take an average idea, promote it well, and deliver on your promises.  Congrats, you have a business.
@thefrenchmaker Haha. Thanks, man. I wish I saw it that way.
Solopreneurship isn't about a great idea.  It's about attracting people and delivering.  average idea + great marketing + quality delivery = a viable business
@blakeaburge Factual, but talked about way too little...  It's always nice to hear we're all struggling as a reminder to keep going.
@KristineG18901 Both. 👀
@NotechAna @jlogic Right. More clear.
@seempaq @tylertringas If you're interested in using it to grow your business, I've grown mine there exclusively from the 160k followers.  Happy to chat you through it if you'd like, Tyler.
@MindsetMagicc Help others for long enough and you'll get it back 1000x.
@michaelkirsten So glad it was helpful, man. Cheers.
@ThePupOfWallSt Yep. Failures are much easier to digest when we learn and shift.
@victor_bigfield Same here.
Behind every successful solopreneur is:  ∙ Ignored content ∙ Crippling self-doubt ∙ Worries about money ∙ Failed side hustle ideas ∙ Failed product launches  I don't care who it is.  Everyone has experienced it.  That's why it's so important to root for each other.
@dickiebush 99% of people focus on the former, while 1% go deep on the latter.  I was literally just having this conversation with my wife. Great share, Dickie.
@joewebber_ @jspector Appreciate that, Joe 🙌
@_areebpasha I sure have.   https://t.co/dcmjzltc0f
@_areebpasha Consulting for any SaaS company.  By the time I had niched down, I was consulting only for early-stage transactional SaaS companies in the healthcare technology vertical.
@_areebpasha Started there. I had enough experience to charge that pricing.
From burned-out exec to happy solopreneur:  2019: Quit my exec job 2019: Began consulting 2019: Rates @ $250/hr 2020: Niched down 2020: Nailed offering 2021: Rates ⬆️ 5x 2021: Built digital product 2021: Built a community 2022: Pacing 1.5M+  Forget 1-year plans. Think longer.
@constructionge3 No, it’s not.   It’s only risky if you approach it by quitting your job.   I’m advocating for a different approach.
@HeyPJB Courses, coaching, community, advising, ticketed events, etc.
@AmeetM I do not. No children by design.
@GeorgeNoble07 Sure feels like it.
@GCJGoncalves Thanks, Gonçalo 🙌
@ThePupOfWallSt Heavily.
@foliofed Oh, shit. I love that.
@ayushtweetshere  https://t.co/DxDbkeZ137
My business plan:   To do what I want, when I want, with whom I want.
@billrice @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush @heyblake Great thread, Bill! Thanks for featuring me with some other excellent folks. Much appreciated 🔥
@DONVESH Agreed.  Even worse is being an expensive employee at a budget-conscious company.  You're a line item that will eventually get cut.
@BuzzRobTaylor Always.
@sreenathpradeep Great work, Sreenath. Keep building bud.
@ThePupOfWallSt Cliche for a reason. Seems like you got it going just in time, Danny.
@IskanderSamatov Agreed. That's what I did.
@keyurkumbhare Use your job as an investment into your solo business.
@CooperKraussKC Great quote 🔥
@MentalWeapons I love that, Max.
The idea that it's risky to build your own business is silly.  Sure, quitting your job with nothing to fall back on is risky.  But building a safety net with your skills &amp; knowledge is the safest thing you can do for yourself &amp; your family.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
@LBacaj Congrats, Louie. The power of the internet, a good group of supporters, a positive mindset, and some action.  Nice work. 🔥
@AdarshNalam @IndieHackers Much appreciated, Adarsh. 🙌
@tapuzed Very little advice is.
Solopreneurs should adopt a portfolio strategy.  4-5 smaller income streams.  This provides much greater flexibility and reduced risk when compared to one big bet.
@RyanJCormier @dan_qpro @NickB2005 @andreasjonssonn @pragyami @Filippopiras93 @ccmarce_writes @Dmurr68 @mrobertsmktg @PeterLorenco @AkvileDeFazio @ChrisWalker171 Appreciate you, Ryan. 🙌
@jessievbreugel Where in CR are you?
@nickneral I feel ya. I spent over a decade in healthcare technology and the doctor's office is still the modern DMV.
@sunilc_ Good stuff here, Sunil.
@matdrewin Yep. Do more of what I like and less of what I don't.
@Denis__Shatalin Love it, Denis. Good goals.
@viraj_vru I feel the same way, Viraj.
@markomlor Thank you, Mark.
@jpmhdg Same. I want to stop doing things I don't like doing.
@simplytrav03 Love that mission, Travis.
@Tommy_Slocum Thank you my man.
I spent 10 years working for entrepreneurs and 2 years being one.   The latter taught me 100x more.
@Denis__Shatalin I've seen people sell email template packages, eBooks, courses, notion boards, collections of high-performing Tweets, etc.
@keyurkumbhare Publish your thoughts daily in anticipation of a future business.
Making $200k/yr selling info products broken down:  - $16.7k per month - Which is ~$540/day - Which is 4 customers @ $135/ea - Which is 285 daily web visitors at 1.4% conversion  None of this is easy.  But it's certainly easier than staring $200k in the face without a plan.
@jaimevelez Appreciate it, my man. 🔥
@andymewborn Appreciate the share, brother. Good stuff!
@aaditsh Excellent stuff. Thank you so much for including me man. 🙏
@GregoryCronie Just customer service, yes.  I'm not sure why Fiverr vs. Upwork. Just found someone helpful there.
@LukeWerkmeister Beautiful! Glad I could help. 🙌
@scribblykaur Nailed it. 🔥
@CSMikeCardona Nah. Much less expensive than my time.
@CoreyWilksPsyD It truly doesn't. KISS.
@MentalWeapons Need to keep this going and create more.
@workonworkoff Haha. Courses can be bloated (just not mine).
I save 15+ hours per month by outsourcing.   I look for low-value, repetitive tasks in my business.   Then:  - Record a Loom video - Store in Notion w/ instructions - Teach someone on Fiverr to help - Reroute all of my customer service emails  Freedom.
@p_aab Thank you! 🤝
@learnwithvidya Yep. Impostor. Happens every day.
@lilmac024 Thank you, my man. 🙌
@samridhijain_19 Thank you so much 🤛
@AmandaMGoetz @dickiebush @OneJKMolina @shl Appreciate your sleepy CBD oil. Keep it coming, Amanda.
@OneJKMolina @dickiebush @shl @AmandaMGoetz Lol. You're too good not to be featured.
@JamesonCamp It's happened to me 6x in 6 days.
You don't need Elon Musk's morning routine.  Go talk to someone a few dollars ahead of you.
@amcrann @aaditsh Just triggering ideas. I track through other apps like BlackMagic, Ilo, Shield.
@jasonleowsg @JalisoCSP Just for the templates.
@Denis__Shatalin Love this, Denis.
@ItsKieranDrew Yep. No need to build a massive billion-dollar company either.  Just find a small problem and execute solving it.
@DPirciu Yep. Ship fast and then iterate.
@daniel_ndukwu Yep. And you can find problems on a much smaller scale and have a wonderful business.
You don't need a flashy new idea to build a business.  Go find:  - Antiquated industries - Slow companies - Poor service  Use technology to do a better job and you'll likely start chipping away.  A much easier lens to view entrepreneurship through.
@vedran_ruzic @AdarshNalam @ericxcn Not a problem. Go Brownies.
@vedran_ruzic @AdarshNalam @ericxcn Yep. Yesterday.
@AdarshNalam @ericxcn That’s awesome man.   Keep working ‘em!
@ericxcn Ideas through writing and shipping. I write daily and ship daily.
Building a Twitter audience is about muscle work.  Build:  - Idea muscles by writing.  - Editing muscles by analyzing.  - Shipping muscles by publishing. - Networking muscles by engaging.  Work your muscles.  Make everything habitual.
@TheCoolestCool Create. Distribute. Repurpose. Distribute again.
Solopreneur distribution:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - HackerNews - Indie Hackers - Facebook Groups - Private Slack/Discord  If you're writing, might as well distribute.  Different customers hang in different channels.
@ErinBalsa I knew you were gonna crush, Erin. So glad to have met you. Keep going!
@CostelloBrennan @typeshare_co @HemingwayApp @hypefury Just made it part of my daily routine on my calendar. It's part of my job now.
@stanbassett Twitter Blue with bookmark folders for $2.99/mo
@jessievbreugel Definitely.  When you create a business strictly for monetary reasons, it never comes off the same way as personal enjoyment.
@desi_founder Nice!
@keyurkumbhare Watching you do it is a lot of fun, Keyur.
@IamRickJoseph Thanks, Richard.
@ImraneSubstack Keep it going, man. 🔥
@htmleverything Most people never start.
5 steps to a one-person business:  1. Talk to people 2. Understand what they need 3. Create content that helps them achieve 4. Service them one-on-one to learn solutions 5. Package those solutions into a product over time  Talk → understand → create → service → productize

@Nicolascole77 👏👏👏👏👏👏  Typeshare is dope, btw. Loving it.
@Tim_Denning Gasoline on that fire, ya know?
@jlogic It sure can. Part of the reason I love it.
@itstravisdavis Love it. Great place to stay organized.
@sgrubb34 Thanks, Scott!
@SamanthaPostman I was a CRO at a fast-growing tech company and I learned a lot about systems and processes.  You can't scale a one-person business without them.
@investingdean Hopefully the matrix idea is helpful.
@LearnInAwe Start by being consistent.  Once you've nailed that, add frequency to the mix.
@typeshare_co @HemingwayApp @hypefury Step 5: Stay consistent  Writing consistently is the most important step of all.  Here's the TL;DR:  • Ideate with topics/structures • Format with tools like Typeshare • Edit with tools like Hemingway • Distribute wit
@typeshare_co @HemingwayApp Step 4: Distribute widely  99% of people waste distribution opportunities.  You've already written something.  Why not share it everywhere that's relevant?  I use @Hypefury to send my content to multiple platforms.  - Twitter -
Step 2: Choose a solid format  Struggling to format your writing?  There are so many tools out there to help.  I am loving @typeshare_co  They have beautiful templates built right in for inspiration.  No better way to get started.  https://t.co/R3sRX9drb8
Step 1: Ideate rapidly  What’s the fastest way to come up with ideas?  Use systems.  I created my own content matrix in Notion.  - Choose a topic - Match it to a style - Write a quick headline - Repeat until you have 10 ideas  Much of writing is about systems.  https://t.co/PCFJEpj7x8
I made $0 online in 2019.  3 years later:  - 100M+ impressions - $1.7M in online income - 4 successful revenue streams  What changed?  I started writing online every day.  Here's my simple 4-step process.  [Short 🧵]

If it's always someone else's fault, it's probably your fault.
@reneefishman You can just head to the link above and scroll down to read issues.
@mike_winnet Saw it. Will shoot you a note back by EOD. Thanks, Mike.
@keyurkumbhare 💯
@nt2subtle Everyday sell someone.
@OliverJones_19 Yep. A skill worth practicing.
@SullyBusiness So many people are afraid of sales.  Just talk to your customers through a lens of truly solving their problems and you're off to a good start.
@jasontanpc Rolling it into a new site at the moment. Thanks!
@ArnaudBelingaCX @_IlirAliu @tibo_maker @CreateGrowRep I agree that it’s helpful. Two notes though:  1. I started when nobody knew me or the company I worked for.   2. I watch a lot of executive leaders struggle to build their following.   95% of the reas
@ArnaudBelingaCX @_IlirAliu @tibo_maker @CreateGrowRep What do you mean by unfair advantage?
Simple solopreneurs win.  1% go from idea to MVP in a day.  99% get stuck:  - Trying to find the coolest domain name - Crowdsourcing opinions from strangers - Running polls to pick the "right" software - Designing a logo before they have anything to sell  Ship. Then complicate.
@NickSloggett @jackbutcher @garrytan @gregisenberg @dvassallo Appreciate that. 💪🏻
@blogstatic @jspector @anthilemoon @arvidkahl @samarowais @ccmarce_writes @Nicolascole77 @jmoserr @theandreboso @PatFlynn @merott @SimonHoiberg @KateBour @ameliasordell Appreciate it!
@thenishantmodi Yep. Don't overcomplicate.
@GraemeCrawley_ Incredibly amazing (and more descriptors)
@workonworkoff Look up the PASTOR model of copywriting. Works wonders.
@dickens_greg Oh, heck yeah. I'd prefer someone tried, learned, and tried again vs. never trying at all.
@Jeffrey_Funk Morning Jeff. Love the way you put that.
@NotechAna SO true, Ana.
A mistake I see solopreneurs making:  Selling products for problems they haven't validated.  - No real problem - No real urgency - No real pain  Remember that pain is an indicator of purchase.  "Nice to have" doesn't sell much.
@DerekSelinger Working out and building businesses have so many great similarities.
@Aniketmlive 4 hours per day, 5 days per week.   Get more done by focusing on things that matter.
I never hustle 24/7.  But I do hustle 4/5.  Solopreneurship is about bursts. Not burnout.
@o0Aditi0o 😂
@pheadrick Tryin'!
@mattsimondesign That's the ticket right there.
@Creator_Coach Haha. Nah.
@workonworkoff I think teaching is the best way to start, yes.
@keyurkumbhare Basically. But even boring value gets skipped.
@ayushtweetshere Nice, Ayush. Great list.
@SachinRamje Yep. But often people need value defined for them.
4 types of content builds a following:  1. This person teaches me 2. This person entertains me 3. This person makes me think 4. This person understands me  That's about it.
@_IlirAliu @NicoBriner @MakadiaHarsh @KarthikS2206 @agazdecki @BoringSaaSGuy Appreciate you!

@BrandonArvay Just studying how people write online. Seeing what works.  I read a few books like Cashvertising that I enjoyed.
@BrandonArvay Thanks, Brandon!
@daniel_ndukwu As is yours!
@daniel_ndukwu Sure. But if you only seek validation rather than being open to the idea you're wrong occasionally, it can be a real trap.  And most people who seek validation can usually find it. Right or wrong.
99% of people wake up with the same goal:   Further validating what they already believe.  Instead, open your mind.  You'll listen more. You'll grow as a person. You'll build a better business.
@RedondoStrand @siddharthm83 Hey Tim 👋

@agazdecki @microacquire I’m getting term sheets left and right.

@Kellen_the_man Same here, my man.
@theAdamUpchurch 100% you will be.  Help people make money or save money and you'll be right there with them.
@CoreyWilksPsyD It's amazing how this will:  - improve your life - build your audience - help your business succeed
@darentsmith You need to know nothing else except that. If you just do that? You'll likely win.
My best advice for succeeding as a solopreneur:  "Lift others to lift yourself."  Almost fail-proof.
@ncb000gt Yeah, that's definitely likely.  I know being a bit more isolated has led to significantly more anxiety on my side.
@ncb000gt I’m sure COVID hasn’t helped but people have been burning out long before COVID.
@NotechAna Extremely well articulated. Thanks for this, Ana.
@Jabuto_Jabuto Have you identified the cause?
@MentalWeapons It's all a balance.
A lot of people I know are burning out.  Hustling in an imaginary competition with peers.  What's the point of winning a game you hate playing?
Solopreneurs goals should start with lifestyle, not money.  Filthy rich and burned out sucks.   Moderately wealthy and free is heaven.
@Jeffrey_Funk Community is important and extremely difficult to get right.
@jumpshipdev It means bringing your fans somewhere outside of social media, where you can control the narrative and there is no algorithm. Such as a community.
@linkedin_king I'll likely write about it here soon.
@ReprogramCoach Exactly. I need to heed my own advice here.
@MentalWeapons Love that graphic, Max.
The future of solopreneurship:  - off-platform - skill stacking - community first - outsource heavy - experiment laden - partnership dependent - focused on time vs. money - daily progress vs. perfection - built with a lifestyle first mindset
@Josh_G_Roth @realAndyPaul @WillAllred117 It's all you, brother. 🙌
@WillAllred117 Extremely cool. This is a great breakdown.
@WillAllred117 Ahh. Misunderstood. I was thinking purely from a dollar per impression perspective.
@WillAllred117 I think it's probably close to half that. I'll do 60M views and it will do around $1M.
@ChrisRocas Publish what you're learning and other people who are 2-3 years behind you will find you extremely valuable.
@GrowBara Thin skin. The #1 dream killer.
@seempaq That video will live forever and probably land you a customer 6 months from now. That's what I love.
@jackhilbrich Yep. It's really about the aggregate total of your thoughts being available.  I get leads and customers from stuff I put out 2 years ago. It's wild.
@CompundLearner We all have quality thoughts each day.   It’s really about systematizing the process of getting them out rather than “I’m about to sit down and try to write”
Most solopreneurs misunderstand content.  It's not about daily virality attempts.  It's about having thousands of your thoughts in the ecosystem at any moment in time.  1000+ pieces working hard on your behalf.  So, publish frequently.   Because you never know what resonates.
@jakobgreenfeld @EdLatimore @alicellemee @stephsmithio Always. Keep up the great work, Jakob.

@stephenpratley True story, Stephen. 🙌
@ajones55555 I never build or create anything without validating that people will actually pay for it first.
@eduardidn1 Gm.
@hq_storage Yep. Couldn't have said it better myself.
@MentalWeapons Definitely. Is better to test than to go all-in, only to discover nobody is interested.
@jasonlk - Transparency about it - Focus on the 20% that matters - Delegate the 80% effectively
@ecomchasedimond Amazing how rates soar when you find a niche and learn it’s inner workings.
@CoreyWilksPsyD Same thing I tell people all of the time.  Start with a service business and move to productize. Love that.
@ChrisRocas Yep. Also, people forget that impostor syndrome means your doing something good.  I've never met a mediocre person with impostor syndrome.
@heyblake The pain and problems are all discovered during the conversations.  Technical pain → historical pain → financial pain → personal pain  Get to personal and win.
How to earn a living online:  - Build trust through high-quality content. - Talk to people about their problems. - Create a simple solution for them. - Make it really easy to buy. - Deliver results.  Simplicity &gt; complexity
@CoreyWilksPsyD @EricJorgenson It's definitely the sandwiches.  This is a thing of beauty. Please never say no to them.  https://t.co/8bpKckgPwH
@nick_lisauskas Everyone feels uncomfortable.  Might I suggest that you start by focusing only on what you want to be known for?  Over time, you can add back in personal things, but in the beginning, people follow for value.
@itstravisdavis A service business like coaching or consulting is easiest.  Then take what you learn, package it into a digital product, and sell that.  And raise your rates on the service side.
@mcgary_ben Absolutely. Just reminding myself!
@dennis_geelen @dvassallo @dickiebush Thanks, Dennis!
@Raicheen_B I absolutely love that, Raicheen.
@CostelloBrennan @ManagingPlaybk Exactly why I blocked almost all politics. Distractions.
@ManagingPlaybk Which side do you mean?
@_shanicesj Yep. But having impostor syndrome at least means you're doing something big.
The knowledge you take for granted could be life-changing for someone else.  You owe it to the world to hit "publish".
@GoLimitless Love this. Thank you 🔥
@OfferMafia That I did not know. Interesting...
@workonworkoff People feel most comfortable when they can pass their bad habits to you.
@SergioRocks Exactly. Or no to your family and loved ones.
@conquergrowth I back this statement 100% ☝🏻
@TheKushagra25 Always. Time is your biggest asset.
Time mangement tip for solopreneurs:  It's better to say no to distractions than be the person everyone likes.
@jspector Exactly, Josh. Create for the "you" from 2-3 years ago.
@pgpreston Everyone. It's such a simple thing to do.  Apparently, it's also simple to skip.
@60thMeridian @ramit  https://t.co/XOMVTRuf1P
@jaxx_sam That's the exact question.   And the more you learn, the more you realize you can do this step-by-step.   By the time you leave your job, you're ready with a proven business.
Tell people you hate your job and nobody bats an eye.  Tell people you're going to become a solopreneur and get a lecture on risk.  Wild.

@Camp4 @girdley I was part of the labor force for 16 years, then became an entrepreneur.  It's not one or the other.
@ale_bizpln Oh amazing! I'm so glad to hear that, Alejandro. Thanks for sharing.
@SullyBusiness @ModernEremite And it's been awesome to watch. It's resonating because people want behind-the-scenes looks.
@theyashjha That's the best way to approach it, Yash.
@ConsultantBig4 That's what I've found. It's been instrumental in growing my network.
@stnkvcs Keep it going, Mantas. 🙌
@atul31gupta No, I don't think so at all.  And it's not "shouting about every small thing you learn".   Like doing anything well, you'll need a strategy and to execute rather well.
@_IlirAliu Thanks so much, Ilir!
@Denis__Shatalin Exactly. Share out loud.
@OfferMafia Smart. It's worth it.
@ModernEremite Learn to write effective copy, then share what you're learning. A small subset of the world will find you interesting.  And that's all that matters...
@CSMikeCardona Same here, Mike. It's only once I started that I learned the power.
If you're learning &amp; growing in private, but not sharing it here?  You're missing an opportunity to find your people.
@jonbrosio Nailed it.  Busy can feel like growth. That's the trick everyone needs to recognize and avoid.
@girdley @andrewglynch That makes sense.   I've always considered myself risk-averse but my definition of risk has changed over time as I surrounded myself with different people.   That shift allowed me to view trying entrepreneurship as less risky than n
@andrewglynch @girdley Now that I wholeheartedly agree with 🙌🏻  Some people just don't have the interest.
@andrewglynch @girdley Sorry, but that still doesn't mean they aren't wired for it.  You're just describing me 5 years ago when I simply wasn't ready.   Turns out I was "wired for it" after all.
@andrewglynch @girdley Not everyone needs to be one, but I don't agree that people "aren't wired" for it.
@girdley I think most people won't become solopreneurs or entrepreneurs.  That, IMO, doesn't mean they aren't wired for it.  I think it all depends on whether or not they end up in an environment that helps them think differently and discover more options
@BriTheWebGuy Way less.
Solopreneurship is hard. Shitty jobs are harder.
@codebeef_ Different for everyone.  For me, it's about creating more systems, building new products, and generating high-quality content.
@geoff_byron @alexwestco OKRs for the most part.  If something doesn't tie directly to my OKRs, I'm getting pretty good at ignoring it.
@Kyle_Byers @jmcmillen89 - Building systems. - Building new information products. - Creating high-quality evergreen content.
@DuaneDufault @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier @Kajabi @HubSpot I'm moving to Kajabi right now.
@jmcmillen89 This Tweet was a perfect example of me writing at myself.   I feel you. 2020 was my struggle year of being unfocused. Got a little better in 2021.
@dovhyi How true that is...
@nickneral Thank you, Nick!
@TheJonMartin Beautiful. Thank you!
@dickiebush Create great questions, then create a question "stack" to push tough decisions through. Love this, Dickie.
@vaisakh_kris Thank you, Vaisakh!
@mehaines99 @JustlnSaaS Thank you, Mark.
@liamseys @heychazza @JustlnSaaS Thank you. I appreciate it, Liam.
@alexwestco Yep.  Shiny object syndrome is my kryptonite.
@ManagingPlaybk Yep.   - Goals - Check-in points - Tactical action steps
@juliemichellemo Step back and look at what truly moves the needle.  Often, we already know stuff we waste time on that feels like productivity. It's just about asking ourselves the right questions and then having the discipline to stick to the big movers
@kylegawley Makes sense. Feels like sharing a lot of that could be a great way to market in combination with outsourcing.  Best of luck, Kyle!
Most solopreneurs would grow faster if they only focused on the 20% of plays that move the needle.
@kylegawley Outsourcing something doesn't really mean you're not a solopreneuer (and labels don't really matter anyways).   Curious as to why marketing?
@Josh_G_Roth @NickB2005 @CooperKraussKC  https://t.co/x5lQpgnE1g
@timureli @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier Slack
@vikrantpelia Hell Yeah or No.
@vikrantpelia He's one of my absolute favorite authors.
Reminder to all solopreneurs:  Something very obvious to you is worth a lot of money to someone else.  Have a great Sunday.
@theDanKelly @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier Just for analytics for my different websites, and tying it into Gumroad clicks.
@sandeepINVST @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier Notion boards!
@aurasky_ @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier I use Notion to organize everything.  I find inspiration through @hypefury , @TwemexApp , and bookmarking on Twitter.
@usefathom @carrd @ConvertKit @gumroad @outseta @zapier Thank you so much! Keep rockin'
@MrASullivan @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier No, for that, it's @Ghost, but all of my products are on @Carrd websites.
@SullyBusiness @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier @loom Love Loom. Use it for my instructional videos and my process docs.
@thagemeister @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier I use it as a CRM for my advising business. I love the automation.
@_ayushjangra_ @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier @TweetHunterIO @webflow @Razorpay @stripe @airtable Nice, love that. Webflow is excellent.
@AngeZanetti @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier @FlurlyApp I use both Stripe and AirTable and just forgot them 🤦‍♂️
@CSMikeCardona @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier I actually use AirTable. I totally forgot it on this list.  It's the CRM for my advising business. One of my faves.

@Natalie_Furn @LinkedIn @Twitter @arvidkahl @thisiskp_ Thanks, Natalie! 🙌
@PaulElijas Mostly low-cost sales.  Overall ARPU (average revenue per user) is about $77.   Last 4 months, ARPU has been $116 though.
@mcgillmd921 Yep. You can just check their website for guides, help, and instructions.
@mike_winnet Would love to. Let's grab a time in DM.
@mcgillmd921 Same. Gumroad is all-in-one.
@KineticBear @amandanat @CSMikeCardona @oluadedej @dan_copy @andreasjonssonn @ChrisWalker171 I already do this with Hypefury, but it requires manual editing of content.
@mcgillmd921 Thanks, Michael!
@jennykaypollock @sankalpdomore @dvassallo Find 3-5 people in your industry/market who have a ton of followers and play underneath their content. You can grow just doing that.
@jennykaypollock @ale_bizpln Honestly it’s the simple:  Choose a specific topic Learn effective copywriting Write about it daily  I never play for the algorithm. I just assume good content bubbles up.
@MarkModesti @stevemarkperry I'm not sure about years of experience to be successful. That's awfully tough to measure, but likely no more or less than the years put in to be successful in most careers.  In terms of hours, I spend about 1-2 hours per day o
@gabe_llewellyn 100%, Gabe. So much lack of clarity around message...kills people's business.
@mahdisaghafii Networking could be a thread highlighting other creators.  Attention could be shining a light on the problem your audience faces.  Revenue could be asking people to purchase your course or service.
@iamvikeshtiwari Basically, Vikesh.
@victor_bigfield Thanks so much, Victor. Appreciate you reading it, man.
@mauro_codes A good example is a thread that highlights other creators.
@dickiebush Excellent thread, Dickie.  A masterclass in writing.
@KristjanZemljic I like Cashvertising for copywriting.  I like  https://t.co/ZVbx6xdGPr for all things marketing.
@vvilltaylor Build the network and get the attention first. I plan on doing that for 12 months here before I ever ask for anything.
@AASipos Multiple short videos and a few downloadable resources made in Gdrive.   Nothing fancy at all. Not even a fancy webcam.
@TheFalanBlake Gave them without asking any questions usually.
@JimCanto @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn I have almost none. $70 per month for  https://t.co/DNeY0WF8u7, 2.9% for Gumroad and $19 a year for Carrd.
@zetareticoli I address the most common questions people ask me.
@AASipos Video lessons. I chose it bc it’s how I like to learn.
@raouf Gumroad for hosting. I just do one off purchases.
@mhmd_azeez Either promotions/sales like Black Friday/Cyber Monday, or product launches.
@MichePriest This is awesome. Nice work. 🙌🏻
@itstravisdavis Here's what I'd recommend:  Use @gumroad. It's easy, affordable, and exactly what you need to get started. I promise.
@LongchainChris I've personally responded to more than 75,000 questions on LinkedIn over the last 2.5 years.
@itstravisdavis No. They have way too many fields to convert well.  I just use Gumroad and pipe people into Teachable using Zapier for a better student experience.
@dennis_geelen LinkedIn organic posting for me.
@ricardorubin77 Thanks, Ricardo!
@FerraroOnAir Talk about the benefits of asking better questions every single day online. Every post.
@The_MMW @ecomchasedimond Thank you, Fiona!
@mmartin_joo I feature the course on my LinkedIn featured section and I do about 120k impressions daily on my content. That just drives consistent purchases.
@hapsize @dvassallo Haha. It's Teachable the hosting platform 😂
@alexgarcia_atx Thanks, dude!
@stevemarkperry $19/yr for the Carrd website, 2.9% for Gumroad, and $70/mo for  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I which I use for testimonials.  I'm sure there are some other small costs in there (Zapier, etc.) but all-in-all, less than $3k.   I don't do any advert
@axforya The honest answer is I've just never spent the time to learn about ads or talk to anyone about them.  I'm not against them, just haven't ever made the time.  I'm sure they are worth looking into. Maybe I will in 2022!
@ale_bizpln Literally just posting stuff about the same topics, people found it organically.
@autotrader87 @noahkagan @GrammarHippy @sweatystartup @ShaanVP @theSamParr @dklineii @alexgarcia_atx Thanks, Bastian!
@mohitpawar Definitely less now.  I work probably 40 hours per week on my business, like most people.   It's just really enjoyable.
@giordano_ Sure. Just wrote every day for 2.5+ years and gained a really big following. That's basically it
@landforce Here’s a good one:   https://t.co/ORT7Y4VqpF  Shit is delicious.
@jmcmillen89 We’re due a chat anyways. Let’s catch up. I’ll DM ya
@ijinal @dvassallo Just used Loom and Google slides. I keep everything simple.
@KPwagner Correct. Course launches and big promotions.  For example, the last big spike you see is a Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale.
@itschriskeith Launches and promotions mostly.  I don't really talk about it on Twitter because I'm just growing here and not focused on making any money.
@jmcmillen89 Visits to my LinkedIn profile which leads to the CTA in my featured section.   1000 profile views per day leads to about 18 sales per day. I don't have it all perfectly set up.   I'm working on analytics this year.
@JRoss96 I do coaching, yes, but try not to do too much.  I don't want to spend a lot of time in meetings.
@AugMaximus I have a few other ideas that I'll test in 2022.  I also advise SaaS companies, angel invest, run a private community, do a little coaching, I'm part of an accelerator, etc. Lots of rev streams.
@IamAndrewEllis Usually between 21-30 days. About 1-2 hours per day
@john_mackonen Consultancy is tougher to scale because you need more time. But you could always build a team of consultants and deliver them into accounts to scale.
@TheAnkurTyagi Jot your wins/losses/learnings down each day. Then share them.  Sharing your story in public as it relates to what you're working on is great marketing.
@Julienleg @theandreboso It is. But that's part of my LinkedIn strategy. I treat it like Twitter.
@StrategyTime21 I started by talking about SaaS sales because that's what I was doing with my life. Over time, I just listened to what my audience most commonly asked for.  Now I talk about social growth and solopreneurship.
@slanoue 2x per day usually. The strategy is to continue entertaining and educating for the most part.
@MichePriest @SeanAnthonySays Yeah, I'm trying my best to stay away from time for money and turn everything into automation.  But I love the idea.
@SachinNeravath This is awesome! I'm going to look into this. Thank you.
@theciaranmarket I appreciate it, Ciaran!
@MemeCodeMoney Haha. I have no idea what this means, but I love it.
@SeanAnthonySays Not sure, to be honest. I like high-upside, low-effort stuff.   My whole focus in scaling lifestyle vs. scaling earnings. Ya know?  Got an idea for me? :)
@Adi_t2021 I don't ever DM. Just create content.
@MichePriest @madsbrodt I write 1.5 hours on Monday and 1 hour per day on other days.
@Balana26409803 Only my own.
@JohnInscoe I talk about the same topic on LinkedIn every single day and generate nearly all my leads through LinkedIn.
@IamAmanKhatri Here's just one example:    https://t.co/fXZRhfzvZi
@edwindijkstra Ga er achteraan!
@Roy_Bntz My one suggestion might be tightening up your social accounts. There's a lot of political stuff and other things there. If you stayed focused on continuously providing useful content around starting a podcast, you'd for sure get more buyers.
@catalinmpit Thank you so much, I appreciate it!
@Roy_Bntz Where are you currently promoting it?
@dvassallo @mistamor Beautiful!
@VicVijayakumar So far, it's off to a hot start. Who knows how it will continue.
@MichePriest @dvassallo I'd love to know unsubs and also learn more about individual and collective behavior on CTAs.   Basically, it would be helpful to understand "superfans" for lack of a better term.
@gumroad @IamAmanKhatri @dvassallo Amazing! Can't wait for that.
@dvassallo I'd love to see a few things:  - More flexible landing page options - Purchase power parity - More robust email analytics  Outside of those things, Gumroad is magnificent.
@vincenthaywood Simple:  LinkedIn for audience Carrd for my landing page Gumroad for eCommerce  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I for testimonials
@mistamor @dvassallo That's why I build landing pages on Carrd.
@jmcmillen89 That's a great question. I don't actually have a "24/7 funnel" in the typical fashion (email automation).  If I were to make an educated guess, I'd say 30% of my sales come from sale events, and the other 70% come from regular visits.
@vincenthaywood It's about 20 videos, all very short, between 3-6 minutes.
@edwindijkstra Without much context, it's hard to say, but you could build in your native language to learn about the process and collect a bunch of feedback.  Then, go global?
@Adi_t2021 LinkedIn.
@ImtiazAli_1 @theandreboso There are lots of people selling on Twitter, but very few on LinkedIn.  It's just more wide open.
@rudolfcicko2 I only market it organically.  I haven't ever spent money (just time) marketing it in any way.  Is that what you were asking?
@SachinNeravath I would love to offer it.  Gumroad doesn't offer it now, which kinda stinks.
@madsbrodt Thank you, Mads!
@marcisdebaas  https://t.co/zcVWLfNPoa
@k_quirapas It had videos and resources.  I don't know much about piracy, nor do I care.
@rajkbnp @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn @Twitter I never mention my course or sell anything here.
@Creator_Coach @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn I don't use anything like that.  I just use Carrd and Gumroad.
@craiginzana The shortest was 60. The longest was 3.5 hours.   The shorter, the better I've learned.
@SainiRahul_ Start sharing experiences in an industry/with a skillset you have knowledge in. See who you attract.
@SunnyConsults 35% to make it worthwhile
@SullyBusiness I keep them short now!
@yosifux I was never interested, honestly. I probably could, I just don't know anything about it, and haven't ever spent the time.  I wish I had a better answer than that.
@TheKushagra25 Focus on one very specific thing and become well known for it.
@SunnyConsults I built a small following on LinkedIn first. Then went to market.  Always build an audience first, IMO.
@SullyBusiness First course was 60% Second was only 35% (too long!) Current is 55%
@ImraneSubstack I just compiled all of the questions I was most commonly asked by people. That's the easiest way.
@theandreboso LinkedIn.  Twitter is very noisy, while LinkedIn is wide open.
@FariqNazir - My daily life - Things I'm asked by other people - Perusing Twitter and other places for inspiration
@eichel_af I have 2 that are currently active:  - One teaches you how to use LinkedIn more meaningfully - The second one teaches you the systems and processes for setting up your first online service and product business
@madciapka LinkedIn and my email list only.
@madsbrodt I wrote for about 8 months before monetizing. I was at 21k followers on LinkedIn. Now I'm around 151k
@FariqNazir Probably the same way.   I guess I don't really know a different way. I think I would have grown on Twitter simultaneously, but that's why I'm here now.
@jkostecki_rei @SullyBusiness My largest affiliate has done 19 sales. In total, I've only sold 8k through affiliates.
@austencam I had 20k followers on LinkedIn when I launched and a few thousand here on Twitter (but inactive).  Each course took about 21 days to build. Maybe 30-90 hours depending on which one.
@Kellen_the_man The very first time I made a sale and hearing student wins (much like your win!)
@jthomas__ My thought is to price it how I would feel most comfortable buying it.  My first course was $50. My second course was $99. My third course is currently $150.  I've found lower prices and larger quantities of students means more word-of-mouth.
@springertimo I don't think there's a "right" answer to that question.  I built my first course after receiving the same questions over and over again in my DM inbox.  To me, it's more about signals than sheer numbers.
@_IlirAliu @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn No, that's built on @Ghost
@Kyle_Byers @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn Yes.  LinkedIn followed by my email list.
@austencam I started with a $50 short video course that packed a punch. It was affordable so 1,500 people bought it, got a 100x return, and I built a ton of trust.
@ItsKieranDrew Thanks so much, Kieran.
Note: Compounding is real and it shows.  Special thanks to:  - @Carrd for landing pages - @Gumroad for eCommerce - @LinkedIn for massive distribution
After 22 months, I crossed $500k in course sales.  - 12 months to make the first $100k - 10 months to make another $400k  All without running a single advertisement.  Ask me anything.   There's plenty I don't know, but I can give you my perspective 👇  https://t.co/ydMjdP7Lpd
@JAPozueloM Same here. Basically writing "at myself." 😂
@DiegoPinedaVL Wow, I love this. Thanks for sharing this quote, Diego.
@ThePupOfWallSt @JamesClear I've always loved this, Danny.
@ADobrzhansky @dylangallagher I think you learn the best lessons when you don’t avoid them tbh.
Solopreneurship is about managing emotions.  - Don't get amped by $5k days. - Don't get depressed by $0 days.  Slow and steady, 1% better each day.
@Shawn__Graham @ecomchasedimond Glad you enjoyed it, Shawn.  Glad to see you on here as well. Cheers.
@jumpshipdev What an awesome compliment. Thank you 💪
@DustinRoman Thank you, my man. I appreciate that.
@MentalWeapons  https://t.co/zsvUqCwbUp
@Ali_Merchant Appreciate you, Ali 💪
Solopreneurship is hard.  - Block shitty people - Ignore habitual nitpickers - Don't aim to be liked by everyone  Find your people, support one another, and press go.
@ecomchasedimond Thanks so much for the great conversation, Chase. Cheers bud.
@sladeerickson Be a sponge, and then apply a lot of what you learn. Figure out the intersection between advice you've received and what works for your situation.
@JesseGerniginAC Extremely misleading.
@brandonkindred To me, it's about pushing the ball forward an inch each day.
@_serajuddin Learn to learn, and you'll be much better off.
The less predictable your career, the less helpful "how-to" advice is.   Becoming a doctor has a pretty straight-line path.  Becoming a solopreneur doesn't.  Don't blindly follow someone else's advice only to find out their luck isn't on your side.
@apetechda Appreciate it, Alex.
@agazdecki @microacquire "Gazdecki-style!" - Russ
@ReprogramCoach Secret weapon for sure, Jim.
Solopreneur sales tip:  When pitching your product, turn data into stories first.  Stories hook.  Data supports.
@CreateGrowRep @ShreyaPattar @jrryjs @RanaMishka @khushbooverma_ @VaibhavSisinty @nikigupta123 @NickB2005 @Dmurr68 Great stuff, Mayur. Thanks for including me here. Cheers.
@BrianSexton13 I think MBAs are great. I'm sure there are numerous benefits I'm unaware of.  I think most are likely overpriced. $150k payment when you could get paid $150k to wear 10 hats at a great startup company.  Just my 2 cents. I'm wrong a lot.
@cyprianfrancis Congrats!
@jessievbreugel I just saw you're in Costa Rica. What part, Jessie?
@antlerwaffle  https://t.co/wygUCpv0go
@bmceuen  https://t.co/noa3coMqc4
@bmceuen Not too shabby of an idea.  Kellogg School was always my dream. I just wasn't theirs. 😂
@rparnow I'm sure the MBA experience is a great one. I've worked with MBA folks who come in a do great work.  I've also worked with MBA guys who come in with that "I've got an MBA" attitude.  I'm sure you've seen both too.
@mistamor @Nick_Franklin I did. It was manual. This looks really cool.
@mcgillmd921 @dickiebush @arvidkahl @RobbieCrab @anthilemoon @jackbutcher @rosiesherry Thanks for the shout man. Much appreciated. 💪🏻
@scott_bair @agazdecki Thank you, Scott. I love Andrew’s content.
@harrydry Amazing. Congrats, Harry!
@kaleighf I launched a digital course and community business that's pacing 7-figures. Happy to chat.
@Creator_Coach It's actually really, really good. I rewatched it the other day and enjoyed it even more the second time.
@_serajuddin That's the kicker in all of this...
@ayushtweetshere Great tweet. You nailed it.
Solopreneurs don't need viral content.  Marketing is about getting on base every day.  - Familiar name - Familiar face - Familiar topic - Familiar content  It's cliche as hell but play Moneyball.
@AmasCreates I assume at least a mild level of competence when I write.
@juliemichellemo Always. FITI  F: feedback I: iterate T: testimonials I: increase price
@DevLinguistic Sure sounds like it.
@oriolmogas I'm sure there are skills you've developed at your job that you could lean on with the same formula.
Side hustles come before solopreneurship.  Here's an easy way to start your first one:  1. Take whatever thing you do at your work 2. Talk about that thing every day online 3. Find people who need that thing 4. Do that thing for them too  Congrats. You have a side hustle.
@Matthew_Fenton Exactly. When I feel worried, I remember this specifically.
@Andyyk0 I think it's the best way to start. No pressure, and plenty of time to experiment for 30-60 minutes per day.
@abhishekshah173 I feel like it's about building deeper relationships with the right people. Just my take though.
@miloshjokic 100% agree. That’s why I took it in the first place.
@madsbrodt Amen. I hear that.
@noahedelman2 Great point.
@ChrisSamp1 I think so too. Plus, I’ve made so many valuable connections.
@heychazza Exactly. What are the chances you can’t find a job in a few months? Probably slim.
Something I ask myself every day:  "What if I fail as a solopreneur?"  The worst outcome is I go back to work. The best outcome is the exact life I want to design.  Decent downside. Massive upside.   Remind yourself of your optionality daily.
@thenocodepro Here's a great read. I trained underneath the guy who is featured in this article (GuruGanesha Khalsa).   https://t.co/T0fzAS4sO5
@thenocodepro I mean that prospects are unlikely to act unless you can move them from thinking about the pain/problem as a nuisance to more of a "must fix now".   You do this through amplification.  Technical → Monetary → Personal
@joe_portsmouth Excellent recap and you nailed it. Focus is where it's at.
@GrowBara Great question.   I think “everyone else” can be misleading. We exist in a vacuum on Twitter and most of us follow the same folks.   The customers you acquire will likely find your message refreshing vs. boring bc they don’t know “everyone else”
@ImtiazAli_1 1. It’s important to understand exactly who you help, why you help them, what you help them do, and what your differentiator is from other people.  2. I haven’t written much about that, no.
@Kendall_Bachman Just diversification. Who knows how platforms will change over time.  Plus, I really love Twitter. It's great for networking with smart people.
@jthomas__ Really appreciate it, Jake. Good luck out there 🙌
@jthomas__ Really appreciate it, Jake. Good luck out there 🙌
@SergioRocks Exactly. Then learn about why they did that, adjust as needed. Repeat.  BTW - just booked a trip to Lisbon. You live there?
@theyashjha Thanks so much, Yash. Cheers.
@FoundersAtelier Absolutely. Thanks so much for reading it.
@BenjaminPutano Of course, thanks, Ben!
@_grumpypancake_ Sure thing. Thanks for reading.
@copyforcreators Certainly! And thank you for the kind compliment.
@yosifux I think you can't do anything well unless you truly understand your customer. So #1
@brandonkpbailey Thanks so much, Brandon.
I'm here to make your solopreneur journey easier.  That's why I write on Twitter.  If this was helpful, feel free to give me a follow → @JustinSaaS  If you have any questions, ask away. I'm happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading 👍🏻
Starting your solopreneur journey is a lot like building an MVP.  Resist the urge to get complex, and start simple.  Summary:  1. Get specific 2. Network small. 3. Infotainment wins. 4. Simple distribution to start. 5. Let your audience inform products.
5/ They monetize at the right time  You can't come out of the gate slinging product.  Money-making solopreneurs:  - Look for signals from their audience  - Often start with a service business to learn more - Use feedback to inform future product  Are you guessing or listening?
4/ They have focused distribution  You can build a great product, but distribution is King.  Smart solopreneurs:  - Don't play on every social channel when they start - Pick one that works &amp; learn the nuances - Double down on what resonates  Are you analyzing your content?
3/ They understand infotainment  On Twitter, we all want to be informed or entertained.  So, great solopreneurs:  - Teach people something they can apply immediately - Entertain them with other relevant stories - Make their audience think  Ask yourself: Does my content do this?
2/ They build a small but relevant network online  The best builders know it's better to build with others.  So they:  - Network with 3-5 impressive people in their space - Start regular, meaningful conversations - Think quality &gt; quantity  Are you networking or spraying?
1/ They nail their ideal customer persona  Part of building a one-person business is being crystal clear.  Focused solopreneurs:  - Move from Market  → sub-market → micro-market - Know exactly who they are talking to - Deeply understand their customer  Do you?
Why do some solopreneurs succeed while others fail?  I think I've figured it out.  THREAD: The 5 fundamentals of a one-person business:
@BenjaminPutano Tying the pain or problem to 3 things, in increasing order of importance:  - technical pain: generally how prospects describe pain  - monetary pain: turning technical pain into tangible dollars   - personal pain: tying personal goals, mile
@bruce_lambert Nearly all ads you watch, landing pages you view, and copy you read amplify the prospect's pain.   Here's one of the most powerful commercials that does it well:  https://t.co/kS8kJoPMoz
@intlsosa Thanks, my man.
@DenisJeliazkov It's certainly tough. Great books out there like Building a Storybrand by Donald Miller are really helpful.
@HambyDavid Talk to them constantly. Listen with open ears and be open to the fact you don't understand them at all.
@AuthorOnTheSide Understanding your customers. Nothing else works if you don't.
@juliemichellemo Always. They are the hero of the story.
6 marketing skills every solopreneur needs:  - Understanding your ideal customer's pain - Amplifying that pain until it's existential - Telling incredible customer stories - Sharing their transformations - Crafting the perfect offer - Asking people to buy
@OmarMKhateeb Ha. I'll take that.
@thecorsta True story.
If you're a solopreneur, remember:  - Ideas are easy. - Execution is hard. - Consistency is harder.  Start and don't stop.
@ImtiazAli_1 I just mean it's best to build an audience before you build a product or service to sell.  Don't try to build one after.
@MemeCodeMoney YES. Exactly. 🔥
@AmandaMGoetz Did Mexico City on my own and it was pure magic.
@caan_al Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate it, Al!
@neurosys_zero Thanks, Mark. I talk to at least one person each day who wants to sell their product but has never even considered how to distribute it.   So they hit social media and start selling right away.  Crickets.
@thegoldsuite Exactly. If you have a community of interested people, selling becomes significantly easier.
Don't build a product, then distribution.  Build distribution in anticipation of a future product.
@AClaybight Awesome thread. Thanks for featuring me here, Alexander. Helps me think through how to continue my Twitter strategy. Appreciate it! 🙌
@optimalcoco Thank you so much!
@jimmyslagl Get started and simply share your wins/losses. That's the easiest.
@toomaime Definitely.  The motivation part often comes from those rooting you on in your public journey, though.
@jo5e_neto Love it. Even more glorious are the small wins.
@Creator_Coach The accountability part is the magic. Easier to actually do things when you announce your intentions.
@OmarMKhateeb Exactly. And they attract champions on their journey.
@darentsmith And your network grows leaps and bounds, fast.
Build in public as a solopreneur.  Worst case?  You fail and have an insane digital resume.
@TheFalanBlake I get about 10 per day. I ignore them because I don't have time to be a job placement agency for thousands of people I don't know.
@Jeffrey_Funk Correct.  My best advice would be to narrow your focus. I'm sure that within your scattering there is an ideal customer profile that you enjoy working with and can serve extremely well.
@Jeffrey_Funk Thanks so much, Jeff.  Just means it looks clean on mobile. I test it out using a test account to make sure it's easy to read.
@heyNaitik Amazing. Congrats!
@Alec_Coughlin BTW - grabbing coffee with Sloane this upcoming week. Thanks for the intro, Alec.
Happy Sunday to entrepreneurs collaborating with people they've never met IRL.
@Brennen_Smith_ Yes. 9,009. I attached a photo above to show the trend.
@joshuagowolabi Thanks, Joshua. Turns out it's more about the writer and less about the platform, ya know?
@mehaines99 Much appreciated, Mark. 👏
@kouters Keep formatting really tight for mobile.  30% improvement when I do.
@ManagingPlaybk Thank you 🙌
@Kellen_the_man Super kind compliment, my man. Appreciate it!
90 days ago I started writing daily here.  My goal: To share tips on solopreneurship with others.  The results:  - Tweets: 184 - Followers: +24,510 - Impressions: +6.8M - Profile visits: +18,042  Great experience.  If you were one of the folks who read anything I wrote, thanks!  https://t.co/QhydyjchcV
Happy Saturday to entrepreneurs bouncing back from a failure.
@jtunes1978 @spensermwarren @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush @SahilBloom @craigclemens @david_perell @hey_bernie @sweatystartup @jessievbreugel @DanesaGlez @Codie_Sanchez @RobbieCrab @pheadrick @araskin My 10-year old self loves this compliment. Thanks, man.
@aseemthakar_ @_IlirAliu I have equity in my home and lots in former startups.   I’m not building a company that grants me the ability to sell at a multiple for a long term gain.
@ClimbRideRunner Can’t all business advice basically be translated to life advice?
@Matthew_Fenton Great addition. Really smart question.
@alf_poor Thanks, Alf!
@BahWad Love that quote.
@BenjaminPutano @jasonlk I lived in LA. I miss the weather. I miss the different neighborhoods and culture.   I really miss the food. Anyone who says Nashville has a good food scene is out of their mind.
@_IlirAliu The course took 30 days to build and is on track to do 6-figures this January, yes. Will likely slow down over the year.
@mikaelfyi Love that. Great questions.
@aurasky_ Thanks, my man 🙌
@_IlirAliu Using this lens.  Most of my businesses are low-effort/high-short term/low long-term.  For example: I'll do 6-figures in digital courses. Took 30 days to build.  I'll do 6-figures in advising at a high hourly rate.  But, I have zero long-term p
@jasonlk We left 18 months ago.  2x bigger house, half the mortgage, and 10% of our income back.  Still? We miss it a lot. Might come back.
Solopreneurship is about priorities.  Every time you have an idea, ask yourself:  - Does this fit into the life I'm building? - Do I really want this responsibility? - Will I be happy in 6 months?  If the answer is no to any, skip it.  Push all decisions through this lens first.
Happy Friday to everyone using the internet to fire themselves from their job.
@djchrisanthony Behind sharing a lot of efficiencies there is plenty of workaholism and burnout that needs to be addressed in 2022.   I promise it’s not all roses 🌹
@Adhiguna_AIaaS LinkedIn. It’s been good to me.
@CPASuperHero More people seeing my writing and becoming interested. Those people sharing with more people.  And so on...
@sleeplessyogi This is just LinkedIn, where I started writing in 2019. So it's an apples to apples.  I only started consistently tweeting on October 11th. Before that, a smattering.  About to hit 90 days in a row here. Looking fwd to seeing how this grows
@joshghent Right back at ya, Josh. Write, analyze, double down.
A writing journey:  2019: 300 pieces of content, 9M impressions 2020: 300 pieces of content, 23M impressions 2021: 300 pieces of content, 38M impressions  It's not about more. It's about how it compounds.  Start today &amp; you'll be thankful soon.
@AdrienneNakohl @jthomas__ Thanks, Adrienne!
@Robzkeet Yep.  I actually meant this as a comparison between entrepreneurship and being an employee but realized I didn't make that distinction clearly.  Either way, I prefer the former.
@fausto_st Finding customers is harder for sure.  The payoff and reduction in risk is worth the effort, IMO.
1,000 customers at $100 a piece sounds way less risky than being a $100k line item at a budget-conscious company.
@GraemeCrawley_ Damn, those are so good. Nice work, Graeme.
Happy Thursday to solopreneurs hitting key MRR milestones.
@dovhyi Love this. 🙌
@SpiritofPines @Kellen_the_man I’ll invest in that.
@aseemthakar_ @miloshjokic Good call. I actually have both of these.
@miloshjokic I honestly just love following and reading great creator content here on Twitter. I wish I had a better answer.
@VolkCulture It could. There's no "right" way to do it.  Grow a meaningful audience and listen to what they need help with.  Build whatever you think is most helpful in solving it.
@ale_bizpln I'd recommend keeping an eye on what @weskao is building (and who is joining) over at @MavenHQ
@VolkCulture A few things:  1. Be efficient at your day job. Most jobs don't truly require 8 hours. Some do.  2. Keep your first side hustle simple. Create a short digital course or eBook once you've built a small, but highly engaged audience. Timebox pro
@write_sfc I haven't personally been a part of it, but I hear great things about what @Nicolascole77 and @dickiebush are doing with Ship30for30. Seems to be everything a community should be.
@noeffortfinance Most 9 to 5 jobs don't actually require 8 hours of work.  Be efficient and you can do both.  Company grinding you out? Everyone's hiring.
@SergioRocks 100%. Zero barrier to entry.
@mattlady Wild times. Will get wilder.
If you’re employed you can still:  - Consult - Freelance - Write eBooks - Create video courses - Run a paid community - Write a paid newsletter - Do cohort-based coaching  The barrier to entry has never been lower.  The potential to replace your salary has never been higher.
@GrowBara Nearly always. The most successful people I know are just plain curious.
Most successful solopreneurs I know are just curious people obsessed with very specific problems.
@MichaelJNovotny Super kind of you, man. Always here to help folks. Cheers!
@MichaelJNovotny Congrats. I remember the feeling well. You got this 💪🏻
@LearnEveryyDay I mean your product or service needs to solve a big enough problem that your customers care about.  Talking about it daily is simply shining a light on the problem and your solution.  Enough so that your prospects say "I have that problem 
@landforce @agazdecki Stop what you’re doing and ship something now.   Article, Tweet, drawing, thought, product, service, webpage. Whatever.   Make it a habit.
@ImraneSubstack It definitely is. Changes your ability to distribute your ideas.
@DevLinguistic Oh 100%. But it’s a must as an entrepreneur.
@iamPeeches Thanks, man. Glad it resonated.
@AlexAdadot Same. I guess folks are going to have to find it outside. A shame.
3 skills every entrepreneur needs:  - Problem-solving - Storytelling - Copywriting  1. Solve a big problem. 2. Make it relatable through a story. 3. Talk about it daily to attract customers.
@jessievbreugel Probably @sweatystartup
@Yannick_Veys @jessievbreugel @alexgarcia_atx @TrungTPhan Thank you, my man! 🙌
Happy Wednesday to solopreneurs with a clear calendar because they learned to say no.
@amandanat @joshgcalderon Sometimes I wonder how desperate for attention people must be to use pregnancy or violence in their content.  Just pick up a book on copywriting for Christ's sake.
@joshgcalderon @amandanat I agree with what Amanda says here, but to me, that's just opportunity.   Of course, I also see a lot of miserable shit on Twitter.  Like, downright gross. It's all about feed curation.
@dickiebush @dickiebush__ @dicklebush Done. Reported all 3. What a mess.
@AlexCharlesGoff Sure thing. Here's an example of my calendar where I have non-negotiable blocks for content creation, meetings, walks, etc.  Then, I have empty calendar space for flexible opportunities such as someone approaching me for a partnership or 
@YehHoChukaHai If you have a good audience for distribution, you can build a microSaaS.   Acquire 500 users at $19 per month and suddenly you have a 6-figure business.  Pop it onto @microacquire and sell it.  Just one simple example.
@heyNaitik Absolutely.  Work in sprints, and work hard.  Then allow creativity and flexibility.
@trevorgodfrey_ That's exactly what it is, and great call on self-awareness. A key skill.
Solopreneurship isn't about time, it's about discipline.  - Big goals - Check-in points - Daily action steps  My calendar is 40% regimented and 60% flexible.  Regimented for consistent achievement. Flexible for new opportunities.
@bruce_v3 Appreciate the kind shout, Bruce!
@katairobi Haha. Thanks, my man. Great compliment to receive.
@elizabutlermd @stephsmithio I already own this, and recommend it highly! Steph is an expert in her craft. Appreciate the share.
Happy Tuesday to everyone increasing their luck by shipping often.
@GeoffTRoberts @SahilBloom Yep. Just chatting with some dev teams.
@mrjoelcarter @SahilBloom Sorry, that wasn't very clear.  I'm focused on taking off one month per year, one week per month, and one day per week.  I usually have a craft beer every night so this should reduce calories drastically.
@54321Bdunn @SahilBloom I added it to the daily action step to take one month per year, one week per month, and one day per week off.   I usually have a craft beer each day so this should be a massive reduction.
@Alec_Coughlin @SahilBloom @sloane927 Much appreciated, Alec.   Hey @sloane927 👋  New to town and still figuring it out.
@SahilBloom Appreciate the framework.   Before I found it, I had 5 objectives and 23 key results.   This helped clean up my thinking.
@heyNaitik @SahilBloom Thanks for this.   I’m nailing down requirements from dev team (outsourced) and then will use that to inform exactly what I need.   First time building a SaaS so drinking from a firehose.   Will likely reach out. Cheers. 🙌🏻
@heyNaitik @SahilBloom This is great. Love it.

Happy Monday to solopreneurs taking small, well-calculated risks.
@heyeaslo Thanks so much for including me here. Much appreciated 🙌🏻
@aseemthakar_ Amazing! Thank you for this.
@aseemthakar_ Reading it right this minute.
@jaylance Mostly just inside of my courses, tbh.    https://t.co/4tJ1SpowfB
@FamousAlan I’m introverted in group settings with people I don’t know.   In a setting around trusted friends, I’m pretty outgoing.
Attention is currency for solopreneurs.  Learn how to get that attention organically online.  If you do, traditional "marketing" becomes a lot easier.
Happy Sunday to everyone building an intentional life through solopreneurship.
@thealexbanks Totally.   The definition of upside can be fluid from person to person.
@justinmooretfam I like high quality, high quantity, high virality via word-of-mouth.  People come out swinging with $1,200 price points and haven't built the trust necessary to drive that conversion.  Mine are impulse buys that deliver 100x.  Just how I 
@justinmooretfam 85% from OS, yes. All products are $150 but I featured discounts throughout the year.
@ssaripal80 My guess is that you likely took upside to mean money.  To me, upside encompasses things like passion, enjoyment, network opportunity, etc.
Every job is hard.  Pick the "hard" with the biggest upside.
@thepennydrop3 Morning. Happy new year. 🙌🏻
Happy Saturday to solopreneurs adding a new revenue stream this year.
@samridhijain_19 DM me your email and I’ll get you taken care of. Sorry about the trouble!
@MarcLittlemore Thanks for your support! Have a wonderful NYE 🙌🏻
