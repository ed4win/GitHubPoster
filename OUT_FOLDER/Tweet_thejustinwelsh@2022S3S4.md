@thejoshuageelen Great thread, man. Congrats on the growth :)
@drernestomd It's one of the best things I've read.
@emmettkaimusic Of course! Keep doing your thing.
@gb1121 So happy, Greg!   Keep it going in 2023, my man.
@petergyang Thanks for the shout, Peter!
@jackbutcher I'm in awe of people who do this well.  I am so bad at it. Would devour a write up, Jack.
@matt_gray_ Great lessons, Matt!
@dickiebush Really bringing the heat EOY Dickie. 🔥
@natolisnuggets He's a very talented writer and this encapsulates how I think about life.
@TheDannyNaz You too, Danny!
@vilkelisv @TheToolsBook It's fabulous, right?
@KateBour @MarshallKarp You're the hands-down winner according to the comments :)  Keep bringing insane value in 2023, Katelyn.
@ItsKieranDrew You too, brother!
@aaditsh Appreciate you reading it, Aadit.
@mattragland @KateBour It's such a good book. 2022 was a weird, wild, and wonderful year.
@drernestomd @TheToolsBook I ordered it and am looking fwd to reading it.
@milanicreative Already ordered :)
@Joseph__Seifert Thanks, Joseph!
@blakeaburge @KateBour She's a phenomenal follow.
@FitFounder @KateBour Read the piece by Marshall if you have time. Probably my favorite.
@jessedanyusufco @jackbutcher Same.
@SahilBloom It was awesome.
@blakeaburge Great timing for the new year.  You should link up with my wife at some point. She talks about finances daily with her audience.
@TheToolsBook That's it for today.  If you enjoyed this, I would be greatly appreciative if you'd:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
11. Stutz  Who: Jonah Hill &amp; @TheToolsBook   This was my favorite documentary of the year.  I enjoyed the transparency and honesty and found Phil Stutz to be a compelling storyteller, teacher, and therapist.   https://t.co/mXWWHsfsjM
10. Life Can Be Pretty Cruel  Who: @sjdelagarde   It's just worth reading.  The key line: we don’t realise how strong we are until we have no choice. We are so much stronger than we think we are. You too.   https://t.co/qldG0h8UoD
9. Freak Pop Novelty  Who: @emmettkaimusic  While the album came out in 2020, it was easily my favorite listen of 2022.  It clocks in at just 7 songs &amp; 28 minutes, but it's a top 10 album of all time for me.  It powered our drive from TN to NY this year.   https://t.co/Qkw4BAkTdK
@nytdavidbrooks 8. How @TrungTPhan grew his Twitter following by 300k  Who: @jakobgreenfeld   Simply an incredible breakdown by Jakob. The time he put into dissecting Trung's growth was a really great read.  Not to be missed.
7. The Second Mountain  Who: @nytdavidbrooks  The Second Mountain was my favorite read this year.   It helped me continue down the path of joy from purpose rather than fleeting moments of happiness.   https://t.co/srBPwmXr1V
@harrymack 6. How To Not Start Over And Over Again  Who: @jackbutcher  This was a Tweet you could have missed, but to me, it packs in an incredible amount of knowledge.  The importance of naming and brand/phrase/idea equity is often missed.
5. Guerilla Bars 25  Who: @harrymack  Harry Mack has long been my favorite creator. A guy who is literally the best in the world at what he does, and always getting better.  I could have picked any of his Omegle bars as well.    https://t.co/MOF8QHbeyc
@MarshallKarp 4. How we turbo-charged our newsletter subscribers  Who: @KateBour   This great thread from Katelyn has been instrumental in growing my newsletter and how I think about growth in 2023.
3. What is the single insight that most changed your life?  Who: @MarshallKarp  This is probably my favorite article I read in 2022.  Marshall is a NYT best-selling author and very good friend of mine here in The Hudson Valley.   I highly recommend it.   https://t.co/VmxvP9Wost
@MillyTamati 2. How The Hustle Sold Their First Ads:  Who: @thesamparr   How to hustle and get creative to sell your first ads. Cool read and even cooler to share with us.
1. Why Communities Will Fail (and how to succeed):  Who: @MillyTamati   Without intentional community design, 9/10 communities will fail.  I agree.
The 11 best things I read, saw, or listened to in 2022:
@mattragland Amazing, Matt.  Short, concise, and filled with actionable tips.  Instant bookmark. Have a great NYE, my friend.

@JulesEvans11 There's definitely burnout.
@BretMagpiong He's an insanely talented sales leader who is now looking to build something of his own.
@foundersuccess You always must have choices, Marcus.
@ryanrush_ Exactly.
@thebillymassie Great quote.
My buddy worked 60 hours a week for 8 years, burned out, and eventually found himself on the brink of mental exhaustion only to get laid off because his company needed to free up a few extra bucks.  Please build leverage in 2023 by laying your foundation for Solopreneurship.
@dickiebush Really nice recap, my man.  2023 is the year we meet up in person. Let's make it happen?
@phmoty Whoops :)
@SahilBloom Thanks. I'm really pumped to send this one.
@blakeaburge Thank you brother. I owe you an email. Will send that today.
@SamanthaPostman That's the best compliment I could receive.
@FitFounder It won't go too deep on that, but let's grab some time to talk about it.  Lots of good tips on making it an awesome launch.  I'll email you later today.
@TheDannyNaz Looking fwd to sending it out, Danny.
@CoachRizwani Appreciate that.
@MatthewBaltzell Appreciate it, Matthew,
@SachinRamje See you there, man!

@heydannymiranda Congrats, man.  You're a GREAT interviewer. Really enjoyed the time, Danny.   Keep going.
@copywithkush Love this breakdown. Thanks, Kushagra!
@cj_legendaring @canva @TwemexApp Very cool!
@nickmiller888 I think it's more than that.  There are a lot of folks Tweeting for years and can't build an audience.  It's consistency, yes. But also your writing/communication skills, analysis, improvement, storytelling, customer understanding, etc.
@YongSooChung You said it better than me :)
@TheDannyNaz Exactly, Danny. Too many people releasing courses with 8 followers.
@nathancolossus That's the right approach, IMO.
@sam_starkman Smart moves, Sam.
@ThorKopala True story.  But audience and distribution is almost always a key part.
Making money is great – but the best solopreneurs realize that money is an outcome of audience and distribution.  Focus on that.   The money will likely come.
@dickiebush I need to unplug badly.  You're a better man than I am 😂

@anthony_astbury Fear + lack of confidence + inability to take action.
@leadtheprdct You have to treat the open market much differently.  Listen to your audience/customers, experiment, analyze, pivot.  Keep building skills, learn to market, etc.   It;s much harder, but worth ir.
If you work a 9 to 5, you have professional skills.  In 2023, try taking those skills to the open market.  Sure, you'll have to make some noise and attract customers, but you'll charge 5x more than what you make at work.
@thedankoe This is brilliant bud. Well constructed.
@matt_gray_ The reading will take 5 minutes, but true mastery will take years. Community is so hard. You've obviously cracked the code, Matt.
@FitFounder Thank you, my friend.
@SteveOnSpeed Thank you, man. Appreciate the love here.
@PranicPhysician For this, a piece of LinkedIn content.   But, I've also used it in email and on LPs.
@thedankoe Thanks, man. You're writing is so good, I'm not sure you need it.
@SahilBloom That's funny. I knew it existed but didn't really start understanding how to work it until about 3 years ago.
@RunTheMoney  https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE
@gregonpurpose For sure. there is no "right" way to be an Entrepreneur.   I make my case daily for why I chose my path, but there are likely hundreds or thousands of alternative paths.
@shrawanrajkc Really effective.
@lamaandesign  https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE
@PathToIkigai Same. I love this little tweak, too.
@WardensWisdom 100%. Gotta paint that picture.
@TheDannyNaz Wow. Haha. Damn - sorry man :)
@blakeaburge Thanks, Blake!
@ModernManHQ Try it out.
@thealexxroy I love frameworks for writing. Makes everything easier.
@sam_starkman Exactly.
@mralabden Just observe what's going on in your life each day.   Do a 10-minute brain dump.  Or scroll your favorite YouTube, Twitter folks for inspiration.
That's it for today.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
TL;DR  - Pain - Agitate - Intrigue - Positive future - Solution
The Results:  - 276,798 impressions - 1,646 engagements - 371 comments  And 700+ new subscribers to my newsletter (nice).
Present Your Solution:  The last step is to introduce our solution into the equation.   In this particular instance, the solution was my newsletter, and my intention was to drive subscribers.   You can see that here:  https://t.co/ZjJPzoRo17
Paint A Positive Future:  Now that we have the audience's attention, I work to paint a picture of what a positive future would look like.  A positive future tied to following the intriguing Creator Funnel.  Here's how I wrote that out:  https://t.co/wYXkBYRoen
Introduce Something Intriguing:  Next, I introduce something intriguing.  I want the audience to think, "Wait, what's that?"  So in this post, I introduce something called the Creator Funnel.  My goal is to get them to lean in with interest to carry them through the content.  https://t.co/G111Treuyt
Agitate The Pain:  Next, we're going to turn the knife. Make it hurt a bit.  This gets under the reader's skin and makes them...well...agitated.  Once someone is agitated, they are much more likely to be open to a solution.  Here's how I went from problem to agitation:  https://t.co/3llQthpa8J
Highlight Something Painful:  The 1st line highlights a painful problem that people in my audience experience:  They feel taken advantage of at work.  This line is intended to do 2 things:  1. Elicit a strong emotional response 2. Get the reader to the next line  https://t.co/9M3780c6JZ
This is my variation of a popular copywriting formula called PAS (problem/agitate/solution).  I add 2 steps to make it PAIPS:  - Problem - Agitate - Intrigue - Positive Future - Solution  I'll break down a piece of my content that had 276k impressions using this format.
Improve your copywriting with this 5-step formula:

@spontaneousbkpk So awesome, Samson. I appreciate all of your kind words. It wasn't me, it was you - you're the one who took the action. So congrats on the first year of your journey.   It's only the beginning, which is the exciting part, man. Cheers!

@dickiebush Build the habit using prompts.  Also, I've been using ChatGPT to help suggest interesting things to write about. Super easy.
@thePhilRivers Yeah, that's probably true.
@ilovemarichelle I don't. I'm not sure anyone does.  So take small ones and fail fast.
@iamjankoch I don't really use any, to be honest. I've been a "gut feel" guy my whole life. No joke.
It feels like 90% of being a Solopreneur is taking small but uncomfortable risks constantly.

@jessedanyusufco @thedankoe Dan is a wonderful business person and all-around great guy. Glad to have my name in there with his.
@gregonpurpose I'm familiar with it but haven't read through it fully.
@SahilBloom Appreciate that, man.
@janekminarik It's not if you understand it.  Many people see it as a risk.
@sam7rs I agree with this.
@lincolnpolson Radical accountability is a term I like.
@JayMacBiz 100%, Jay.
@jeffperez_jr Same here. Only choice.
An upside of Solopreneurship is being owned by nobody.  No investors, no board, no boss, &amp; no banks.  The downside is that if you fail, you're 100% responsible (and many people have spent their lives blaming others for failures)  If you can accept that, you should play the game.
@gabe_llewellyn @FitFounder Not in a million years.
@aidanlyon @thysroes There are lots of one-person businesses:  - Courses - Coaching - Community - Advising/Consulting - Design - Copywriting - UX/UI  Lots and lots.
@thedankoe It's difficult (although not impossible) to analyze &amp; improve most things in your life if you're chained to a paycheck.  Companies are pushing people to the brink, and then your reward is a layoff when the math doesn't work.  I hate that.
@ItsKieranDrew Like most things, hustle gets pulled to the extreme by both sides:   Hustle 24/7 vs. Anti-hustle  The truth is, sometimes you gotta hustle and sometimes you need to rest.  "Everything in moderation." - My Mother
@alexgarcia_atx 4.9B people with an internet connection and most people need 2 clients to leave their job.  I like that math.
@thedankoe Same. Cut my pay by 50%. I don't care. This is the best life.
@thisiskp_ I love watching you get after it, KP. Keep it going in 2023 my friend.
@gregisenberg Thanks for the shout, Greg.  I think 2023 will be the year that top-performers realize the internet provides them with a ton of options.  Solopreneurship will become increasingly more common.
@FitFounder Same. Money is the outcome of working on what I enjoy.
@ItsKieranDrew Same here. Eliminated coaching and advising. Taking no more than 2 meetings per week with people I actually want to talk to.
@SahilBloom Yep. That's it right there.
@SystemSunday Great thread, Ben, and appreciate the shout for the hook :)
@HellloHar Go to Mexico City with 2 of my closest friends.  Walk 15,000+ steps per day.  Have breakfast every Sunday morning with my wife.
@heyeaslo You're crushing it, Easlo. Solopreneurship is the right game for you.
@dennis_geelen Same here.
@donnelly_ceo Same.
@Ethan_Mick Yep. Very challenging. But not as challenging as renting out our time forever.
Solopreneurship isn't about disrupting an industry, building the next unicorn, or being featured on some Forbes list.  It's about doing things you enjoy, with people you enjoy, and doing very little of what you don't like.  Anti-Maximization is the mantra.

@nathanaprice This is definitely true.
@DrGarCla Definitely. It's already helping me.
@jessedanyusufco I hope so, Jesse.
@hesbythesea The best teacher is action, I promise.
@mattvvolf Tryin!
2023 Prediction:  More high performers will view one-person internet businesses as a viable option alternative to traditional work.  More flexibility, high income potential, 100% ownership, &amp; the ability to be present for their partner and children.  We're just getting started.
@okeymangesh @NealOGrady I have not.  I have a few affiliates running ads, which I need to figure out how to disable.
@NealOGrady @FreeSites_com They need to make this into a template.
@NealOGrady The Country of Wales SHOULD! Good call. 😉

@SahilBloom This is so smart. More stuff to add to my routine. Love it.
@jasonstrimpel Thank you, Jason!
@PathToIkigai @SahilBloom He's a smart guy, that Sahil.
@thedankoe Thank you, my man. Appreciate that.
@ant_carlton I still am too at times. But working through it.
@ChrisLaubWrites Yep. If you can't figure that out, it's tough to fix.
@FitFounder It's that momentum on tasks that really changes things.
@SahilBloom Damn, that's funny 😂
@sam_starkman Love that, Sam. Great formula.
That's it for today.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
As you complete your tasks, you move closer to your goals.  As you reach your goals, you become even more rigid in how you spend your time.  When you become rigid about how you spend your time, you stop procrastinating.  Congrats. You've done it.
Use Time-Management Techniques:  Get yourself a Pomodoro Timer.  After being recommended to me multiple times, I finally bought one.  25 minutes of deep task completion followed by a 5-minute break.
Get Organized:  If possible, sit down at a clean desk in a minimal workspace.  Get rid of unnecessary piles of junk, snacks, or messy papers.  Just your computer, the tools you need to complete your tasks, and maybe a cup of coffee or espresso (if you're like me).
Eliminate Distractions:  Put your phone and computer on Do Not Disturb mode.  Get rid of all push notifications while you're at it.  Close all social media tabs.  Shut the door to your office, throw on headphones, and lo-fi beats (or white noise).  This is your Zen time.
Create A Schedule (and Stick To It):  Everyone has times of day when they are more productive than others.   Figure out when you are most creative &amp; schedule your tasks for those times.  Create a recurring invite and include links to the tools you'll use during that block.
Break Down Goals Into Small Tasks:  Big goals can be overwhelming.  Small tasks make things much easier.  For example, getting 100 newsletter subscribers might feel daunting to some people.  But if you can think of a way to attract 4 per day, you'll get there in one month.
Set SMART Goals:  - Specific: What, specifically, do I want to accomplish?  - Measurable: Quantify what success looks like.  - Achievable: Is this reasonable?  - Relevant: Why am I setting this goal?  - Time-bound: What's my time horizon to finish?
Start By Identifying the Root Cause:  There's a reason you're putting things off.  It could be a lack of motivation, no clear goals, no resources, or missing confidence.   You need to start by being honest with yourself so you can figure it out, and address it directly.
How to stop procrastinating (for good):
@thedankoe Just instituted a week-long plan for 2023, starting next Monday.  Really interested to see how it goes for me. Good stuff, Dan.
@chris_gensheer Awesome thread, Chris.  Appreciate the shout, man!

It's amazing how many people unlock generational wealth because they believe in an idea, start working on it, and don't stop.
@SahilBloom Publish, publish, publish. Watch 2023 be a more interesting year.
In 2023, even if you’re employed full-time you can still:  - Consult - Freelance - Write eBooks - Create video courses - Write a paid newsletter - Do cohort-based coaching  The barrier to entry has never been lower.  The potential to replace your salary has never been higher.
@MasculineMind_ Appreciate the mention ❤️
@jackbutcher Happy Holidays, Butcher fam.
Merry Christmas, Twitter.  Thanks for a sliver of your time and attention this year.
@LiebermanAustin Thank you so much, Austin. What a wonderful compliment to receive.  Happy holidays!

@sakkybl @blakeaburge This made me laugh :)
@dickiebush Dude - Notion pages? Love this addition. Jumping into the travel one now. 🔥
@SystemSunday Thank you for the inclusion, my friend.
@blakeaburge I need a Google sheet that stops me from eating hamburgers in 2023.
@_adamno It's short for elliptical.  In college, I used the elliptical each morning (I can't run, have 2 back surgeries) and the machine brand was EFX.  So, I've just always called it that.
@SahilBloom Dominant recap. Immediate bookmark.  Have a great Holiday, Sahil.
@MarkShust @NotionHQ Turns out there is no Carol in HR.
@ygorduraes I'll check it out!
@AuthorOnTheSide I think just getting organized in something (could be Notion or Google Drive or whatever) is critical. Then, have a system for content.  Nail those 2 and you're off to a good start, IMO.
@omgitsinfy Thank you!
@EvanThomson01 Thanks, Evan!
@blakeaburge I've finally gotten good at this. It's taken a decade, dude.
@jasonstrimpel It's the best distro system I've read about,
@SahilBloom I feel the same way, funny enough. I know I can get better.
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Virtual Assistant System:  Last year, I brought on VA to help reduce noise during my weekday.  She was absolutely amazing and saved me nearly 40 hours per month.  (She left Zirtual in 2022 unfortunately - will hire anew in 2023)  Here was our system for working together:
Networking System:  Keeping up with people isn't easy.  Sure, my best friends &amp; I talk weekly.   But I want to touch base (and support) others I've gotten to know. So, I created a quarterly reminder.  Every 13 weeks, I reach out to 20+ people to see if I can help in some way.  https://t.co/XTI0JcOpWA
Content Promotion System:  If you write once, you should promote twice.  Part of my 2023 plan is to install a best-in-class promotion system for my business.  I'm going to start by following this one from @harrydry at MarketingExamples:   https://t.co/YmgFZPq1HS
Content Creation System:  I use a 4-step content creation system to produce rapidly:  - Step 1: Curate - Step 2: Create - Step 3: Templatize - Step 4: Distribute  I use a combination of @TwemexApp + @SaveToNotion + @hypefury to execute on the plan.
Time Blocking System:  GCal + Calendly makes sure I never book something in the wrong spot.  - Mornings: Workout &amp; Engagement on social - Early afternoon: Creativity and writing - Late afternoon: coaching &amp; meetings  I set up custom availability for everything.  https://t.co/zofyOXSapU
Knowledge Management System:  Everything you know or need to reference should be stored in one place.  I use @NotionHQ as my personal knowledge management system:  - Business plan - Weekly to-do - Course roadmap - Business workflow - Process documents  All in one place.  https://t.co/wiQ5qKpZz3
My 7-figure, one-person business is run entirely on systems.  Here are the 6 most important ones I use:  (Feel free to steal, replicate, and use for your business.)

@schlaf Atta boy!   And lots of clients impacted in the most positive way.were
@dickiebush Stack small skills on top of one another. Regardless of whether you are a novice or a pro at any of these, just start becoming 1% at each.
@ishverduzco Yes please.
No matter who you work for, you should act like you work for yourself.  Because nobody will hold you more accountable than you.
@arvidkahl This person seems to be taking an, “everyone else said this was easy and turns out it wasn’t” approach and therefore they are at fault.   Rather than, “here’s what I learned and here is what I might do differently next time” approach  Not tryin
@thedankoe It's amazing how much my "luck" has changed by publishing my core beliefs to anyone who will listen.
@EdLatimore Congrats, Ed!
@thestorystylist Thank you so much
@SahilBloom I started thinking about anti-goals when I came across your piece and Andrew Wilkinson's piece. Had never considered them.
@TheDannyNaz Cheers, Danny!
@shushant_l Amazing, Shushant!
@jasonstrimpel Haha. Thanks, Jason!
@callmehouck Super important and relatively easy.

One of the biggest Twitter hacks I've found is to be a genuinely nice person and root for other people to succeed.   The bar is pretty damn low around here sometimes.
@Victortmanrique Calling myself out.
@Reid_HFC Same.
@verocopyco I got myself.
@tariquesha1 Haha. It's not. But I try and make the explanation simple.
I'm not sure who needs to hear this, but you're probably overcomplicating it.

@jordvandenhooff @SahilBloom I actually pay $15,600 (did my math before coffee).  It could be pre-existing conditions (I have 2 back surgeries + a medical issue) plus my wife, and I opted for a premium insurance product.
@FitFounder Smart man, Dan. That's the phased approach.
@blakeaburge Keep giving it a shot!
@DaveMeier @ItsKieranDrew 100%. It's extremely hard.  But everyone should at least consider it if they have strong confidence and ability.
@theleoalexandru Cool, thank you! I appreciate that.
@matt_gray_ I'll check it out!
@theantonioreza Yep. I chose that word very carefully.
@ant_carlton I think it's a smart move. I think you should replace 60 to 70% of your income and then jump.
@theleoalexandru I write about that all of the time, and agree.
@SeanPHogue That's a good place to be :)
@careyourpresent Build up your business first. Then leave.
@sam_starkman That's great. Work to replace 60%-70% of your salary and then GO.
@SahilBloom I was just talking about this, this morning with my Mother. I pay over $24,000 per year in health insurance. It's ridiculous.
@sweatystartup Smart. With this much competition, it's still the best time because it's only getting more competitive.
@natolisnuggets I had somewhere between 3 to 6 months runway. That was certainly helpful. I also had started before I quit.
@Nicolascole77 I hope so too, man.

Regret:  Don't look back in 10 years and wish you got started earlier.  Could you fail? Absolutely. Will you make mistakes? 100%  Will you recover and always be able to find a job again if you're talented? Definitely.  At least give it a shot in 2023.  I'm rooting for you.
Joy:  We all think we want happiness, but what we really want is joy.  Happiness is fleeting moments. Joy means making an important impact during our lives.  By betting on yourself and aligning with a higher purpose, you give yourself the best shot of living a joyful life.
Purpose:  When you were growing up, did you dream of sitting in a cubicle &amp; talking to customers about some random integrated multi-platform functionality that will probably fail to IPO?  No.  Instead, choose an obsession and go find people who need what you're selling.
Flexibility:  Want to take Johnny on a fishing trip?  Want to accompany your aging parents to Japan for their dream vacation?  No more "Damn, my boss says no" while telling your friends about the great work/life balance at your company.  Say yes to everything that matters.
Leverage:  If you build a successful online business, you create incredible leverage.  You become harder to control. You can say no more. You can take time when you want.  You control the effort and how big you want to go.  You're the decision-maker.
Loyalty:  In case you've missed it, companies are laying folks off at a pretty rapid pace.  Newsflash: You're a line on a spreadsheet until the math doesn't work out.  The days of 30+ year careers at companies are over.  Employ yourself and you'll get the boss you deserve.
Your Time:  Time moved slowly when I was a kid.  A little faster in my 20's. Then?  Bang. I'm 41.  I can't imagine spending the prime of my life missing my wife, not being able to explore the world or see my parents before they are gone.
Your family:  Your spouse/partner is getting older and your kids are growing up fast.  Are you going to be happy that you spent more time at the office, or built a business where you can spend the majority of your time with your loved ones?
Your health:  During the pandemic, many people got significantly less healthy.  Now, we're back at work and also trying to play catch up on our health.  That's not a fun game to play.  Take 12 months and zoom in on your health with more free time.
The Internet:  There has never been a better time to start an internet business.  You have access to 4.9B potential customers.  Break your current earnings into weekly chunks.  Can you find enough people to pay you each week for your knowledge or services?  Likely yes.
Why you should consider quitting your job in 2023:
@matt_gray_ Never gotten into Reddit.  What's your Reddit fave community, Matt?

If your boss can make you cancel your planned vacation, please don't tell me about your work/life balance.
@vdanielpinto When your intentions are bad from the beginning, there is no right way.
@piros_eth Or stop acting.
@jamierusso Badges of honor (figuratively).
For solopreneurs it pays to act fast, make mistakes, and never stop iterating.  Go fast. Be wrong. Fix it. Repeat.
@bruce_lambert Sharing your unique journey rather than regurgitated best practices.
@sgrubb34 @justinwelsh Thank you brother,
@thetomthorley Looks like a damn nice background, Tom. Thanks for the video.
@matt_gray_ Great thoughts, Matt. 💡
@thedankoe Most of the people I know who learn effectively, learn by doing. There is nothing better than playing basketball to learn how to play basketball. But we often take such an opposite approach. Knowledge gathering forever and never taking action.
As a solopreneur, you are the product.  Your success depends on how good you are at selling, networking, and making yourself unforgettable.  Your goal is to authentically express your journey, values and personality and then find an audience that resonates with it.
@chase_arbeiter @dickiebush @matt_gray_ @ItsKieranDrew @thedankoe @SahilBloom @FitFounder Thanks, Chase!
@Nicolascole77 #3 is a ton of fun.  I've been taking cooking classes and wine classes in every country I travel to.
@aaronhayslip True story.
@Nik_Atanackovic I wouldn't say it's a massive differentiator.
Networking 101  When you reach out to busy people, assume you are 1 of 1,000+ people asking for their time.  - Differentiate yourself. - Make your ask mutually beneficial. - Make it really, really easy to say yes.  Do these 3 things and you'll network more productively.

Everyone wants to be successful and wealthy, but nobody wants to get out of their comfort zone.  So, move to that place, start that business, publish that content, and send that cold email.  Where dreaming fails, action usually succeeds.

@dickiebush That little stack of Moleskine notebooks is like pornography to a writer.
@piros_eth Yep. Go out for a 90 minute walk, sans phone.
@hedithewriter Thanks. IT's basically a little self help book without the 200 pages.
@EvanThomson01 I've found it to be for me!
@SahilBloom 100%. I used to feel like each day I had to cram as much as possible into the 24 hours I was given.   Now I cut a lot of meaningless work out, and work in bursts.
@PrivatEquityGuy Not drastically. Too many options to pay 10%+

Take care of your physical and mental health:   Taking care of your physical &amp; mental health is essential for re-wiring the way you think.  Eat a healthy diet, exercise, and prioritize sleep, relaxation, and stress management.  Just doing this alone changes your brain.
Surround yourself with positive influences:   The people you spend time with have a massive impact on your thoughts and behaviors.   Surround yourself with optimistic winners.   People who are supportive and positive, and who will encourage you to reach your full potential.
Learn from your mistakes:   When you make a mistake, don't panic.  It's important to be cognizant of mistakes and try to see them as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than as a failure.   Write your mistake down, analyze it, and look for ways to do better next time.
Practice mindfulness:   Mindfulness is the practice of being present and engaged in the current moment.   This drastically helps reduce stress, improve focus, &amp; increase self-awareness.  Shut your phone off to be with your family.  Put it on do-not-disturb 24/7/365 if you can.
Stay organized:   Organizing your thoughts, tasks, and surroundings can help you stay focused and on track.   Use tools like Notion, calendars, and smart planners to help you stay organized.  Remember to tie organized actions back to your SMART goals from above.
Take breaks:   Taking regular breaks can help recharge and refocus your mind.  This is proven to improve your overall performance and productivity.  I don't know a single great thinker who is on 24/7/365.  Remember - bursts, not burnout.
Practice visualization:   Visualization is a wonderful tool that can help you flip your mind to think more positively and confidently.   Try visualizing yourself achieving your goals and succeeding in different situations.  Paint a picture in your mind of a positive future.
Set clear goals:   Every quarter, create SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals that you can work towards.  These can roll up to your yearly goals for yourself and your business.  This provides a simple roadmap to stay focused and motivated.
How to rewire your brain (to think like a champion):

@JoeydeWit_ So true.
All those questions you have about entrepreneurship get answered when you just start.
@dennis_geelen @AdamMGrant I have not, but I will. Thanks!
@flourish_firm This is awesome. Love it.
@sunglassesface It's my take, as is everything I write.
@theantonioreza Exactly.
@NealOGrady Nah. I live 2 hours outside of NYC!
One of the clearest signs of intelligence is being interested in other people’s perspectives.   95% of people I meet aren’t.   Crazy.
@thedankoe People miss the "for yourself" part. They just curate and aggregate other people's thoughts and then wonder why nobody buys from them.
An observation about solopreneurs on Twitter:  Many struggle to make $1 online because they are focused on how to make $1M online.  Making $1 will change the way you think.  Start small, not grandiose.

@SteveOnSpeed Never buy RTs.   But 100% you should network and build supportive groups of creators.

@optimizium_eth @albadawee Thank you both!
@SahilBloom Nah. You've already got the notes!

TL;DR  Step 1: Write the body using headers and white space Step 2: Use a specific call to action to tell readers what to do. Step 3: Write compelling hook lines by using my recommendations.
Example 4: Get right to the point
Example 3: Compare &amp; Contrast
Example 2: Use eye-catching numbers
Example 1: Tell people what they'll get &amp; address an objection
Lastly, craft a great "hook" Tweet:  The most critically important step in writing Tweet threads is the "Hook" Tweet.  This is the first Tweet in your thread, and it makes or breaks your entire thread.  I've found there are 4 ways to open a killer Thread.  Here they are ↓
Add a great CTA:  People write threads &amp; then forget to tell the reader what to do at the end.  Here are some example CTA's:  - Follow you - Buy your product - Join your newsletter - Retweet the first Tweet - Read another thread you wrote  Check out this one from me:  https://t.co/FAcm79LXX5
Use headers and white space:  A header simply tells the reader what to expect in each Tweet they are reading.  White space is the space between lines so that it's easier on the eyes.  Don't use too much whitespace, but just enough to make it easy.  Here's an example of both:  https://t.co/THRrxPJOPl
Start by writing the body:  The body of the thread is the information you're attempting to convey.  It should add very specific value:  - Teach something step-by-step - Tell an interesting story - Share a framework - Dispel a myth  Stay away from nebulous observations.
Here's what you'll learn by reading this:  1. Starting with a great thread body 2. Using headers and white space 3. Writing a direct call-to-action 4. 4 killer thread openers  Let's dive in ↓

@saastrash There are always outliers for sure.  I just wouldn't depend on being one.
@dew2kris Thousands, likely.
@maljunkul An online audience is one distribution channel, sure. There are others too.
@roalho Correct, but you still need attention, and that's the hardest part.
@PathToIkigai Damn. That's a good Tweet.  I forgot about that one 😂
@NealOGrady Neal - moving to CK this week. Let's revisit your email to me about newsletter stuff soon.
@TheCoolestCool Become your own PR firm. Shout it from the rooftops!
Building a product is important, but building distribution first is crucial.  Lots of people build things, but very few get them into the hands of the right people.
@dickiebush Wow. This looks awesome. Congrats on putting it together fellas :)
@SahilBloom Great process.  How do you package up your learnings and create a plan to take action?   Is it just little micro-moves or do you create a full-scale plan?
@Samfarber_ That's knowledge, not wisdom.
@JarvisKa I don't use it, so I'm not sure.
@danielcberk Haha. It's just what I do each week, written in a simple format.  No hacks, no tricks.
@DrewKMedia It's not a great newsletter tool, honestly. It's just what I know how to use.  Try @ConvertKit  or @beehiiv
@dickiebush Since moving to a new city, I've been doing this thing where I try and repeat the person's name to them 2-3 times the first time I meet them.  Then, I address them by name each time I see them moving forward.  I used to suck at names. Now I'm

@SahilBloom You can. You've already got 2 newsletters, just write a 3rd, you machine. 😉
@matt_gray_ Thanks, brother!
@DrewKMedia I use Kajabi, but have found that using what you know how to use keep friction low.
@alan_cheng I haven't. I think most of that advice discounts how many people you turn off.
@SachinRamje 1. I think so. Show your true authority and expertise rather than crowdsourcing others.  2. I think you can choose little niche topics underneath the umbrella of a larger topic.
@SystemSunday Dude - Idea is the toughest...Sometimes that takes 10-15 minutes by itself and delays me process.

Edit using a system:  Here's mine:  - Are your sentences concise and understandable? - Do you have any long, ongoing tangents? - Do you deliver what is promised in the headline? - Did you add links to relevant resources?
Write the title:  With the first newsletter draft written, it's much easier to choose a title.  Use a subject line tester to see how "good" or "bad" your title is.  Work it until you're sure you'll have decent open rates.
Add images, video, and research:  Once you have the body, you can add supporting multimedia.  Find your Tweet/Book/Quote from above and insert it.  If you need an image or video to help explain something, now is the time to put it in place.
Fill out the body:  Now you can fill the information in to support each header.  Use this framework:  - Start with an opening line that explains the header. - A paragraph about what you learned about the header. - A paragraph about how to put learnings into action.
Write the headers:  Before I write anything else, I write the headers.  This basically gives me an outline to follow and makes it much easier to write.  Once you have the headers, you have a little treasure map to follow.
Use a template:  This is where most of my speed comes from.  I use a newsletter template so that I can generally follow the same process each week.  - What's a big problem? - How do most people solve it? - Why doesn't it work for them? - How would I solve it differently?
Gather information:  Once you've chosen your topic, then do some research to back up your thoughts.  I like to Google and look for:  - One book - One Tweet - One quote - One article  Then, choose 1 or 2 and use them inside of your issue.
Chose an idea:  If you want to go faster, you should always be building an idea bank.  Take 15 minutes per day and look at:  - YouTube channels - Aggregator newsletters - Relevant news stories - Things you've learned  Jot them down and keep a running list.

@writes_eve @SlamingDev @ItsKieranDrew That's a darn good start, Eve.  I hope you keep going because it really does compound over time.
If I had to start my solopreneur journey over, here's what I'd do:  - Pick a skill I know cold - Talk about it daily online - Offer to help 3 companies free - Track meaningful improvements - Get a few testimonials for my website - Ask for intros to other companies &amp; charge $$$
Every job comes with risk, but only solopreneurship comes with autonomy.
@dickiebush Got myself the same Nespresso machine. Love it. ☕️
@FitFounder Nailed it.  I knew employment wasn't for me when I had to cancel a trip to Thailand that I had been planning for 3 months.
@MattU_FP I do 99% on my own.   I have a part-time VA that works about 20 hours per month on customer service.
@ItsKieranDrew The funny part is both come with risk, and only one comes with autonomy.
@jurijtokarski In the end, no boss at work cares about you when it comes down to them or you.   So might as well be your own boss.
@talktoterryco Correct.  Purse curiosities and live with purpose.
@PathToIkigai I love that, Leo.
@BrianFeroldi I think so too, Brian.
@jasonstrimpel Same here. It's fun to get paid to be creative, but also have almost total flexibility.
@SahilBloom Sahil the HS philosopher. I dig it :)
@matt_gray_ I've also been using the headline analyzer. Really interesting feedback. Hypefury is obviously my jam.
@thedankoe I haven't worked 8 hours straight since I left my job in August of 2019 and I'd argue my productivity has tripled.
The greatest benefit of being a solopreneur is not making money.  It's having the power to orchestrate the life you imagine with no one's permission needed.
@dklineii @MavenHQ @ChristianWattig @APompliano Congrats man!
@brianondrako @dickiebush Thank you 🙌
@AlanJLSmith @dickiebush Appreciate it!
@jmfcoaching @dickiebush Thanks! 🔥
Betting on yourself is an act of confidence.  Fighting the status quo takes guts.  Being willing to fail takes bravery.  Here's to all of the Solopreneurs out there who don't get the accolades of unicorn-entrepreneurs but go through a lot of the same shit.

@jayclouse I love that, Jay. Great name for it.
@SahilBloom Yikes. I read daily as a child. Is that 14%? goodness.
@thedankoe Distribution gives you incredible leverage and optionality. That's why top-of-funnel will always be so critical.
@FitFounder Working on this right now. Nutrition is my killer. Love hamburgers and fries too much. Time to get this dialed in.
@SystemSunday I've been slowly minimizing for years. I found that going "all in" was really tough for me.  I started by getting rid of a bunch of things I didn't need. Freed up so much space in my life.  Great thread, Ben.
@sweatystartup Haha. Them's some good hacks, Nick.
@jessedanyusufco I don't use it, so I don't have an opinion, but many people swear by it.

@ZaneMcCormack 100%. I had a massive panic attack in December of 2018.  It was the worst day of my life.
@callmehouck Thanks for the inclusion with these wonderful newsletters. I greatly appreciate it!
@Nailingthreads I read a lot.
@dennis_geelen Yes. Very, very tough. That's why I have a "no" template.
@mattbarkercopy I turned off all notifications and I'm on DND 24/7 now. Love it!
@akashsaha__ Agreed.  It happens because of loss of control.
@jasonstrimpel I've got that on email and LinkedIn. Works like a charm.
@darentsmith Absolutely!
@SahilBloom I'm in a Discord group of people building similar lifestyles as mine which is super helpful.  For support, I do a weekly check-in with my wife, and a weekly check-in with my parents.
That's it.  If you're suffering from burnout, I hope these simple tips are helpful.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Seek professional help:   If you're struggling to overcome burnout, consider seeing a therapist.  There's no shame in therapy. In fact, it's the opposite.  I've seen a therapist off and on since I was 24 years old, and I can confidently say I perform better when I have one.
Prioritize your tasks:   What's actually important for you to get done?  Like, REALLY important?  Be honest with yourself and eliminate, automate, and delegate everything outside of the 20% of work that truly moves the needle.
Take time for yourself:   Back in 2018 and 2019 I had no hobbies.   It was just work, work, work.  Now, I  read, learn Spanish and cook on a regular basis. I love investing time in things that require no (or little) time on the computer.
Seek support:   Don't be afraid to seek support from friends, family, and colleagues.   Solopreneurship is really hard.  You need family and friends you can be open and transparent with, and you need a smart group of peers to help you realize when you're pushing too hard.
Get enough sleep:   Ever since 2020 I've been going to sleep around 9:30p or 10:00p and getting up around 6:00a.   When I was 30 I could work on 6 hours of sleep, but in my 40s, I need the whole 8.   This is arguably the most important part (for me) of avoiding burnout.
Set boundaries:   One of the easiest ways to burn out is to be a people pleaser.  Scrutinize each "ask" for your time and be stingy with it.  The best thing you can do is invest your time in your own self-care and with your family.
Exercise:  Each morning, I walk with my wife for 90 minutes or use the treadmill or elliptical machine at my local gym.  For me, exercise in the morning sets the right tone for the day and helps me make healthier choices as the day goes by.
Take breaks:  Make sure to take breaks throughout the day to rest and recharge.   I book 15 or 30-minute breaks in between all writing sessions and meetings I have on my calendar.  This helps prevent staring at the computer screen for 8 hours in a row which gives me anxiety.
I've worked myself to the point of burnout twice.  But in 2020, I finally got it under control.  Here are my 8 anti-burnout tips for solopreneurs:
@arvidkahl @agazdecki Impressive lineup! Looking fwd to hearing Andrew.  A real inspiring entrepreneur if you ask me.
@Nicolascole77 Your name must be on it.   Why I never have produced under a business name.

@bfillmer Thanks, Bryan!
@MarkShust @jayclouse I really just use Hemingway to make sure my writing is easy to understand. Sometimes it has bad recs, sometimes they are great. Use discretion.
@johnscharts @AthleticBrewing is one of my faves. Their new NA Triple IPA is my go-to during the week.
@thegoldsuite Yes, usually.
@jayclouse It's nice to keep things simple, Jay. I love it. And it's free.
@writingtoriches Thanks, man! :)
@foundersuccess @hypefury Hell yes. That's what I like to hear.
@SahilBloom Now to add a few tweaks in 2023...
@ranbirsinghlive Pick one platform and get really good. Or if it's just written, then maybe written cross-posting. But don't add insta - too much time for very little results.
@Joseph__Seifert Very simple, but very effective.
@liana_majed It's a lovely little app.
@NFT_GOD Love it!
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Step 5: Stay consistent  Writing consistently is the most important step of all.  Here's the TL;DR:  • Ideate with topics/structures • Format with tools like Typeshare • Edit with tools like Hemingway • Distribute with tools like HypeFury
Step 4: Distribute widely  99% of people waste distribution opportunities.  You've already written something.  Why not share it everywhere that's relevant?  I use @Hypefury to send my content to multiple platforms.  - Twitter - LinkedIn - Instagram  The tool is powerful as hell.  https://t.co/tP0o0MLsc9
Step 3: Edit ruthlessly  No easier way to lose a reader than unclear writing.  So, once I'm done, I pass my writing through @HemingwayApp  It tells me:  - The grade level - Poor word choices - Poor sentence structure  Paste in your writing and see where you can simplify.  https://t.co/JW2FM15qha
Step 2: Choose a solid format  Struggling to format your writing?  There are so many tools out there to help.  I am loving @typeshare_co  They have beautiful templates built right in for inspiration.  No better way to get started.  https://t.co/B135KOLW0n
Step 1: Ideate rapidly  What’s the fastest way to come up with ideas?  Use systems.  I created my own content matrix in Notion.  - Choose a topic - Match it to a style - Write a quick headline - Repeat until you have 10 ideas  Much of writing is about systems.  https://t.co/QrHxlphw58

@kylecordes @gregisenberg Build it.
@dickiebush Great exercise. You've just inspired me.
@Nicolascole77 Every Tweet is a sales and marketing person working on behalf of your company for hours, days, and sometimes weeks.
@gregisenberg Smart Tweet.
@agazdecki I saw this very clearly when building our sales organization. Very first salesperson must be an A+. Has to be. Sets the tone for everyone else.
@SeanPHogue @gregisenberg is your man.
@matt_gray_ Onboarding yourself is a really great term. Stealing that.
@gabe_llewellyn Thanks, man. Just a simple little list of projects, but hopefully helpful to someone.
@Farradfaizee Right. Them's the basics.
@FitFounder 100%. And there is no "right" way to approach these. A million combinations and orders out there.
@yairmenchel Haha. Reason #435 why I don't have children :)
@ChrisLaubWrites I do consider it one, yes.  Physical mail could be one too, I suppose!
@sam7rs Thanks, Samir.
@ASimpleNotion No. I'd like to keep it free to the reader, but I appreciate it.
@SahilBloom I get the feeling you're good :)
@FreddyExem Disagree. Keep it on the side until it replaces 60% of your total income, then go all in.
@gmitslouie 100%, Louie.
@barrettjoneill Agreed. Then use products to free up your time.
I break down these 4 examples in a recent newsletter issue:  - The pros - The cons - The tech  And more...  Read it here:    https://t.co/E0I3H8f496
4. Create a subscription email  Why I like subscription emails:  The scale is incredible.   As the customer base grows, the work effort generally remains the same, meaning that you make a lot more money without much extra work
3. Start a paid community  Why I like paid communities:  Building a space where people of similar interests can congregate improves your brand, builds trust, &amp; deepens relationships.  This helps grow your audience and build your business.  Get this right and it's powerful.
2. Create a digital course  Why I like digital courses:   People can purchase the courses 24/7/365.  Once you've serviced people using example 1 (above) take your biggest learnings and put them in a course.  Build a small affiliate program to drive even more sales.
1. Build a service-based business  Why I like a service-based business:   Generally, easier and lower cost to get started.  Plus you can likely charge 3x to 5x what you make (hourly) at your 9 to 5 job.  Find people 2-3 years behind you in your expertise and help them.
Everyone should have a side project that earns $150+ per day.  Here are 4 simple examples that might help:
@joserosado You get nothing tangible in return?
@oliviercantin THAT is what I was trying to say. Bravo.
@oliviercantin I think about this a lot.  The beliefs are always non-obvious (interesting &amp; against the status quo/norm) but predictable to those waiting for the belief - it's the medicine they crave over and over.   I don't know if that makes sense,

@thefernandocz @wizofecom @thedankoe @OneJKMolina @ItsKieranDrew Glad my content is helpful. I really appreciate it 🙌🏻
@chrishlad I have strong, natural opinions that are the opposite of "best practices" and I share them without hesitation.   I think identifying where you have different beliefs than the norm is a great place to start.
@dklineii So damn true.
@thealexbanks Thanks, Alex. Appreciate it, man.
@blakeaburge Thanks for being a willing participant 🙌
@CoachRizwani It sounds too good to be true until people try.
@jamierusso Thank you, Jamie. I appreciate it, man. :)
@UncleBimBim Take one small meaningful piece of action. Analyze. Then force another one. It's tough though!
@thechrisbaumann I never forgot it when I heard it.
@PrivatEquityGuy Happy Saturday, my man.
@SahilBloom So low.   You can do it with almost no money and very few tools.
@SahilBloom "Glorify the right things.   Let go of status symbols like busyness and 100-hour-weeks. Celebrate sleeping 8 hours, regular physical activity, and freedom. Control of your time is true wealth."  This is everything right here and where my whole

When people ask questions, share the link:  Now, when people ask questions, you can share your brand new link.  Sure, some people won't book, but some will.   And if 3-4 people do, you're paying off that mortgage faster than ever.  Congrats, you now have your first side business.
Continue focusing on the problem you solve:  The next part is critical.  Keep creating that red pill content.  Now that you have your business set up, you're ready to drive customers.  Push out content daily on LinkedIn/Twitter or anywhere else you normally hang out.
Add the link to your social profiles:  Attach your Carrd landing page to a custom URL and add it to your social pages.  - Twitter Bio - A personal website - LinkedIn featured section - Your YouTube Page  And anywhere else that people can find you online.
Open up a few slots outside of your 9 to 5:  Pick a few times outside of your 9 to 5 where you'd like to make a bit of extra cash.  Maybe it's just 3-4 hours per week, but if you fill those slots, that's an extra $2,000 or more per month.  That's some people's mortgage.
Choose a reasonable price point:  Start with a price that people are willing to pay.  But make it 2x to 3x what you make at work.  For example, if you make $100k at work, that's basically $50/hour.  Try $150/hour.  Experiment often to find the sweet spot.
Create a paid coaching call:  "From X to Y in 60 minutes"  The more specific you can make the outcome, the better.  It's not: "Learn to code" It's: "From clueless to coding your first HTML page in 60 minutes."  The outcome is clear.  You'll learn to code your first page in HTML.
Open up a Calendly account ($12):  Open up a Calendly account &amp; embed it on your landing page.  This provides a seamless way to get people into your calendar for your new business consulting/coaching.  Now, let's make it easy for people to understand what they'll get.
Embed 5-8 testimonials:  Social proof helps close deals.  Ask the 10 people you helped for free to write you some.  Tell them to talk about the problem they had and how you solved it.  Put the testimonials near the top so people see them.  Get some near your "buy" button.
Build a landing page on Carrd ($19):  Once you have a standardized process, you need a place to offer it.  I recommend using @Carrd to build simple, beautiful, functional landing pages for just $19 per year.  Here are 5 tips for building a great one:
Create standard processes:  Once you understand the problem, you need a solution.  But it's best when standardized.  A step-by-step process that predictably delivers high-quality results for the people you intend to help.  This is a more scalable process than ad-libbing it.
Chat with 10 people for free:  Work to get 10 people on Zoom who have the same problem.  A problem you can solve with your "red pill" thinking.  Do deep discovery in 4 levels:  L1: Technical problem L2: Historical problem L3: Financial impact L4: Personal impact
Look for questions + DM opportunities:  When you create content like that, you're going to get questions.  Questions present opportunity.  When you're starting, leverage a combo of public/private responses.  Answer questions publically, and take it to DM to add deeper context.
Create Red Pill content around one challenge:  "Red pill" content is something I heard @ShaanVP say on a podcast and I've never forgotten it.  Your content should present a new take. A new angle.  A different approach than other people take to solve a challenge.  Be different.
Clean up your profiles:  Your social media profiles are mini landing pages.  With one glance, prospects should know:  - Who you are - What journey you are on - What people should expect if they follow you  Capture attention by being clear, not clever.
By the end of this thread you will have:  1. Clear social profiles 2. "Red pill" content 3. Deep customer knowledge 4. A standardized service business 5. Simple technology to run it 6. Great social proof for it 7. A better process for making $$  Let's go ↓

@dickiebush These pics are just insane.
@grdeken @KateBour @kamilrextin @ChelseaCastle @AdrienneNakohl I have a Subaru :)
@ZubyMusic It took me 12 years to reach 8,000 followers and 1 year to reach 250,000.
@Zbijelic @BrandonFluharty Yes. Santa Barbara, CA
@BrandonFluharty Nashville is a great city for some people.   It just didn't work for us for some reason that I can't describe.  We decided we wanted more land, more privacy, but access to a massive city like NYC.  This has been almost perfect so far.
@danprimack Every problem like this deserves a solution.   Who is out there solving this problem? Anyone?
@ethanwnel I mean IRL gatherings, not online.
@MichaelNatelli These are IRL meetings where people don't know anything about me.
@bfillmer @andrewhosf Jennifer and I do this a lot. We grill every server (in a good way) and are just genuinely curious in their life plans. I guess that's what 41 will do to ya.
@spontaneousbkpk I don't know that I have one.  I just like engaging with people back and forth. It's weird when I meet someone, ask them 15 questions, and then at the end of the night, they come back and are like, "Oh yeah -  I forgot to ask. What's your
@deanjmoon IRL.
@helloworld_agna I just mean in simple IRL gatherings.
@khemaridh This is a great response. Thanks, Khe!
@GuruAnaerobic I should have said strangers because that's what I meant. IRL strangers.
@iamjankoch Haha. These are IRL meetings.
@CryptoB513 Great. Thanks for asking!
@ChrisLaubWrites IRL
@bfillmer Most likely!
@CodyCLewis I just like to ask people what they do, and then ask follows ups based on what they say.
@fellowalk I ask questions like crazy. But at the end of the night, people won't have even asked my name, or where I'm from, or just regular ol' questions.
@JesseHercules Smart moves.
@EngineerDogBlog @HewittRueben Haha. I didn't mean for that to sound arrogant in any way, shape, or form.  I just wanted to clarify that this wasn't directed at people I meet online. Just random people in my offline life.
@bfillmer good question :)   Gatherings where people literally have no idea I'm on social media.  Events. Introductions in person. Dinners.  I don't remember it being like this before...
@seantconrad Sad. But I like what you did there.
@brendan_aronson These aren't people from calls per se.  They are more just regular life interactions.
@creation247 Maybe. Bummer.
@HewittRueben These are people who have no idea who I am or that I'm on social media.
@SeanAnthonySays Goodness.
@SePP But to answer your question, I just like to know people's story.  What do you do? How did you get into that? How long have you been doing it? Why? Where can I learn more? What's next on the horizon? Big goals for 2023?
@Nicolascole77 Haha. Maybe. I was taught that and I'm annoying as hell about asking people things.
@SePP I ask a million questions.  But these aren't followers or people on Twitter. Just people I meet at friends' houses or random events.  They just talk and talk and talk and talk.
90% of new people I meet don't ask me a single question.  Are people becoming less curious or just more self-absorbed?
@Nicolascole77 This is right up my alley.  A million ways to make money, because there are a million problems and a million solutions.
If you try solopreneurship and fall flat on your face, then you're basically in the same position you're in today, but armed with significantly more knowledge and experience for having tried.
@businessbarista Glad they were helpful. If I think of anything else that's been on my mind, happy to share, Alex.
@feelthebyrn1 Love to hear this :)
@businessbarista 1. When it's time to shut down your business 2. Raising capital when you're not well connected 3. Building high-growth, yet highly ethical businesses  Just a few things my friends and I have been chatting about.
@dickiebush Start. Then learn. - Sahil Lavingia
@thedankoe And patience.
@0xjammin I'll take mine :)
@gabe_llewellyn Yep. Projects I want to work on and time with my wife.
@SachinRamje Absolutely. If you don't want to keep the door open, you can also remove that part.
@PaulEmekaEze I don't include that if I'm not interested.
@jayclouse Nice. I'll give this a read, Jay.
@bryhutch Good call :)
@FitFounder Glad they are helpful, man.
@SahilBloom Thanks, man.
@matt_gray_ It's gotta be high-touch, high-explanation.
@SahilBloom Curious question:  How do you determine when to push through procrastination and when to treat it as a feature?  Meaning, if we constantly procrastinate doing something, is it always something we should be doing in the first place?
@I_Am_GKennedy Exactly. Excellent comment.
@foundersuccess That's the key. It can't feel harsh. I feel like this email has accomplished that.
@jasonstrimpel Nice. It's helpful to have a great way to let people down a bit.
@TheDannyNaz Thanks, man. This one email has been a life changer for me.
That's it for today.  If you enjoyed this short thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
You can copy and paste this email and use it yourself, or send it to your VA to use it.  So far, in over 2 years, I've never received a poor response from this email that I've put together.  It took me a long time to get it right. So save yourself time and copy it.
Thank them again and wish them luck:  "Again, thanks for thinking of me. Best of luck with the {{Ask}}, {{FirstName}}."
Suggest a future date:  "Please feel free to reach out to me again in 90 days or so, and I might be in a better position to accept."
Let them know they aren't alone in getting a no:  "I field a lot of requests and realize that I need to say no if I hope to make meaningful progress on my these projects."
Use a cushioned transition:  "I hope you won’t take this personally."
Share why you're saying no:  "Unfortunately, with my {{Project1}}, {{Project2}} and {{Project3}}, I'm at capacity and can't book anything else at the moment."
Start with a thank you:  "Thanks for thinking of me for your {{Ask}}. I really appreciate it and I normally love doing stuff like this."
Saying 'No' is a solopreneur superpower.  But it's incredibly hard to do.  So steal these 6 steps to the perfect "No" email you can use:
@matt_gray_ Company of One by Paul Jarvis is another great one for the solopreneurs  out there.

@CassandraLRosen It was fabulous. No need to sell up here. It’s a 552 person town with 3 restaurants.
@TomMullooly @ibuyrvparks 80 minutes from me.
@ibuyrvparks @TomMullooly Oh nice. You’re just an hour from me.
@TomMullooly @ibuyrvparks Nice. I’m south on the west side of the Hudson.

@ibuyrvparks I am. Upstate. You?
@drgurner Nope. It’s at the restaurant I’m at.

Wednesday nights in Hudson Valley. No more office days.  https://t.co/EtAlKs8qWz
@binaryhubio Both. The internal knowing + the validation.
@MaxiGillberg Shitty. Then motivating. Then awesome.
@thealibilawal Best reply.
@TheDannyNaz Heck yeah. One of my favorite quotes.
@CoachMacUK It was exactly what I needed.
@Joseph__Seifert For sure, Joseph!
@thejoshuageelen It sure is. I felt like I was letting him down.
@carolebozkurt They sure were for me.
The most life-changing words someone ever said to me were, 'I think you're capable of much more.'
@writes_eve That's awesome!  To be clear, I worked a day job for 17 years. And I'm not advocating that people don't work them.  I'm suggesting that if you want to eventually find the maximum return for your time invested, it will almost never be through t
@schlaf Thank you, Steve 🙌
@writes_eve Genuine question:   What happens when you work a day job and create on the side, but the day job gets eliminated?   Are you suggesting that the work on the side is a means to eventually leave or simply to be on the side forever?   Thanks, Eve.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with working for someone else, but you'll almost always underprice your most valuable asset: your time.
@heykahn Yep.  And even higher if you teach $100k, which is an incredibly good business and should be celebrated.
@TheDannyNaz Or second.
@TaniaDiscovered For sure.   My advice should be taken while recognizing context is extremely important, just like anyone else's advice.
@I_Am_GKennedy Yep. In everything.
@adityatheverma @dvassallo Daniel is one of the best playing the game.
@jasonstrimpel Once you know that, you can play the game more effectively.
@jessedanyusufco Learn from others while recognizing that all advice requires context.  Go do. What works for you is what works.
Every top entrepreneur you hear about on the news is a massive outlier.  Just remember that when taking advice.
@mattragland You got this 🙏
The popular entrepreneurship narrative is to risk it all, triple down, and give 110% effort, 24/7, with no plan B.  The better narrative is to replace 60%-70% of your income and then go all in.

@ItsKieranDrew Thanks for the inclusion with these superstars, Kieran.
@SahilBloom So low. It's incredible how this has changed just in the last 5 years.
@thealexbanks Some people just build things they believe are "cool" and end up being frustrated when people don't want to pay for it.
@AaronBatcheldr Oooh. Love this.
@marcuscelestin_ Mostly making assumptions rather than truly understanding what people want.
@blakeaburge Thank you, Blake!
@theantonioreza @ericries A terrific book.
@FitFounder Ha. Thanks man!
@byhazellim 100%. Experience comes from executing over and over and learning. Like anything else.
@jasonstrimpel 100%. I like to look at review sites and look for the top complaints.
@danielcberk 100%. A step most people need to nail.
@darentsmith Absolutely. Love how you've phrased this here, Daren.
@PrivatEquityGuy Follow these steps, solve problems, and get ahead.
@iambergerapi Welcome, Niclas.
And that's it.   A simple step-by-step to build your first product for your audience.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
10/ Develop &amp; Expand:  As the MVP gains traction and proves its value, continue to develop and expand the product to meet the evolving needs of users.  Look for areas to increase stickiness, reduce churn, improve word-of-mouth, and solve additional problems you hear from users.
9/ Analyze &amp; improve:  Continuously monitor and analyze user behavior and feedback to identify areas for improvement and new features to add.  Don't let one customer pull you in any specific direction, no matter how big.  Focus on commonalities across pros and cons.
8/ Launch:   Launch the MVP and begin gathering data and feedback from users.   Use this information to improve and iterate on the product over time.  Do your hypotheses from testing with Beta users prove to be true across a wider audience of users?
7/ Use a lean building approach:  Build the MVP using tools you already know how to use.  This means focusing on the core features and functionality and avoiding unnecessary bells and whistles.  Not a dev? Go no-code with tools like Carrd, Stripe, Airtable, Zapier, etc.
6/ Get testing:  Test the prototype with your target audience to gather feedback and make any necessary adjustments.  You want to make sure you're focusing on things like ease of use, stickiness, why users might churn out, etc.   Most importantly: Does this solve the big problem?
5/ Find your beta customers:  Your beta customers are likely some of the same people you had conversations with when you started.  Go back to them, restate the problem, share the prototype, and ask if they'd be willing to use it at a low cost in exchange for early feedback.
4/ Build out your prototype:  Create a prototype of your MVP.   This can be a simple mockup or a more detailed wireframe.   The goal is to get a sense of how the product will look and function so that you can put it in front of potential users.
3/ Prioritize the most important features:  Create a list of features that fill the gaps you discovered above.   Your MVP will need to have these in order to truly solve the problem.  Prioritize them based on their potential impact and the resources required to implement them.
2/ Begin your research phase:  Start by diving deeper into conversations about the problem &amp; where potential solutions fall short.  Check ProductHunt, G2 Crowd, &amp; other review sites.  This will help you understand the landscape &amp; identify potential gaps in competitive solutions.
1/ Identify an unsolved problem in the market:  Start by identify a problem or gap in the market you want to serve.  The easiest way? Talk to your audience, look through your comments, check your emails and DMs.  This will be the focus of your MVP.
How to launch a minimum viable product (MVP).  10 incredibly clear steps anyone can follow:
@alexgarcia_atx Automation has allowed me to run my business with only one, part-time VA. It's incredible how you can assemble specialists using Zapier and a few other tools.
@Kyler_Nixon Yeah, probably. Will give it some thought, thanks!

My entire business plan is to do what I want, when I want, with whom I want and do very little of what I hate.
@sweatystartup That’s because we’re impressed with futurists whom “solve” problems in this tiny echo chamber.   Thanks for the VR goggles.   I’d like to just get my medical records from one provider to another without a fax machine.
@Nicolascole77 Reinforces the importance of taking action.
@dickiebush Damn. That's interesting. I do a lot of this in the morning, but hadn't thought of starting the night before. Hmm. Might try this tonight.
@FitFounder Short-term results never fix long-term abuse.
@thedankoe You can buy a book for $24 that will give you the permission to get started. You can invest $99 in a course and thousands of dollars worth of tactics.  The problem? Most people want even shorter shortcuts.
@AnAnasRaza Certainly one of them.
@danielcberk Nah, just an arbitrary number to be honest.  Retirement for me isn't about not working - I love working.  It's more about not having to care about whether it's successful or not.
@theshahkunal Carrd + Stripe and you're in the game in 10 minutes.
@AlFaslivingroom I worked for a really demanding entrepreneur back in 2009-2014 who changed how I think about working towards a goal.  I don't think I'd be the person I am today if I hadn't worked for him.
@ItsKieranDrew Haha.  True.  Focus on the 20% that moves the needles and eliminate, delegate and automate everything else.
@blakeaburge Don't get too high on the high days and don't get too low on the low days. That's the ticket right there.
@leonklam Here's a short Thread I wrote that's just one way to get started:  https://t.co/yChTdO5vLU
@theficouple This is such a great comment. You captured it perfectly here.
@NikatNite20 That, and compounding :)
@jasonstrimpel That's it. Just keep being there.
@natolisnuggets Walking a damn marathon.
Sometimes, being a successful solopreneur is less about great content, the perfect product, a flashy website, or complex systems.   It's just about resiliency.   One foot in front of the other, every single day for like 5,000 days.
@jayclouse We're on reverse courses.
@BrianSexton13 Definitely. Regardless of the definition, we should aim to achieve that specific definition rather than filling our calendars with things that don't help us achieve that definition.   I think we're probably saying the same thing. albeit sli

@matt_gray_ Love these.  I met @DanBenoni from Growth Design a few weeks ago.  Super nice guy and love his stuff.
@TMitrosilis That man said it better than me.
@BrianSexton13 I'm not really talking about achievement here.  I'm simply talking about how people fool themselves into thinking they are productive, when in fact, they are just busy.
@remoteoliver I am often some people.
@theshahkunal That's an awesome term, Kunal. I love that.

Busyness is a seductive liar.  It paints intense activity as achievement, masking the truth that you're often busy doing nothing productive.
@MrPassive_ @aaditsh @matt_gray_ Thanks, Mike! Just seeing this now.
@mlange221 @LeilaHormozi I don’t have kids.
@yongfook This is a schedule I can get down with.   You’re a hero in the indie maker world, Jon.   Keep doing your thing.
@davidstache @LeilaHormozi I usually do the elliptical first and then just a few lifts. Nothing too strenuous.appreciate the guidance though. I’m no exercise expert by any means honestly.
@AnthonyTumbiolo @LeilaHormozi Yeah no worries. the "?" was not intentional, just missed the period :)
@AnthonyTumbiolo @LeilaHormozi google calendar?
@vannlaniakea @LeilaHormozi Go for it!
@Pig_Pic_ @LeilaHormozi The yellow blocks are flexible.
@davidstache @LeilaHormozi Happy to do something better, but I'm not an optimization machine.  Just enjoy the gym. Any recommendations welcome.
@Chris_Schuering @LeilaHormozi Just a company I'm using to do video chats with customers.
@ShaunEls @LeilaHormozi Busy ≠ productive
@TiMMRDesigns @LeilaHormozi I agree. Just presenting a different option.
@bomenardco @LeilaHormozi When I was in college Elliptical machines were called EFX's (I have two back surgeries and can't run anymore) so I keep calling it EFX.
@LeilaHormozi I run a one-person business that does $2M a year in net income, giving me roughly the same access to things that make people happy, work less than 40% of this, and I don't need to work myself to death to do it.   Here's a routine that won't 
@peter_osborne I don’t like them.
@RyanMHess I'm transparent about my revenue all of the time. I'm not sure what you're referencing 🤨
@ItsBeauBurns We did, but The Netherlands had many more. And they capitalized.  We need a true world-class striker.
@Joseph__Seifert Same. I can't wait to go in 2026. I'll be there.
@jkhasson Yep. Our effort was there, our skill was just overmatched. The Netherlands were extremely machine like and prepared.
@KateBour Thank you. If you ever feel like I do that, call me on it. It's something I never want to do or be a part of.
@KateBour I think it's all about how you share it.  It's less about "look at me!" and more about "here's the success I've had by doing X, and here's what I learned, how you can learn it too, and how it can impact your business."   We need more female crea
@daviddomm Awesome!
@JulieChenell WOW!
@MichelleJOkafor Boom! Congrats :)
@Moimaere Good stuff!
@matt_gray_ The Heineken one. Damn.
@SahilBloom Different strokes for different outcomes, too.  My guess would be that you'd be more likely to share big wins for your portfolio companies. Is that true or am I off base?
@eagermehul It generates interest in what you're doing.
@Path_Of_progres Thanks, Idisi.
@Zbijelic Shine a light on yourself. Nobody else is as likely to do so.
@dklineii Not for me, no. Usually just lots of followers and website visits.   But maybe I'm in for a bad surprise in the future?
@PrivatEquityGuy Happy to share more of those. There are plenty.  Thanks for the feedback.
@ImraneSubstack Hell yeah :) Congrats man!
@PaulineRiviere Those are true friends.
@Craig_Gigged We all do.
If you hit some incredible revenue milestone or big business goal, get on Twitter and tell the world about it.  Stop worrying about how people will react and start being your own one-person PR firm.
@blakeaburge I’ve already overspent 🤦‍♂️
@sweatystartup We don’t know each other that well, but I followed you for your intelligent insights, starting with your famous whiskey thread.   Much prefer that to the baiting. Looking fwd to more great content, Nick.
@jackbutcher @gmoneyNFT @benzistudio Woah. Massive congrats, Jack.
@MarkShust Put your knowledge in a book and you're a romanticized author.  Put it in a course and you're automatically a scam artist.  Funny how that works, huh?
@agazdecki The more you say no, the bigger your best yes can be.
@FitFounder Aiming for 18k steps per day. One of the great things my wife and I have done is walk everywhere on vacation. We'll do like 10 miles per day seeing a new city.
@thedankoe It's amazing the difference in outcomes between being obsessed and figuring that obsession out on your own, and doing something you hate for someone else.
@FitFounder A very large margin, especially if you know how to handle it.
@marcuscelestin_ That will be in my newsletter tomorrow.
@agazdecki Well, I love it. Thanks for sharing.
@agazdecki This is a fabulous quote. Where is this from?
@blakeaburge Appreciate you, man. I think we need to get another call on the books, no?
@SahilBloom So do I now.   There was a time when I didn't.
@oledoteth Hell yeah. Keep going!
@hilekonidas See you there.
@successcreatorr appreciate it.
@ant_carlton For sure. I never want to be divisive (we've got enough of that), but I certainly share my strongly held opinions.
@bryhutch Yep. It's about sticking to your guns.
@darentsmith Develop thick skin over years, Daren.
@TheDannyNaz I love that thought process, Danny.

3 harsh truths about creating online:  1. Nobody will care about you at first.  2. Somebody will ridicule you &amp; people will join in.  3. You'll get trolled by somebody who wants to hurt you.  Tomorrow, I'll show 63k subscribers how to ignore this &amp; get started.  Join us below ↓
@jodywinter @BlaettlerMartin @noahkagan 👋 Happy to chat, Noah
@natolisnuggets Congrats my man. Stay strong.
@jayclouse Congrats my man!
@PrivatEquityGuy Ahh. Not quite. $239k last month for the business.
@Zbijelic Thank you man. Means a lot when people stop to say something nice. Keeps me going!
@1on1dan @SahilBloom Thank you!
@PrivatEquityGuy When you say main number, what do you mean exactly?
@joshdviner I appreciate that, Josh. That's what I'm trying do :)
@Nicolascole77 Thank you, my man!
@SahilBloom Very cool. I didn't even need to see the image to know that walking gets my brain "juices" flowing.
@SahilBloom Thanks, man.  Likely going to double down on that in the future because of feedback like this.
@Joseph__Seifert It was an interesting thing for sure. My intention wasn't to get one, and maybe that's why I did?
@AnthonyVicino Thanks, Anthony!

@SahilBloom Wish I had this when I got a 1.9 my freshman year in college.
@marcotonycampos Thanks, Marco!
@DanijelNagradic That's how I think about it, Danijel.
@bfillmer Same.
@AuthorOnTheSide I sure hope so, Hassan.
@Nicolascole77 It's just a reminder to myself as well. I also tend to be a workaholic. It's breaking the habit that's so difficult.
I have zero interest in optimizing my schedule to squeeze as much productivity as possible out of every day.  I'm not a solopreneur so I can "maximize time" and be "hyper-productive".  I'm a solopreneur so I can spend more time with my wife &amp; spend less time doing things I hate.
@Nicolascole77 Love this. I might steal some of these tips for my own website. Thanks for the mention, Cole!
@bgardner @jayclouse @jeremycowart This is insane. This got me so amped up.   Thanks for sharing!   I need to figure out what to do with this energy.
@abhishekshah173 @jayclouse Gonna make it happen.   I'll shoot you a note when I do.
@unboundedyou @jayclouse 100%. Would love that. Amplify critical voices.
@nathanbarry I'd bet you can.
@abhishekshah173 @jayclouse Heck yeah. My #1 place I want to visit there. Looks like foodie paradise.
@willstew @jayclouse Small bets co! 🔥
@TheIndependentU @jayclouse I think so too. I'm amped up about this. Now to just make it happen...
@wordsbysusmita @jayclouse I can't wait to come visit.   My wife has been to Mumbai and Pune, but I've never been.
@trainedwright @jayclouse Intro away. I'm just kicking this idea around and would love to know about people who would be down. We'd pay for ourselves and make no money.  Needs to be someone down for that.
@TheFalanBlake @jayclouse I don't know yet, to be honest. I haven't thought this through entirely, but I know that African tech is growing like wildfire.  I want to be a part of that.  Need to learn more about what location would be most central.
@jayclouse I want to go to Africa &amp; India with a pro photographer and do keynotes on social media growth &amp; entrepreneurship.  Then, I want to give everyone complimentary headshots they can take home to start sprucing up their profiles as a gift.  
If you keep bookmarking Tweets about solopreneurship but you've never built something of your own, maybe less bookmarking and more little leaps of faith.
@thedankoe One thing I’ve noticed is self-sufficiency often separates the average from the excellent. Learning to learn on one’s own.

@blakeaburge Cranking these out man. How many templates do you have now?
@nathanjjmartin I neglected to include Stripe fees the first time I wrote that (stupid mistake) and then started to afterwards so it’s only fallen a few points.
@sweatystartup Damn. Didn’t realize Moses Kagan owned that much real estate. Solid.
@therobertleonar I started by teaching people how to build SaaS companies in the healthcare technology vertical.  This whole "audience building" thing was never my intention.
@thedankoe Yep. Humanize yourself.
@sweatystartup  https://t.co/bftoomMoOs
@nathanjjmartin I'm investing in more technology to automate. Margins go down, but my free time to invest goes up.
@KrisOgrabek How much of my gross revenue is profit.
@heyjoeyjustice That's how I hope people think about my threads. THanks, Joey!
@SystemSunday Thank you, Ben!
@TaniaDiscovered I have very little figured out. Just tons of action, mistakes, failures, and a few wins that even it all out.
@SahilBloom Thank you. Fun doing it@!
@matt_gray_ Right? An often missed part of creating.
@foundersuccess Thank you so much, Marcus :)
@thealexbanks I appreciate that, ALex!
@sweatystartup I don't wanna manage anyone. But I'd hear you out :)
@blakeaburge Funny how showing up at the right party makes all of the difference.
@TheMBA_coach @dvassallo Thanks, Ashley :)
@floheitzmann Good problems to have.
@sweatystartup I'm trying to build a very small empire that allows me freedom and flexibility. Here's to achieving it (I hope).
@FitFounder I try to practice what I preach. Glad it was helpful, man.
@PrivatEquityGuy Thanks, man!
@jayclouse @MariusCern And the mention!
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Explore How to Use Community:  1. Get feedback 2. Get beta testers 3. Build an affiliate program 4. Get your first testimonials 5. Presell with a great discount 6. Get support for your content  And so on.  Monetization is now MUCH easier.  It's on you to get creative.
Finally, Monetize:  With a community of fans, monetization becomes a lot easier.  You basically have a "shopping mall". A captive audience.  People are looking to buy and you're the store owner.  No algorithm. No open rates. No friction.  Here are some things you can do:
Deepen Relationships:  Once trust is built, you can build deep relationships.  Use community to show a "behind-the-scenes" glimpse.  It's easier to invite someone once they trust your expertise.  Build your community of fans like @jayclouse    https://t.co/K4mNErFr0D
Learn to "Deplatform":  I started a newsletter because I wanted to "deplatform" my audience from social media to something I actually own:   An email address.  I've found this is the best way to guard against the unforeseen, like algorithm changes or being banned.  A must.
Leverage How-to Videos:  Don't like interviewing? Turn the camera around on yourself.  This is a great way to build trust by literally walking people through how to do something.  A master at this is @aliabdaal  Check out his channel below:  https://t.co/RCVxem7VxF
Start a Podcast:  If you don't want to write, start a podcast.  It shows your expertise, and you get the side benefit of connecting w/ interesting people.  Social proof!  Like how @dickiebush &amp; @nicolascole77 do it on the Ship30for30 podcast:  https://t.co/8PnCVFYhap
Write a Newsletter:  A newsletter is a great way to show your expertise.  Long-form allows you to go deeper &amp; more tactical in teaching.  You're showing people how your brain works.  I write to 61,000+ subscribers each week in The Saturday Solopreneur:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
Build Trust:  Once you get discovered, you must build a deeper level of trust.  Not trust in the traditional sense of the word, but trust in your expertise.  That you actually know what you're doing &amp; can back up what you talk about.  This is critical.  So how do you do that?
Learn To Actually Add Value:  All of these pieces of content are intended to "add value" to the reader.  It's a phrase that is used so often, but people rarely understand how to approach it.  But, it's not a mystery.   Here's my favorite way to describe it, from @dvassallo  https://t.co/eIsm9qxbPe
Empathize With People:  Some content reaches your audience &amp; says, "I understand what you're going through" or, "you're not alone".   This content draws your audience in closer &amp; greatly humanizes an otherwise inanimate social media profile.  Like this:
Challenge People:  Content that challenges perceptions should get the reaction:  "I've never thought of it like that before", or... "What an interesting observation" or just... "Damn."  Open people up to a new perspective and win.  Like this Tweet:
Entertain People:  Teaching is helpful, but if you hammer your audience with teachings 100% of the time, you run the risk of boring them.   If you bore them, you might get tuned out.   You don't have to be a comedian. But switching it up can help.  Like this Tweet:
Teach People (educate):  The easiest way to get discovered is by teaching prospective followers &amp; customers how to do something.  These are "tactical" Tweets and threads that show off a bit of your expertise.  Share your knowledge!  Like this:
Get Discovered:  If nobody finds your thoughts/ideas, nothing else matters.  You want to start by creating valuable content where people are already consuming.  - Twitter - LinkedIn - TikTok - Etc.  There are 4 ways to do this:  1. Educate 2. Entertain 3. Challenge 4. Empathize
Build a creator funnel:  This is a simple journey your audience goes through, increasing the chance they become a customer at each step.  It has 4 key parts:  1. Discovery 2. Trust 3. Relationships 4. Monetization  The first part is getting discovered.
In 2019, I had never made even $1 online.   3.5 years later:  - 468M+ content impressions on 2 platforms - $3.07M in online income at 94% margins - 5 successful revenue streams  Here are 15 short (but important) lessons from my journey:

@Nicolascole77 Good news. I have none of these.
The luckiest people I know have coincidentally been working hard for decades.
@katairobi @KateBour @SahilBloom @jackbutcher @Aazarshad @jayclouse Thanks, man!
@ItsKieranDrew I like this formula. Copyright that :)
@jayclouse Yes. Consistency itself won't help you win long term. You have to be consistently better.
@dickiebush I try and incorporate 15-min after meal walks. I don't always do it, but when I do, I feel so much better.
@FitFounder Water up, alcohol down, body fat down.
@thedankoe It's funny that lack of experience keeps people from starting, because starting is the only way to change that.
@dvassallo Congrats! Big numbers. One of the best decisions I made last-minute was to do a BF sale. So glad I did.
@alexgarcia_atx It certainly is, man!
@TheDannyNaz Satisfied customers send me 30% of my business today.
@SahilBloom Nailed it.
@HellloHar @dvassallo Around $95k.
@bfillmer I sure hope so, Bryan.
@FitFounder It's funny because if you truly focus on helping people, the money comes...Win/Win.
@adityatheverma Great comment. I appreciate that shift in thinking and had a similar one myself.
@degasel_ It's so underrated.  But as long as we keep glorifying scam artists, we'll be served a heaping helping of them.
@bryhutch Not a bad take at all.  But, I just can't understand this "get money, screw people" mentality that so many have.
@thejoshuageelen Exactly, Joshua.
The most rebellious thing you can do is build a company that helps other people rather than one focused solely on top-line revenue like a lot of these money-at-all-costs buffoons we put on pedestals.

@matt_gray_ Getting rejected is often a blessing.  Self-rejection is almost never a blessing.  Be smart about how you treat yourself.
@pathofvalues I still have a sore back :) 2x surgeries
@AuthorOnTheSide I've learned so much doing my own thing, that if I ever went back to work for a company, I believe I would be 100x more valuable than before.
@selfientdavid Thanks, David!
@selfientdavid Or just a really awesome lifestyle business.
@pathofvalues That's not true.   That's a specific type of entrepreneurship. I've never had a sleepless night or a 19-hour day in 4 years running my own thing.
@TomThorleyx The people who retort it are the people who know it's true but can't figure it out.
@bryhutch Basically. Be excellent at something and you have significantly more options.
@jasonstrimpel Correct. "More" passive was intentional. Nothing is actually passive no matter how much people claim it is.
@bryhutch It gives you leverage and optionality that other employees don't have.
@foundersuccess Thanks, Marcus!
@jasonstrimpel 2 streams. Active 9 to 5 and a more passive 24/7.
If you're one of the best employees at your company, you should damn sure be building something for yourself on the side.  When a company is willing to pay you for your knowledge and skills, the open market will likely pay you more.
@thecolbykultgen Thanks, Colby!
@0xsash The whole Midwest. It’s a reflex you don’t lose.
@TheHunterBohm @0xsash Damn. I used the same clue (Ope!)
@0xsash If you bump into me in LeBron's home city, I might say "Ope!".
@blakeaburge This will go well with a rereading of Atomic Habits :)

Side note: Most people fail when they start their first online business.  The reasons they fail are exhaustive:  - Wrong niche - Wrong messaging - Wrong ideal customer - Wrong pricing structure - Wrong product offering - And more  Want to give yourself a better chance at success?
Solopreneurship 101:  Don't quit your job and then start building your own business.  Find 60 minutes per day to work on your business and use your job as investment capital.   Once your business is paying your salary, then consider going all in.  Almost always a better choice.
@petergyang Thank you my man!
@FitFounder Even though I just remembered you're Canadian 😂
@FitFounder This right here 👆🏻 Happy Thanksgiving my man.
@SahilBloom Happy Thanksgiving, my friend.
@alexgarcia_atx Thankful for you my man.
Imagine that next year on Thanksgiving, you're thankful because you finally pressed GO on that idea, product, service, community, or content that you've been constantly thinking about shipping.  Start tomorrow.  Eat some food and enjoy time with your family today.
@wes_kao I love how many people are focused on positive reframes lately. Good thread, Wes 👍🏻
How successful solopreneurs operate:  - Has an idea - Talks to their ICP - Builds MVP solution - Drives traffic through content - Validates  Why most solopreneurs fail:  - Has an idea - Researches - Researches - Researches - Gets frustrated by tech - Researches more - Quits
@dickiebush Please tell me that's a Buckeyes hat?
@tspeeg Love it!
@InspiringSia Efforts don't have to be crazy. Just consistent.
@theantonioreza Certainly. Also doable.
@HeyAmna1 Talking to them.
@thealexjjohnson Eat the elephant one bite at a time.
@matt_gray_ It took me a long time to put health first, Matt. So glad I did.
There are 4,950,000,000 internet-connected people waiting to get better at a number of different things.  Can you find 4 each day that will pay you $70 to learn one of those skills?  If so, you have a $100k+ business.  Not easy, but also not as daunting as you might think.
@thedankoe Great visual man. 🔥
Making money will never be enough of a driving factor to succeed as a solopreneur.  If you don't love what you do, who you help, and the problem you solve, you'll eventually burn out.  Find the one thing that gets you out of bed like a bat out of hell each morning and do that.
@VladiWealth @Yannick_Veys Money is an outcome.  Without a real "why" you'll never make some.
@Yannick_Veys Impact other people.
@sweatystartup I call this Shiny Outcome Syndrome.  I've always wanted the latter.  Then I see someone with 5 houses and I'm like, "Damn".  Gotta do it for the right reasons though.
@dickiebush Excellent breakdown, man.   Damn you look like a different guy. Congrats, Dickie!

@blakeaburge Awesome. No debt at the moment.  Got an investment one??
@bfillmer Haha. I wanted to make sure it wasn't just some listicle of tools and instead a list of how I use them. Hopefully helpful!
@kwazs @drgurner Zirtual
@mauraball @hypefury No.
@bfillmer Is it just a list, or how they are used? I think the latter is important.
@SystemSunday Appreciate you, Ben!
@blakeaburge @usefathom Fathom is amazing man. Takes 2 seconds to set up too.
@bfillmer @usefathom same.
@talktoterryco @hypefury There's instructions inside Hypefury.
@KCProcter @FitFounder It's not but I could probably cobble it together someday.
@drgurner 1 part-time VA (20 hours per month). That's it.
@anthony_astbury @zapier I'd love one :)
@anthony_astbury @zapier Heck yes. Thanks for being a customer!
@_robwilloughby @Kajabi Potentially, yes.
@FitFounder Yep. And I just started with $19 a year on Carrd
@dennis_geelen Big learning curve. Worth it once you understand it though.
@brianondrako @NotionHQ My wife and I can collaborate on things, plus I can share with other people should I need to.
@tomosman  https://t.co/KePGfBJSNk
@alexgarcia_atx @zapier Many will not, unfortunately, Alex.
@ChaseAHappyLife Appreciate that, Chase!
@matt_gray_ Thank you, my man.
@SahilBloom Very little. When I started it was just $19 for a Carrd website and that was it :)

LinkedIn Analytics: @getshieldapp   Shield is way more than just LinkedIn analytics.  It's the perfect tool for repurposing, saving old posts, and truly understanding what's working.  With 245k+ followers, it's a must for me.  Cost: $16/month  https://t.co/uXVCHlUjHy
Web Analytics: @usefathom  I find Google Analytics to be difficult to use and understand.  That's OK because Fathom Analytics is amazing.  It takes less than 2 minutes to set up and gives me all of the analytics I need in one simple dashboard.  Cost: $24/month  https://t.co/ayZEPwHNaV

Website (and more): @Kajabi  Kajabi makes my life very easy.  It bundles my website, landing pages, email provider, forms, customer CRM, and courses together.  It's truly a great tool for the cost.  Cost: $399/month  https://t.co/v5PJHSRiGa
@matt_gray_ Gonna review these if I want to run one. Thanks for sharing brother.
My one-person business does $169k/mo in revenue.  It costs me $623/mo + 2.9% to run it.  Here are the 11 no-code tools in my tech stack:  🧵
@schlaf LMK if Jennifer and I can be helpful in any way, man. We're around (if you're in HV)
@remotejoeclark True story.
@mustafa_kamal Bummer!
@natolisnuggets Nice :)
Shout out to all the solopreneurs that had enough courage to try their own thing against the advice of their very worried parents.
@nathanbaugh27 This is really dope. Thanks for sharing!
@deadcoder0904 It's also the fastest way to hating yourself.
@JoshArras @blakeaburge Smart advice!
The best solopreneurs: - High income - Moderate expenses - Simplistic business model - Zero unwanted obligations - Generous amount of creative time
@deysonortiz @Artlist_io Awesome!
@ericasmyname @Ritu_Jhajharia @MeetKevon @dagorenouf Your writing is excellent, Erica. Just thought I would pass that note along. I lurk, but I follow.
@torreydawley Thank you, Torrey. Trying.
@HellloHar It's up in the air right now.
@AlexCookThinks It's never black and white, but people sell it that way.
@tspeeg Thanks for reinforcing that I've made a good choice, Tyler.
@SachinRamje I like that, Sachin!
@theficouple Exactly. What would my mother think, is the lens I push things through.
@girish1729 I do. That's why I choose not to be an asshole.
@YotisTonnelier I agree. I see all of this happening in real time on Twitter and it's so easy to see. But others fall victim.
@CSMikeCardona My man 🔥
@natolisnuggets This business model never seems to be worth the energy, IMO.
I could build a much bigger online business by being divisive as hell, separating supporters into a group, and then selling them things that reinforce their feelings, but I'd rather make less and sleep peacefully.
@tomosman Appreciate you, Tom!

@Ryan_Invests Write above the fold like you might a Thread.
@pbteja1998 Congratulations! Just keep going.

@callmehouck Lol. Now THAT is funny.
Today I messed around and searched back to Naval's 2013 Tweets, and I can confirm that we all start off just trying to figure this app out.
@MyLearningNotes @heyjoeyjustice @Tim_Denning @thedankoe Thanks, fellas.
@francesco_srv I tend to agree.  But to help others, you have to win first (as you stated).

@matt_gray_ All of the positives here require action, which is why they work!
@FitFounder Such is life.
@grant_melson @ShaanVP Ahh gotcha, I misunderstood. Makes sense :)
@grant_melson I'm not sure what that means.
@FitFounder I agree. The energy is wonderful.  However, I've also never seen it more divisive.  There's a lot of silly little kids with no life experience on here.
@brianondrako It's so good that you did.  Most of us start that way. Victims in everything.  Some people wake up and realize they have one life and it's time to get moving.
@AndreiCioloca Most big creators don't buy RTs.   They support one another.
@FitFounder Great comment, Dan.
@chris_gensheer Great teaching, Chris. Your kids will grow up well...
@SachinRamje Love it, Sachin.
@TheCoolestCool This is a great take.  People yell, "But X is unfair!"  Ok. Now what?   Either become an advocate for change or understand the rules and play. We need both people, but in-between doesn't do anything.
@abrahamcslls Great idea :)
@tomosman Thank you, Tom.
@alexgarcia_atx I used to read the news. Then, after awhile, I realized that it was all a big game.   So I stopped reading it and started playing it.  But no books. Any recs?
@SahilBloom Yep.  There is so much out of our control that we can do very little about, and most people are focused 100% on these things. Not gonna help.
@VisionAndSales I love this.
@thestorystylist The rules are pretty clear. The work is the difficult part.
@alexgarcia_atx 100%, Alex. It's up to you.
Every unsuccessful person I know believes the game is rigged.  Every successful person knows the game is rigged and learns how to play.  It's cliché as hell, but your mindset is everything.
@EdLatimore Congrats my man ♥️
@louisnicholls_ Roma Norte/Condesa is my fave.
@CSMikeCardona @Jayyanginspires @readtechnically @Julian @stephsmithio Thanks man!
@tariquesha1 Thank you!
@SahilBloom Congrats man!
@Nicolascole77 Dishoom was wonderful. In fact, all Indian food I are was great.   We went and saw Mary Poppins (even though I didn't want to) but I ended up enjoying the heck out of it.   Have a pint of real ale. Go to some great cemeteries!
@pmthn Even as a Buckeye I felt bad. Good kid, great runner, looked painful.
@peterdbaron Thanks, Peter!
@SahilBloom 100% man. That's how it's done...
@FitFounder Haha. Too much!
@matt_gray_ Love me some Super. Beautiful sites!
@EdLatimore I've watched so many political news "gurus" on both sides twisting the facts so drastically to rile up their followers.  Why? Because they are incentivized.  It's not just the mass media anymore. Everyone is lying for personal gain.
@katairobi @mkobach @jackbutcher @amandanat @KateBour @Aazarshad Thanks, Robert!
@DanBenoni Love that, Dan. This is the formula for success. A good balance is necessary.
@barrettjoneill It isn't too shabby.  FYI - not forgetting our chat. Getting through the Holidays, interviewing some website vendors, and then will be ready to jam at some point.
@jasonstrimpel Appreciate you, brother. Let's jam out on Zoom once the holidays are over.
@Jabuto_Jabuto Thanks, Jábuto!
@blakeaburge Thank you sir.
@SystemSunday It's probably my most prized possession!
@heychazza 100%
@BlackLabelAdvsr Thank you's from other people (and lambos)
@EdLatimore Everyone talks about how the mass media is incentivized to lie.  So are all of your favorite alternative news gurus on social media.  We've just switched to a different group of liars.
@FitFounder I eat one McDonalds burger like every decade.  It's delicious and anyone who tells you it isn't is lying.   But I haven't had a regular soda in probably 20 years.
@alexgarcia_atx The best. The true difference makers.
@ChaseAHappyLife Tough to lose :)
@soumyarai07 Just keep going.
@torreydawley Super addicting, Torrey.   One of my faves.
I've found that a great measure of personal success is how many people thank you for theirs.
@heyeaslo Thanks for the shout, my man.  You're doing great work here (and on Instagram).  Keep up the excellent work 📈
@peperbra @dickiebush @OneJKMolina @Nicolascole77 @ItsKieranDrew @WrongsToWrite @GrammarHippy @Alexmathers84 Thank you!
@ThomasLK2020 Good luck!
@JOTA_uy @jamesreaco The question isn't "How many people did this work for?"  It's "How many people didn't this work for?"
Quitting your job to work full-time on something that has $0 in revenue sounds great in the movies, but in theory, you'll probably regret that decision.  It's much easier to walk a tightrope with a safety net underneath.
@KateBour I get pissed off when I meet my business heroes and they suck as people.
@SystemSunday You're a worthy follow anywhere, Ben.
@Nicolascole77 Swanky, Cole.
@FitFounder True story. No 6-pack here, but feeling damn good.
@patrigsby Love to hear that...
@SahilBloom @blakeaburge He's got a killer following and it's been fun experimenting with a bunch of stuff with him.
@FitFounder @blakeaburge See you there, brother.
@thejoshuageelen Awesome, thanks Joshua.
@JohnpaulBened09 See you tomorrow.
@foundersuccess See ya there.
@Joseph__Seifert Thanks. I'm trying to do more of them because people seem to dig them.

@chris_gensheer @joserosado I'd argue Gary Vee drove familiarity around his personality and approach moreso than his topic.   But it's an interesting point for sure.  Other people are just early. He could be one of them.
@coachmontel Thanks!
@Bgpokerrant @joserosado Content.
@Emilio_emb If you truly love something, you're always learning something new.  So the topic can stay similar, but the knowledge can change.   My two cents, at least.
@joserosado I'd bet if you go back in time he started more targeted and became broader. But he could also just be a highly effective outlier.
@IntegrowSales Probably one of the best examples.  We watch the same shows because we're familiar with the characters.
@Joseph__Seifert Thanks. I'm just some random dumbass on the internet though.
@joserosado I think people want to be "interesting" therefore they talk about 30 different things.  But then you're never familiar.
If you write to your audience about the same topic every day, you don't become boring.  You become familiar.   And people are attracted to what they are familiar with.
@SamuelSzuchan @itsNickPayne Thanks, Sam!
@arvidkahl Taking a 2-hour lunch with my wife.
@PEfund_guy Agreed. Doing is learning!
@heyjoeyjustice Haha. :)
@Joseph__Seifert Tweet about it and ask people what they need help with. Get on the phone with them and find out exactly what would resonate.
@chris_samps Thanks! I felt like it was basic advice but it seems to resonate like hell.
@EvolvedMindset_ Great quote from a great writer.
@theantonioreza Absolutely.
@chrisshippPT Literally anything.
@Zbijelic Get after it, fail, learn, try again.
If you're thinking about starting your own business, you don't need another Twitter thread or blog post.  Just start.  You'll learn 100x more by falling on your face than by reading someone else's advice.
@OneJKMolina This is very good advice.
@cryptolad1256 Haha :) Thanks!
@blakeaburge @jayclouse Loom + Pitch + a lot of swearing when I messed up.
@cryptolad1256 GMI
@LuxNarayan These hit the hardest every week for me.
@FitFounder Heck yeah. Glad it was helpful!@
@PEfund_guy There are plenty of problems, I can promise you that.
@SahilBloom It's tougher than it looks, but after a few months of figuring out what not to spend time on, it's a winning formula.
@jayclouse Welcome :)
@theleoalexandru Thanks!
@jjtalentcoach For sure.   Every yes to someone else is a no to my wife.
@jasonstrimpel Congrats on the official!
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
And my normal day ends up looking like this:  - 7:15a to 8:15a: Interact on social media for 60 minutes - 9:00a to 10:30a: Go to the gym with my wife - 11:00a to 1:00p: Eat lunch &amp; write - 1p to 4:00p: Creative time
What's left?  Once I'm through these questions, there are 4 non-negotiable pieces of work that end up on my calendar:  - Interact on social media for 45 minutes with my audience - Go to the gym for 90 minutes - Write for 90 minutes - Attend client calls
What can I delegate?  Delegate any work that is leftover, that is less valuable than the time it would take you to do.  Delegate to a VA (or someone on Upwork) using process documents &amp; videos that show them exactly what to do.  Here's my process:   https://t.co/RY5XsPt4yT
What can I automate?  Next, I look for places to insert automation.  An example is my coaching business.   I used to have an elaborate back-and-forth to onboard clients.  Now I use Kajabi + Zapier + Airtable.  “Can this be automated?”  Yes: Automate No: Move to next question
What can I simplify?  Look for simpler processes or a reduced  scope of work.  Like my digital course.   I could have made it an elaborate production, but instead, I recorded videos in one take with no editing.  “Can this be simplified?”  Yes: Simplify No: Move to next question
What can I eliminate?  Each week I find:  - Upcoming meetings I shouldn't have booked - Podcasts I don't need to be on  - Favors that aren't urgent - And more  I simply ask myself:   "Does this move me closer to my most important goals?"  No: Eliminate Yes: Move to next question
If you replicate this simple process, you'll:  - Eliminate context switching - Reduce the risk of burnout  - Improve your focus  Plus, you'll dramatically increase the time you spend working on the most important parts of your business  Here are the 4 questions I ask:
How to save yourself 40 hours of unimportant work this month:
@joserosado @JoshuaLisec @dvassallo @EdLatimore Thanks, man!
@chris_gensheer Thanks, Chris!
@macmagx Would love to see it. Appreciate it! 🔥
@macmagx Yep, definitely in play in the future. Thanks!  Will likely transition in 2023 + 2024, but super top of funnel focused for long game action.  1M+ followers and 150,000+ subs then some interesting changes coming.   Appreciate it, Mac!
@macmagx To be clear, I'm not opposed to business improvement. I love growing.  It's that I get a bunch of people who email me telling me how I could grow a big team or build a community and 10x.  But, I'm just interested in that.  Ok - spill the beans on
@arvidkahl Testimonial is one of my favorite softwares. Changed my business.
@davidshestrin @blakeaburge He made it publishing one thread. Give it a read on Saturday and see if you can steal some lessons.
@Zbijelic @blakeaburge Heck yeah. Thanks, Zlatko!
@raymond_green @blakeaburge You're a lot like Blake. You're open to suggestions, and take action.  It's easy and fun working with fellas like you.
@jasonstrimpel @blakeaburge I very much appreciate him being open to it.
@blakeaburge Thanks for being an awesome person to work with. I love when people just take action, my friend.
@sweatystartup @blakeaburge Thank you :)
If you're interested in getting the recap, make sure you're part of my newsletter here.  You can read it in 2.5 minutes.   https://t.co/X3l2wg6fme
Here's the high-level summary:  1. Simplified the sales process. 2. Made valuable free things affordable, but paid. 3. Passively suggested people buy them.  The result was a massive increase over his previous process.
Last week, I spent 30 minutes chatting with @blakeaburge about his business.  In the next 48 hours, he made $2,243 online.  Just drafted up a recap of our conversation and will be sending it out this Saturday.

@SamZanto This is the reason I love it, Sam.
@markstrefford I certainly wouldn't
@howiesommerfeld Thanks, Howie!
@torreydawley Same :)
@byhazellim Totally. This is the true for sure, Hazel.
@FitFounder 100%.   It's a time:revenue ratio I keep my eye on.
People often reach out to me and say things like, "you could scale 10x if you just..." without realizing that I'm not interested in scaling 10x.  A great lifestyle business is a perfect balance of quality time &amp; quality revenue.  Don't get distracted by other people's purpose.
@thedankoe So true.  MBA is a perfect example.   Someone who just graduated with an MBA knows significantly less about business than a HS dropout with a thriving business.
@matt_gray_ Walking after meals is big for me. 15 min after dinner is my new thing.
@blakeaburge The template library is coming together nicely!
@agazdecki And the last day of the quarter comes around faster than you think (especially as a CRO).
@FitFounder Every social media platform is as good as your ability to curate what you get.
@thedankoe You will experience all of the emotions whether you are striving for greatness or doing literally nothing. Might as well go on the journey with the more enticing outcome.
@jjeffrose Thanks for the nice mention, Jeff!
@realwesfoster That's correct.
@tspeeg Everyone is an impostor until they aren't.  Then they hit a new level of growth and learning and it comes back again.  Good news is that you can use it as fuel to get even better!
@SWComposer Every time you hit a new growth area, it creeps back. It's a good thing though, not a bad one.
@Nicolascole77 True story, Cole.
@FitFounder It's comforting knowing that some of the best of the best doubt themselves, Dan.
@dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Oh, man. This looks dope.   Going to buy it when it comes out. 💰
@talktoterryco @DanNelken Correct. I've never met a mediocre performer with impostor syndrome.
@randomrecruiter I recommend the exact same thing.
@SahilBloom @AdamMGrant That Adam Grant is a smart guy. Love that reframe.
@natolisnuggets Yep. I've never met a mediocre performer with impostor syndrome.
@tomosman One of the most freeing realizations I've had, Tom.
The best way to deal with impostor syndrome is to realize nearly everyone is an impostor.
@arvidkahl I’m about to mute myself.
@JoshMcKain I threw that in years ago.
@KarolyneHahn Watch me.
@imrancader_ I’m pretty sure I’ll be alright.
@barrettjoneill I’m Tweeting this from a spa. About to get a 60 min massage while everyone else is yelling about someone named SBF.
@Yannick_Veys It’s not even that I’m ignoring “him” per se. I just don’t care about the whole saga.   It’s a soap opera I’m not interested in.
@RealEstateMaxi Apparently very easily.
@CSMikeCardona Stealing.
@Yannick_Veys I don’t understand it because I don’t pay attention.
My productivity hack is ignoring everything related to Elon Musk and crypto.
@SullyBusiness Making money is hard as can be.   But the actual path is more simple than most people think.   It’s just often overcomplicated by people who need you to feel confused in order to buy their products.
@Jason_Kovalenko I’ve written a ton of free articles about that. You might find them helpful.    https://t.co/LJYGj6Y9gb
@ChrisTaudien @TobiasE97319503 @dvassallo I’m certainly not the first person to build a one person business but I think solopreneur was a word I chose to claim early and it’s gotten significantly more popular since. I’m happy it has.
@CassandraLRosen A few ways:  1. Tactical products: literally watch then do.   2. Create a unique solution: my content os is a system I created that is uniquely different.   3.  Market them differently: short, affordable, accessible, meant to be enjoyed b
@ericasmyname This made me laugh so hard. Thank you :)
@cnu Good call.
@LeadAuthentic Write about it on social media.
@gid_dev An intersection of what you care about, what you know a lot about, and what a bunch of people want to know a lot about...  That sounds like a good start.
@CSMikeCardona On the money, Mike.
@SahilBloom @AlFaslivingroom This 👆🏻
How to think of an idea:  1) Think of a product (very challenging)  2) Solve your own problem (an easier way)  3) Create unique content that lets you own a micro-topic with very limited competition. Then, listen for problems from your audience. (IMO, the best way)
@jackbutcher @visualizevalue Looks excellent, man.  Congrats.
@Nicolascole77 Wow. Looks incredible.
@cpatrascudev @nielsmouthaan @dailytimeapp I used @paritydeals - it works great
@AugmentAllWays Thank you!
@sabrinassantiag Read, write, draw, listen to comedy, etc.
@AlFaslivingroom @SahilBloom Those few adjustments are usually key though :)
@dickiebush This is basically how to get good at anything. Such a valuable Tweet, Dickie!
@ItsKieranDrew The joke is on those people though. It might get you followers, but it won't get you customers.
@KateBour When you learn to compete with your prior self, you find yourself in a pretty intense dogfight every day. That's how you grow.
@EdLatimore I do the same, but find 2 opposing viewpoints. Best way to get a true gauge of what's true and what isn't. It requires you to actually think!
@SystemSunday The best start to a morning routine is a good night's sleep.
@chris_gensheer Definitely a heckuva good start.  But at some point you'll have to answer the question, "Why Chris's business?"
@SahilBloom And do it in a way that is both different, but also uniquely yours. The more the solution and business scream "Justin" the more people seem to enjoy it. Bring your own style.
@MyLearningNotes 100%, Justin. That's how it's done.
@thehowietan Exactly, Howie.
@darentsmith Wow. Great comment, Daren. I love that approach.
If your business solves the same problem as everyone else, has the same solution as everyone else, and uses the same language as everyone else, then you're a commodity.   Find a non-obvious solution to an obvious problem and you'll win more business at a better price point.
@ppcClickShark I don't think lead magnets are bad at all.  I just see so many people using LM + complicated email funnels to position at $29 product.  It's like "dude, just offer the product at that price point."
@ScottWissing I don't think lead magnets are bad. I just don't need multiple lead magnets and big email funnels to sell something that is $50.
@NewPrediction I just talk about the problem I solve every day and then tell people that they can go to my website to learn how to solve it. I have free things they can read, no email address needed, and they can purchase products if they want more help. 
@happyfridavid Anything less than $200.
@TheIndependentU So much. Just solve people's problems and position a high-quality product at the right time.
It's amazing how many people create free lead magnets and complicated email funnels to sell an inexpensive product because they think that's what you're supposed to do.  If your product is affordable, just write content and then position it for people to buy when they are ready.
@byhazellim Great point, Hazel.
@TMitrosilis Great stuff here, Teddy. Process focused is so important. That will often yield the outcome you're looking fort.
@yishaiback Sometimes it's just the last person standing that wins.
@FitFounder Perfect analogy, Dan.
@AhmedSaeedBJ Yep. Look to compound. That's the real power.
@TomScourfield1 Way more time. And it doesn't work.
@thealexjjohnson Never been so true.
People fail to build a meaningful business because they are impatient.  There are zero get-rich-quick schemes that work.  If someone is selling you that and you're buying? You're the fool.  Building something great takes a long time, so please approach it with that mindset.
@dvassallo 😂
@dvassallo My wife ran the lunch program at the startup we met at.   Every employee’s first day: “Free lunch? Awesome!”  6 months later: “I’ll only eat organic Irish butter from grass fed cows on my filet. Order that moving forward.”  This is not a joke.
@AngryTomtweets @thatroblennon @thesyedhuq @francis_oleh @albadawee @jonbrosio @Copywriting_Dad @waronweakness @WrongsToWrite @ItsKieranDrew @joserosado @dickiebush Thank you!
@agazdecki “The pet rock WAS a great idea…”
@blakeaburge Simplicity wins. Every single time.
@EdLatimore I also get frustrated by people who think using an "outlier" mentality.  They find the biggest outlier available in a situation and then use it to combat practical advice.
@lincolnpolson @thedankoe @writingtoriches Thank you!
@dennis_geelen @InspiredByWayne So happy it was worthwhile for you, Dennis!
@ppcClickShark I don't even get that complicated, tbh.  Often, it's when they finish a certain action in one of my products that I recommend another product related to that specific section.
@torreydawley @JoshMiles @EdLatimore @micsolana @amandanat @ISO50 @balajis @foundmyfitness @ZubyMusic @FitFounder @caroljsroth @zachhomol_ Thank you!
@seempaq 100%.   It's a win/win when you stop thinking about "how can I make more money?" and start thinking about "how can I get this customer closer to their ultimate goal?"
@ItsKieranDrew It's amazing when you think you understand something, only to find out you can't write about it clearly.  Time to learn more about that thing.
@FitFounder Alcohol → H2O
@thedankoe It's also one of the best ways to stay focused on creating an intentional life.  The moment you hire someone, you become a manager of people. After managing thousands of people in my career, I don't want to go back at this time in my life.
@TheSuddenWealth Awesome. I love hearing that, Jacob!
@Fahimbinreza1 I don't. I offer them products along the journey that I think will be helpful at that specific time.  They get to make the choice.
@foundersuccess Thanks so much, Marcus!
@blakeaburge Remains true to this day.
@SahilBloom Exactly. It's not just "I made more money".   It's, "this impacted my customer in such a good way that the natural outcome is additional revenue over time."
I went from running a mediocre business to a successful one when I began maximizing customer lifetime value.  I didn't add random upsells.  I started offering more of the right products to the right people at the right time in their journey.  Happier customers, better business.
@agazdecki @elonmusk @acquiredotcom @acquire Get this man his handle!
@thePhilRivers @pauldm Not necessarily. Some people write really long newsletters that are excellent.   But many people write long newsletters that could have been 80% shorter.
@pauldm I've read newsletters that are too long, but never one that is too short.   Just something to think about no matter where you end up.   (also not suggesting long newsletters are bad - they can be great for certain topics/writing styles)
@BenjaminPutano I drove through Cincy on my way to my new place in NY.   This place was awesome. Insane burgers.    https://t.co/3LbHoqbMiW
@schlaf Want to chat about this when you get back upstate?
@MrPassive_ Yep. Done over a long period of time.
@jdhawl That's how a great mentor should act.
@thehowietan Exactly, Howie.
@PaulineRiviere Such a huge game changer, Pauline.
@barrettjoneill Very mythical. The perfect thing has usually been imperfect for a long time.
@natolisnuggets A very real thing.
@AuthorOnTheSide 100% it's underrated.
@blakeaburge Just keep trying things. When something finally works, do more of it.
@blakeaburge My new Saturday morning money sheet 📈
In business, it's rarely picking the right mentor, software, course, or community that makes the biggest difference.  It's usually just action, analysis, and iteration.  If you're procrastinating, waiting for "perfect",  just push something out today and let the ride begin.
@sultanofcopy Thank you!
@NotechAna Love that
@TMitrosilis Exactly
@PEfund_guy Correct
@chris_gensheer Congrats, Chris!
The internet is like a convention where anyone can be a speaker.  1% of people grab the mic, 9% of people actively listen, and 90% of people mill around talking shit about those on stage.  But, the stage is where the good stuff happens.  So,  grab the mic and start talking.

@RyanJonesSEO Thank you so much, Ryan. I appreciate you giving me a bit of your time on the weekend.
@blakeaburge Haha. I'm definitely going to use that moving forward. That's such a great comment, Blake.
@igorbenic I appreciate it, Igor. Love to hear it.
@FitFounder Thank you, Dan! I appreciate that, man. 🔥
@darentsmith Dude, that's awesome. You'd better share.
@foundersuccess So appreciative, man. Thank you.
@imjardi Thanks for reading it!
@PEfund_guy It's a pretty simple process that most people don't think about, IMO.
@SahilBloom Thank you, man. Looking fwd to sharing it.
Last year, I figured out that I could spend $40.93 and 10 minutes of my time to predictably generate $7,500 in sales.  It's revenue most people already have on their computer.  Tomorrow's newsletter breaks down the whole process.  Join 59,774 subscribers:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
@mattragland @sweatystartup New profile pic is dope, Matt!   Btw - you gotta get up here to Hudson Valley. You would dig this place. Great brews and tremendous hikes.
@tomosman Seeing all of the different ways to monetize things I'm already doing.
@joshdviner 100%, Josh. These are legit
@thesamparr @awilkinson Go for a seaplane tour. Here's a shot from mine:  https://t.co/AmnnqPKakL
@sweatystartup Go to Burial Beer. Wonderful stuff.
@Nicolascole77 It is.  With 1,000 true fans you can make a living almost 100% of the time.
@realwesfoster They are really hard to keep up in the long term. And you can't necessarily add more without exhausting yourself.  For example, increasing any of the numbers would be killer.
If you want go deeper on this subject, check out my article:  "4 Steps to 1,000 True Fans"   https://t.co/CB3IDOYpgW
TL;DR  1. Think like a niche "streaming service"  2. Become a Category Pirate  3. Tell a story worth following  4. Do unscalable things
Do unscalable things:  Here are some of the things I've done:  - Published daily to social media, often 2x-3x per day.  - Replied to every comment, every morning for over an hour.  - Engaged with 15+ people's content every morning for over 3 years.
Tell a story worth following:  Like the founder of a  company, you need a story that compels your audience.  The story can't be fake. It's your real story but stitched together in a fashion that makes it exciting to follow along.  Use this formula:  https://t.co/36gGZJG8un
- What is something everyone believes to be true, that you don't?  - What is something nobody in your niche is talking about, but should be?  - What are the biggest mistakes people are making, that they are oblivious to?  - Why are you someone worth follo
Become a Category Pirate:  Don't blend in. Stand out.  And the easiest way to stand out is through non-obvious content.   Non-obvious content is about bringing a new thought process to your niche.   Something that makes you radically different.   Ask yourself these questions ↓
Think Like a Niche Streaming Service:  It's critical that you focus on helping a specific person looking for specific advice.  The more helpful your content is to a specific audience, the more likely they are to find your "signal" in a world of generic "noise".  Stay narrow.
4 steps to 1,000 true fans on Twitter:
@dickiebush Question #3 is one of my favorites. Whatever channel that is, double down.
@KateBour I have with some, like Microacquire and Groundswell, because I really like Andrew Gazdecki and Brendan Short.  Some people want to stay in stealth.  Others are through a fund, and then some others completely offline :)
@verocopyco  https://t.co/QyCsgRpLQO
@chris_samps @matt_gray_ Matt and I know each other quite well.
@bryhutch I don't care about going viral.  I care about going deep with the people who I want to attract.
@TomBeemSays That's awesome to hear because it's my goal.  I always try and write as though I'm speaking to one person.  Appreciate you saying it!
@polak_jasper Great stuff, Jasper.  Thanks for the kind mention!
@ItsKieranDrew Really good question.  I'd say write more, publish more, and move faster.  I started slow because I was afraid, like so many people. But the answer lies in the feedback, not the fear.
@FitFounder Yep. And the people who aren't along for the ride?  That's ok too.
@matt_gray_ Yep. Each little post is your knowledge marching out into the universe to teach people and make people aware that you exist. Wild.
@MylesMarino1 Look at this mess.  https://t.co/m7j52I4Kij
@nerita_ll Nice!
@Zbijelic That's awesome. I love getting those little notes.
@matt_gray_ Good stuff, Matt.  Take care of yourself. Because nothing else matters if you don't.
@chris_gensheer Yes sir. Started in late 2018.  Time flies :)
@craigshoemaker Thanks, Craig!
@PEfund_guy I never post and ghost in the AM. Maybe sometimes in the PM.
@SeanPHogue Love to hear it, Sean.
@gregisenberg I love that way of thinking of it, Greg.
@CSMikeCardona Haha. Thanks.  I don't even know what being a guru means, I just know if people put it in quotes when referring to you, it's probably nothing nice.
@blakeaburge Love it, Blake. Keep going, brother.
4 years ago, I pressed publish on my first piece of content.  Since then I've met incredible people, invested $100k+ in friends, &amp; closed $3M in business.  To this day, I have no idea what each piece of content will do, but I publish knowing the vast upside.  I hope you will too.
@jayclouse I like to build new things that I get excited about. So I sort of wait until I'm excited about something, and then I build it.
@jayclouse 55% of my revenue comes from a product I built almost 18 months ago.  It just keeps selling. Pretty interesting, huh?
@JoeydeWit_ That's a great quote.
@MindOfVilla Tons. Is there a specific question I could help answer?
@byhazellim Nailed it.
@UnderstoryBard Sure is.
@Joseph__Seifert I quit my job to start writing on social media :)
You won't build a great business without a little risk.  Those at the top of their fields nearly always took some small risks.  - The idea - The execution - The go-to-market - The advertising plan  Don't be catastrophically foolish.  But take some well-calculated chances.
@jarrylew Maybe that's true, but it's not my job to decide who can and who can't, so people should try if they want to become one.
@ishverduzco @wes_kao @thedankoe @ericasmyname @KateBour @matt_gray_ @ccmarce_writes @jspujji @ShaanVP @SahilBloom @Codie_Sanchez @dickiebush @TrungTPhan Thanks for the shout, brother!
@sweatystartup Thanks man!
@tillwaytweets Weird. Haven't heard of that problem as of yet!
@nathanbaugh27 Same!
@alukerowley Maybe 15 minutes or so? I use inspiration from other great writers to learn faser.
@JamesonCamp @WatkinsTBen Thank you, fellas. So glad you were pleased. Makes my day 🔥

4 phases of Solopreneurship:  Phase 1: Get paid to grow professional skills  Phase 2: Use those skills to solve work problems  Phase 3: Monetize those skills on the side  Phase 4: Use the earnings to go on your own  Accumulate. Internalize. Externalize. Leave.
@theandreboso Correct.  It's much easier to walk the wire when you have a safety net.
@OneJKMolina I like Lo-Fi + wine.
@blakeaburge Snagging it now. Nice release man :)  Congrats on the 100lb lost!
@iam_Riichard @jessedanyusufco Nobody is reading them now.
@darentsmith I very much appreciate that man.  If it makes anyone feel better, I worry that I'm not adding value every single time I hit "Post".   But, it usually works out. Keep posting :)
@darentsmith Heck yeah, Daren. Glad this could be helpful.
@SahilBloom @blakeaburge  https://t.co/ob6OvzarZr
@FitFounder 100%. The hook is so much easier after writing the body copy.
@TomatoTEEJ I write at the intersection of what I know about, what I care about, and what my audience wants more of.
@SahilBloom Oh, stop Mr. #1.
@blakeaburge Oh, shit. Haha 😂
@Richard_andey You're welcome, Andrew!
@dennis_geelen Thank you, Dennis!
@ihteshamit Let's do it.
@ThatMarket3r Let's hope so :)
@gabriellefrieda Thank you :)
@Joseph__Seifert They definitely are.
@jessedanyusufco Kept going, honestly.  I just had to lose my ego.
@PEfund_guy Thanks!
@matt_gray_ Heck yes on surrounding yourself with optimists.  Nah on the cold shower. Gimme the heat!
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
TL;DR  Step 1: Write the body using headers and white space  Step 2: Use a specific call to action to tell readers what to do.  Step 3: Write compelling hook lines by using my recommendations.
Use past vs. present to compare change:  (Again, using #'s help)
Use eye-catching numbers to share an accomplishment:
Tell people what they'll get, &amp; address a common objection:
Finish your writing process by creating your Hook Tweet:  We're at the last, but most important step of writing Tweet threads.  The "Hook".  Without a good hook, nobody stops to read, engage, comment or Retweet. Ouch.  Here are 3 (of several) hooks that work for me:
Tell the reader exactly what they should do:  - Follow you - Join your email list - Retweet the first Tweet - Read another thread you wrote - Buy a product that is relevant to the thread  Here's an example of how I usually end my threads:  https://t.co/XfSKZtFJt7
Write out the call-to-action next:  So many people write good threads and then forget to tell the reader what to do at the end.   This is missed opportunity to drive reader action.  Think about the possible actions you want at the conclusion of your thread and then...
Each "body" Tweet should:  - Have a header - Include enough white space to make it easy to read  A header simply tells the reader what to expect in the Tweet they are reading.  White space is the space between lines so that it's easier on the eyes.  Here's an example of both:  https://t.co/0rkeSrCSef
Start by writing the body:  The body of the thread is the information you're attempting to convey.  If you're not sharing anything of value, even the best "hook" won't get people to engage, comment, and Retweet.  Scrolling a thread is tiring, so the format is everything.
Here are the biggest mistakes I see:  - Lacking a good “Hook Tweet”. - No "headers" on the "body" Tweets. - Way too wordy, and no white space for reading. - No clear call-to-action or call-to-conversation at the end.  Let's fix that.
Writing high-quality Twitter threads is the fastest &amp; easiest way to pick up followers who are interested in your expertise.   That leads to more email subscribers &amp; customers.  Unfortunately, most people don't have a writing process for threads, so they make common mistakes.
I'm the 7th most-saved Thread writer of all-time on Readwise.  My threads have been read 98M+ times, and led to 224k+ new followers.  Here's my entire writing process in &lt; 2.5 minutes:
@joserosado Great thread, Jose.  Tons of useful information here. Thanks for shouting out my landing page as well.   Appreciate it.
@AmandaMGoetz Super lame.  I deal with this on LinkedIn every single day and often it's from folks with decent followings.   At least change a word for goodness sake 😂
@kylesporter I don't do much heat mapping honestly.  I look at visitor to conversion mostly, which probably isn't perfect, but a decent proxy.
@recostseg 🙌
@helloeugenio 37
@blakeaburge Dude, this looks awesome. Congrats!
@thatartem There are always ways to get involved with something, in some way, that do not involve capital.
@imjardi I love this prompt.
@wroughtedvalue Thank you.
@ItsKieranDrew Beautiful comment, Kieran.
@recostseg Probably a silly question, but is this for commercial real estate only or can you use this for residential real estate?
In life, if you are fortunate enough to know exactly what you want to do, then just start doing it.   There's no better way to reach mastery of something than by living it as early as possible.
@andrewglynch @danieldessinger Yeah. 2.9% + $.30 to Stripe and then some software for my website, newsletter, etc.
@KurtisHanni Great stuff, Kurtis.   This is something I've been obsessed with for a long time.
@FitFounder Damn. Good point, Dan.
@bewritethere I hope so, Pranshu.
@OmarMakfinance Definitely. That's a given.
@digital_didact For sure.
@sean_deloughery Yep. Great question to ask yourself:  "Why did I buy this?"
@thejacobshipley Yep!
@SeanPHogue I'm always tinkering with mine, Sean.
This is just one way to write better landing page copy.  Want a few more?  Here's a short guide to building better landing pages for your business.  You can read it in less than 4 minutes and apply it instantly.  I hope you enjoy it.   https://t.co/MrFFMdJG6G
Here's a better example:   "Learn how to make your first stock market investment in just 10 minutes (with zero fees)"  - What: Make their first stock market investment - How long: 10 minutes - Objection handler: With zero fees.  I 100% understand what I'm getting here.
Let's start with a bad example:   "Learn how to invest in the stock market."  This outcome is pretty nebulous.   - How much? - How many? - Can anyone do it? - How long will it take?  Those questions are unanswered, plus I have a million objections.
A great landing page is critical to generating revenue.  The problem?  Most people stink at writing them.  Here are 2 quick examples that might help:
@danieldessinger 3M * 94% margins = $2.82M
@jackbutcher Can confirm. More attempts for me, but each one very simple.
@klauscallum0g @ishverduzco You realize that they need to prove their identity, right? The way you described it is not how it works.
@eidlisz_ben @ishverduzco Having my driver's license.
@SullyOmarr @ishverduzco Having my driver's license.
@billyfrazr Excellent GIF. Well done.
@findmyke That's what I did first. And I would do it again that way.  Contrary to popular belief, I didn't come out of the womb with LinkedIn followers.  I wrote daily for 9 months to grow it.
@MarketingCaddy @SaveToNotion I think so too, Walt.
@ecomchasedimond Thank you, my man.
@VncentIkechukwu  https://t.co/64c9clrgk7
@ishverduzco Same here, man!
@thealexbanks Thank you, my man!
@JoshMcKain I was still employed, yes. I started writing about 9 months before I left my job.
@Hunckler Thank you, Matt!
@wes_kao I appreciate that, Wes!
@thedankoe Appreciate you, Dan.
@Nicolascole77 Thank you, my man.
@TMitrosilis Thank you, my man. Almost done with The Second Mountain! Moved to audiobook at the gym.  Might be my all-time favorite.
@OmarMakfinance @EdLatimore Knowledge is a commodity.   Motivation + action is power.
@Tereza_Finance 10 months.
@jspector @amandanat @theKevinShen You're an awesome interviewer and your newsletter is one of VERY few that I allow into my inbox. It's so short, but so good.
@tambuildsthings Just something new each day. I had zero processes at that point.
@TeamApocalyps16 Yes.
@SahilBloom I love when that happens. My best replies always become my best Tweets.
@timgabedesign Not yet. The move got in the way. It's still planned though.
@AlexAndBooks_ Thank you, my man :)
@EastCoastJoe I just pony up and pay, unfortunately.
@KateBour @o0Aditi0o @randfish @amandanat @TheCoolestCool @ThatChristinaG @Dmurr68 @Aazarshad Thank you, Katelyn.  In a period of great anger and vitriol, niceness still works.   I promise :)
@theroborourke I have a part-time VA that works 20 hours per month.
@Lifeon1Page Former CRO.
@akashsaha__ Total.
@alekzan I didn't mean I quit building SaaS. I mean, I no longer advise SaaS companies.
@christiancollrd @FitFounder It is! The Kerhonkson Rail Trail.
@agazdecki Help people win personally, and they will help you win professionally.
@ItsKieranDrew Mastery of a revenue generating skill means never being out of the game.
@SahilBloom Yep. Feeling this.  https://t.co/fHVxQZl88E
@FitFounder Last week for me.  https://t.co/oFsffYN7ZM
@ishverduzco I will pay so that the 120+ impostors I've had to report over the last year are finally a thing of the past.
@EdLatimore My favorite way to learn is to experience something myself, fail miserably, and then go to people who have done it with specific questions.   It keeps me from asking vague questions like "How do you do this?"
@thesamparr Goodness. Congratulations, Sam.   That's some serious ear-time.
@SievaKozinsky Looking at it another way, most people will fail because they never try.
@dickiebush @Nicolascole77 You should talk about how you build your content schedule.   Always interested in how other folks do it.
@Nicolascole77 As someone trying to get through this process, this is super helpful. Thanks man!

@NicheDown That's a great thought, Mike...I might do that.
@farez One at a time, but continue shipping and bolting on.
@CicmilJovan It depends. Sometimes 20. Sometimes 70.  But, I'd say on average I try to work about 5-6 hours per day.
@jayclouse Thank you, Jay. As are you. I think your content is A+
@bartek_matoga Outside of what I covered above, what else can I tell you, Bartek?
@msskwan A small course called The LinkedIn PLaybook I sold for $50.
@byiliakarelin Go check me out :)
@april_storynook So many things differently. I don't even know where to begin.  But, I would have started Tweeting a year earlier or so.
@jarrylew I just share the opp in every newsletter, and put it on my website. You could Tweet about it or join ConvertKit's sponsor network too.
@NotechAna I'm so glad, Ana!
@farez Yes.
@dklineii Thank you, Dave!
@ItsKieranDrew You too, man! Watching you grow has been fun.
@matt_gray_ I don't have any freelancers. I have a part-time VA.  I hired @BrendanHufford to do some SEO work that was super helpful early on.  Other than that, it's just me and my wife.
@ranbirsinghlive It was very important. It helped pay the bills, Ranbir.
@michaelrhalcomb I just lost interest.
@JustinWise I appreciate your continued support, Justin.
@brianondrako Thank you so much for that, Brian.
@FitFounder Appreciate you man. Not my bday, but I'll take it :)
@Ethan_Mick Thank you, Ethan!
@ImraneSubstack Gone back to the drawing board, shipped more content, listened more, and shipped something new.
@Richard_andey Maybe. I could have sold it, but that felt gross to me for some reason.
@joonian Oh, I am.
@gregisenberg This is something I very much want to do, Greg.  It's going to happen.
@matt_gray_ You too brother :)
@TheTomYoungs THank you so much, Tom!
@wellymulia I have a part-time VA from a company. 20 hours per month.

@sean_deloughery Appreciate it, Sean!
@chris_gensheer Appreciate it, Chris.
@TumminelliTyler Thank you, Tyler!@
@mjovanovictech Hell yes! Congrats, Milan.   Keep going :)
@tomosman Thank you brother. How are you man?? I hope you're killing it with your community.
@janetacarr Haha. Thank you, Janet.
@blakeaburge I'm glad I did, Blake. I'd be talking about SaaS sales today if I didn't, which isn't as interesting to me.
@NiharikaSodhi Thank you so much, Niharikaa!
@chris_gensheer Nope. A smaller course before that called The LinkedIn Playbook.  It was $50.
@PEfund_guy I hope so.
@tspeeg Thank you.   I think those both played big roles in the journey, Tyler.
@byhazellim The latter. Although I tried to stick with what I knew Re: SaaS
@GoogleAdsElite Thanks, Ian!
@KurtisHanni I think so too, Kurtis.
@sweatystartup I like to think so.  Hopefully this wild thing will keep going, Nick.  Appreciate your support.
@SahilBloom Thank you, man! Appreciate your support.
@Joseph__Seifert Keep going, brother!
@chris_gensheer 100%. Signal and noise.
@MakadiaHarsh Appreciate it :)
@natolisnuggets Thank you, man!
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
I'm not sure what's next yet, but I'll be sharing as I figure it out.  If this was helpful, feel free to give me a follow.  If you have any questions, ask away.   Happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading.
A few last notes of potential interest:  1. I no longer do anything SaaS-related.  2. I don't do any paid advertising of any kind.  3. I don't have any employees, but I do have a wife that helps me stay very organized.
Finally, here's what my business revenue looks like:  Products:  $1.54M Consulting: $1.17M Community: $130k MRR: $84k Sponsorships: $76k
20/ Added sponsorships  With over 60k subs, I can charge for each issue to be sponsored.  I have 2 slots per issue, per week, that sell for $1,250.  Now each weekly newsletter is paying $2,500, and people are getting their brand and business in front of a ton of readers.
19/ Started a newsletter  In January of 2021, I launched my newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.  I was determined to deliver one piece of actionable advice each Saturday AM that could be read in 4 minutes or less.  In the last 11 months, I've grown it to 60k+ subs.
18/ Added MRR  I noticed that each week I was spending time creating content templates for myself.  What if my audience wanted those too?  I tested it as a $9 upsell on each course.  8 months later it has 1,700+ subscribers.  Almost $14k MRR from something I was already doing.
17/ Created a 2nd digital course  I was doing a podcast with @dickiebush and @nicolascole77 about how I built a system for writing content.  The 500+ people on the call seemed to be amazed by it.  That led to my 2nd course, The Content Operating System.
16/ Reinvested my time  With way more free time now, I decided to start Tweeting.  Using what I knew about growing on LinkedIn, I was able to hit 75k followers in about 6 months.  This provided a new channel to build more stuff.  So I did.
15/ Made a difficult decision  I loved my community but realized that it didn't work with my personality.  It was a $15k MRR business, but I felt like I had to be "on" 24/7.   That wasn't the life I wanted to build.  15 months after starting it, I made a decision to shut it down.
14/ Built a community  As sales picked up, my interest in consulting faded.  I was doing $2k per day in info products and wanted to run with that.  I opened a private community for creators and charged $199.   Those who completed my course were prompted to join.
13/ I began creating an army  At the halfway point of my course, people are encouraged to leave a testimonial and sign up for an affiliate program.  I built the same automation at the conclusion of the course.  I now have 800+ affiliates that have generated $110,000 in revenue.
12/ Marketed aggressively  With 100% of my LinkedIn content focused on audience growth, and a product directly related to that content, sales took off.  My previous course grossed $75k in 15 months.  The second version has grossed $186k in 3 months.  Next up...
11/ Tripled down  After the course was outdated, people started asking for a new version.  I rebuilt the course, but this time charged $150.  The earlier $50 price was my "trust tripwire".  I charged $50, delivered 100x worth the price, and built trust w/ a loyal customer base.
10/ Ran with it  Over the next 15 months, I sold about $75k of the course.  I posted about audience building on LinkedIn and found other ways to continue to land consulting clients. (VCs, news sites, blogs, SaaStr, etc)  Even though it felt confusing, I continued to run with it.
9/ Made my first product $$  I put the product for sale on Gumroad on April 16th, 2020.   In the first month, I made $10,482.   I was shocked.  I now had my first digital product, but it was in a totally different niche than my service business.  Honestly, this confused me.
8/ Tested a hypothesis  I had organically grown to 20k+ followers on LinkedIn &amp; people wanted to know more.  I had a hypothesis that this would be an easy info product I could create &amp; sell.  I put together a short course for $50 (more on price later) &amp; wrote posts about it.
7/ Kept my eyes and ears open  Something really interesting happened.  In an attempt to find common problems to productize, I started rereading my LinkedIn DMs.  I had some repetitive questions about SaaS sales, but I also had an inbox jammed with questions about LinkedIn itself.
6/ Reduced my time  With new rates, I could have worked the same and made 2x as much.   Instead, I chose to work 50% of the time and make the same.  I used that extra time to figure out how to scale income that was more automated.  My goal had always been to get my time back.
5/ 2x'ed my rates  With a well-defined niche, some happy customers, and testimonials, I 2x'ed my rates.  I started creating more content that was even more targeted. This led to more conversations with ideal-fit prospects.  I said no to any company outside of my niche.
4/ Found my ideal customers  Inside your customer base is more signals.  What are the commonalities between the customers you love &amp; those who love you?  Mine were early-stage SMB SaaS in the healthcare space. A space I was experienced in &amp; loved.  That became my ideal customer.
3/ Built a service business  My experience building SaaS was resonating. So I began creating more and more content about that.  Founders sent me DMs asking questions.   I responded to every single one.  Once I had prospects in my funnel, I started consulting.
2/ Honed in on signals  Inside all of that noise was some signals.  Sometimes I bombed, and sometimes I struck a chord.  The more I looked at what resonated, the more I doubled down.   This allowed me to understand what people cared about.  So, I kept writing &amp; talking about it.
1/ Created lots of noise  When I was just getting started, I looked at attention as my friend.  I wrote content every day before I even had a business, just to find my voice.  I started on LinkedIn.  I shared my thoughts &amp; observations about building a SaaS unicorn as the CRO.
Today, my little one-person business crossed $3M in revenue.  It took 1,187 days, I ran zero ads &amp; operate at a 94% margin.  Here are the 20 steps of my wild &amp; strange journey:  Hope it's helpful to someone.  [🧵 thread]
@MattiSchroder @JohnIsBuilding I price my products what I would feel comfortable paying for them.
@NiharikaSodhi @jonbrosio @abhishekshah173 Thank you, everyone!
@CSMikeCardona @Jay_Sapovits @JohnIsBuilding Always appreciate your support, Mike :) 🔥 Truly.
@Jay_Sapovits @CSMikeCardona @JohnIsBuilding I'm working towards being egoless.   I don't want to have to "win" an argument or "be right" about something.  I just do what I think is right, and if people decide I'm not right for them or their description o
@kaineoio @JohnIsBuilding You work on many things and then let the data guide you. Or you experiment a lot, see what works, and then do more of that.
@rakejoh @JohnIsBuilding It was a function of being forced.   I started having panick attacks and couldn't function.   I saved between 3-6 months of runway, I can't remember how much specifically.
@incremental1st @JohnIsBuilding A company valued at $1B or more.
@CSMikeCardona @JohnIsBuilding I don't know. I'm not trying to fit into a dictionary description, to be honest.  My VA works 20 hours per month, and is managed by another company, so if that disqualifies me, I'll start writing about duopreneurship :)   I 
@wander_wealth @JohnIsBuilding Kim told John that Brenda and Tommy are seeing each other.
@mustafa_kamal @JohnIsBuilding Feedback from followers, time with my wife, my parent's pride, tipping awesome servers $100 because I can, buying trips for my friends, etc.   No one thing. Many things.
@JohnIsBuilding I built a team of 150+ people at a unicorn and I now operate a 1-person, 7-figure business.  (Not a flex, just context)  They each have pros &amp; cons.  I like solopreneurship because I'm at a stage in my life where I don't want to manage
@oliviercantin Smart. I hadn't thought of this.
@victor_bigfield @tibo_maker Thank you!
@akhilnchauhan @tibo_maker @alexisgrant @thelindazhang Thank you!
@matt_gray_ I would add anything that @sivers writes to this list.  He's possibly the most practical writer I've read with regard to building things the right way, and sustainably.
@jayclouse @JamesClear @herfirst100K @Codie_Sanchez @sivers Just found this via @jspector newsletter.  Killer Tweet I would have otherwise missed.   Thanks, Josh + Jay!
@TrentAnders0n Thank you man!
@agazdecki The Founder's story markets to both your customers but also your future employees.
@dickiebush You ever mix the espresso and topo chico? From my understanding, it's a big thing in Japan. I tried it and loved it. Thoughts?
@EdLatimore Some people are so risk-averse that they never take even the smallest of risk which, in turn, is the riskiest thing of all.
@schlaf Unless the specifically agreed to be a part of your newsletter, I would not.
@AndreasPetker It's true.
@foundersuccess I've been in the room that makes the decisions. It's often just spreadsheet driven.
@_SchusterDev Always.
@natolisnuggets Even 15 minutes per day taking small steps can be helpful.
@abrahamcslls True story, Abraham.
@ThatMarket3r That's a positive outlook on a tough situation. Good for you, Moritz.
@HeyAmna1 Thanks, Amna.
@ideaeconomy @growthcurrency @AaronCrocco @jspector @CSMikeCardona Sure thing. I say stupid things all of the time. I'm glad people are at least listening 😂
If the wild uncertainty at tech companies reminds us of anything, it should be that we're all useful until suddenly we aren't.  If you're fortunate enough to have full-time employment, now is the best time to start preparing for this "what if" scenario in your life.
@growthcurrency @ideaeconomy @AaronCrocco @jspector @CSMikeCardona If you share the podcast link, I could also probably help clarify.  Back to the original point, I'd say at the beginning of anything you do, you must work hard.  It's how you transition fr
@growthcurrency @ideaeconomy @AaronCrocco @jspector @CSMikeCardona I don't work 12 hours per day, although occasionally I may if I need to.   I work between 5-9 hours per day.  I may have misspoken or been using the number as a way to exaggerate i.e. some
@benclarkdaily @SahilBloom  https://t.co/bR3mzhtV6R
@jonbrosio @dickiebush @matt_gray_ @jackbutcher @NiharikaSodhi @ItsKieranDrew @ericasmyname Thanks, Jon!
@SahilBloom Time is the only nin-renewable asset. Much easier to understand at 41 than 21. Wish I had recognized it earlier.
@perfexcellent Someday I may very well do that.  And I don't believe I owe the world a proactive explanation, although I'd likely provide one.
@PEfund_guy I'm almost 42 and I constantly think about what the 2nd half of my life will be like.  Do I want to be a better version of who I already am or a different version entirely?   Fun question to ponder.
@foundersuccess Always be curious, but also open and willing to change.
@I_Am_GKennedy Beautiful.
@jappleby @sgmpodcst Yep. I said something similar here:   https://t.co/7wFuhJuMUC
@ItsKieranDrew It starts with the mindset of "getting it right" instead of "being right".
@sgmpodcst @jappleby That's problematic, IMO.  Just say, "I used to think this, and now I think something different."  It's easy when you don't have an ego.
@dklineii 100% true.
@bfillmer Totally fair, but we don't owe the world a proactive explanation every single time we shift our perspective.
@BlackLabelAdvsr I'm not necessarily talking about conviction. There will always be things we believe in and don't waver on.  I'm talking about forming new opinions over time when presented with new information.
@jessedanyusufco For sure.
@TheTechOasis1 100%. I learn that things I was sure about are things I'm no longer sure about as I grow older.
@natolisnuggets Sure fire.
@jappleby "You said something different 5 years ago. You're now a fraud."
We tend to dunk on people who contradict themselves over time, but it's the people who never evolve their thinking that scare me the most.
@FitFounder @josephamiller I'm not talking about powerlifters. Just the average dude at the gym dropping weights, throwing shit around, and yelling a lot.   Also - don't take me too seriously. I'm just some random guy on the internet having a little fun.
@FitFounder  https://t.co/l7nV8kRRDU
@FitFounder Personally, I don't like gym "screamers".   We get it. You lifted heavy.
@EdLatimore Plus, it's significantly less fun.  Being around miserable people is just...miserable.
@PEfund_guy Depends on what you're looking for.  I think LinkedIn is better for b2b or b2c business, but Twitter is a much easier place to network effectively.
@agazdecki Take action and then let the results think for you.
@Nicolascole77 Say yes to everything, then say no to everything.
@ItsKieranDrew The simplest and most straightforward path to solopreneurship. You nailed it.
@KateBour Understanding your customers is something that will never go out of style.
@dickiebush Focus 100% of your effort on the 20% of things that move the needle.
@FitFounder I listen to non-fiction sometimes. Knocks me right out.
@thedankoe I say the same thing 1,000 different ways, and people still thank me each day for the new idea.
@muhammad0714 Thanks, Muhammad!
@chris_gensheer Thank you, Chris!
@SahilBloom Thanks, man. Same to your newsletter.
@gid_dev Thanks, Gideon.
@sidhant_k1 I'll share it in the newsletter tomorrow.
@blakeaburge You absolutely can, Blake. I think this one will be really relevant to you, honestly.
@ayush_pandeyy Appreciate it, Ayush.
@jessedanyusufco Thanks, Man!
In October of 2021, I jumped from LinkedIn to Twitter.  I leveraged my 125k followers on LI to start growing really fast here.  The secret?  - Inward momentum - Compound action - Outward momentum  Tomorrow, I'll break these 3 things down for 57,694 people:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG

@NickPickCodes @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @FitFounder @KateBour @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup Add new ones as they come into my ecosystem.
@SievaKozinsky Thanks, Sieva!
@wes_kao Yep. It's a lot like making money.  That's not a skill. Solving problems is a skill. Money is the outcome.
@TomConnan I sure think so. I know a lot of designers doing well. Artists seem to be similar albeit different.
@amirsanroberto Thank you. I'm just a normal screw-up like anyone else.
@KateBour Thank you , Katelyn :)
@ParkerRex Find the intersection of where your customers hang most and where you like creationg, and start there.
@austinbelcak Yup. Consistency is always the toughest part!

5 steps to a one-person business:  1. Talk to people 2. Understand what they need 3. Create content that helps them achieve 4. Service them one-on-one to learn solutions 5. Package those solutions into a product over time  Talk → understand → create → service → productize
@natolisnuggets @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @FitFounder @KateBour @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup Start your own "smart" group with 4-5 friends. As you all grow, you'll naturally attract other smart and interesting people.  The

And that's it.  TL;DR  1/ Built publishing habit in the AM 2/ Educated my audience each PM 3/ A step-by-step thread once weekly 4/ Engage with 5-8 people in my niche each week 5/ Commented underneath large accounts 6/ Eliminated what wasn't working 7/ Setup inspiration tools
Improved my "inspiration" swipe file:  Writing a lot of Tweets means constantly being inspired.  Here are the tools I use to find that inspiration:  @hypefury (Tweet templates) @TwemexApp (User's best Tweets) @typeshare_co (Thread templates) @TwitterBlue (bookmark fave Tweets)
Eliminated the "touch base" Tweets:  After 90 days, I had a publishing habit.  So I stopped the daily, "Happy Weekday" AM posts.  They weren't adding much value.  I started writing entertaining content or 2x'ing educational Tweets.
Comment underneath large accounts:  One of the best ways to gain visibility here is to participate.  - Find interesting, large accounts - Set up automatic notifications - Read each of their Tweets - Add valuable comments - Engage  It's literally that easy.  https://t.co/9NDh7HHlrN
Engage with 6-8 interesting people each week:  Make it a habit to build connections.  Here are some smart folks I've chatted with, just to jam out:  @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @TheDanKoe @dickiebush @FitFounder @KateBour @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup  It's "social" media.
A step-by-step thread once weekly:  Weekly threads powered my growth.  I gained hundreds of thousands of followers by sharing detailed threads.  My goal is to walk someone step-by-step through something critical in solopreneurship.
An educational tweet each PM:  Each afternoon, I share a lesson from my solopreneur journey.  Topics include:  - Solopreneurship - Online businesses - Building info products - Using social media effectively  I pretend I'm writing to help ONE person.
Built my publishing habit each AM:  In October 2021, I committed to publishing daily on Twitter.  I started with a "Happy {Day} to X" Tweet each morning.  I had 2 goals:  1. Build a habit of posting each day. 2. Put my name &amp; face in front of people daily.
A growing Twitter audience is an asset to any entrepreneur.  I've added 219,487 followers in one year.   Here are the 7 very simple things I did:
@AskJibran 21k (LinkedIn) and no email list on my first course.
@Mike_Walls_ @jspector Sure. I'm human, so I feel all of the normal emotions that anyone would feel charging $2,000.  To echo Josh's sentiment, I can generally solve the problem in 15 minutes and it's 100% worth the client not screwing around for another 
@RyoGranas That's a great definition, Ryo.
@ambitiousronen Thanks man!
@jspector I am confused, insecure, and worried. Can confirm.
@jonbrosio Underrated Tweet.  Nice work here, Jon.

Execute your promotion plan:  You're ready to execute your presale promotion plan.  Start by including the link to the landing page in your social profiles.   Add it to:  - Your Twitter profile - Your LinkedIn profile - Any Instagram or YouTube accounts you use  And launch!
Build a landing page in @Carrd:  Carrd is a simple one-page website builder that costs $19 per year.   You can use Carrd to build out a professional-looking landing page that helps improve conversion.  Here’s what it should include according to @harrydry of MarketingExamples  https://t.co/B4Z7fKFxNg
Build out your product in @Gumroad:  Once you have the first 3 steps completed, the hardest parts are done.   Now it’s time to build out your product in Gumroad.   I choose Gumroad because it’s fast, cheap, and easy.  Choose your product name, description, &amp; price to get started.
#NAME?
Create a presale promotional plan:  I presold for roughly 30 days because it gave me a little more time to drum up interest.  Next, decide what channels you’ll use to promote it:  - Social media - Your email list - Any community you’re in  Then, sketch out your promo content:
- What specific problem will you be solving?  - What are the benefits and outcome(s) a student can expect?  - Create an outline for your product that helps solve #1 and delivers #2.  - Keep it short: consider helping them reach their outcome in less than 
Create course benefits and outcomes:  Once you choose a topic, so many people start building out the product.   Please don’t do this.  Creating course benefits and outcomes is a step you can’t afford to skip.  Here’s what you want to clearly define:
Choose a topic you can talk about for 30 minutes:  Courses should be about transferring your knowledge to the student.  If you can’t talk about a topic for 30 minutes, unprepared, you probably don’t know enough to sell a course.  This is how you should think about your topic.
Everyone should own an online course that earns $150+ per day.  The problem?  Most people don't know how to build one.  Here are 6 steps that might help you get started.  ↓

@blakeaburge Yep. Let the audience guide you.
@har8narayan I shut it down.
@PEfund_guy I'm not sure, to be honest. I'd have to give that some thought.  I'm not super familiar with that world.  Ultimately, who are you looking to attract attention from?
@content_remedy I'd say you learn what goes into a digital product by running a service business first.
@paulabartabajo_ Thanks!
@hey_dhruv Yep. That's it.
@Max_Stevens6 I don't agree with that at all.  In fact, in the creator space, I'd say I'm more of an outlier.
The Solopreneur Revenue Funnel:  Discovery: Short-form content ↓ Trust: Newsletter/Podcast/Video ↓ Relationship building: Online community ↓ Service business: Advising/consulting/coaching ↓ Digital info products: Digital courses/subscriptions

Too many entrepreneurs are selling products or services for problems they haven't validated as painful.  The more existential the pain, the more people buy.

@Nicolascole77 "I can't believe you won't give me 15 minutes of your time!"  - 1 of 5,000 people asking who have never once interacted with me
@dklineii 100%.  I think at some point, relationships have to become mutual though.
@FitFounder Yep.   Everything works that way.  Want a mentor? Make yourself someone worth mentoring.
@KateBour Literally, everything.   "Hi - we don't know each other and have never interacted, but I have a project for you to do, for me, that does not benefit you at all. Down for that?"  Yeah.
@SahilBloom That old formula never fails.
@natolisnuggets Love that, Ant.
@AhmedSaeedBJ Thanks, Ahmed!
@ItsKieranDrew This is how my career finally took off.
@SystemSunday @FitFounder Learning to question everything you believe as fact allows you to reach more truth than you otherwise might. Good stuff, Ben.
@blakeaburge @austinbelcak He's the best.  I owe him some time, as I've been moving for the last 5 weeks and haven't been very communicative.  I didn't forget about you, @austinbelcak !
@JoshuaKatowitz Smart move, Josh.
@francis_oleh Yep. Last time I shared this I had 40k followers. Now 225k. That's 185k new people who have never seen it.
@natolisnuggets 100%. It's basically the only way.
@Richard_andey Thanks, Andrew!
@KurtisHanni Funny how the hack is never really a hack, huh? :)
@artists_voyage Thank you!
@sweatystartup Exactly. It's about the other person.  Nearly everyone gets this wrong.
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the first Tweet in this thread to share with your audience
It’s been 3 years since our first DM exchange, and we’ve supported each other’s growth since.  This is a really good example of building an organic relationship over time, and how you can work with people to grow together.  And believe it or not, we’ve still never met in person.
2020 to 2022  2020: Austin intros me to a great podcast I become a guest on. 2020: I learn Austin loves beer, I send him some Nashville IPAs. 2021: Austin is a guest in my private community for a presentation. 2022: We’re discussing doing business together.  https://t.co/QUh4apy1HA
2019 to 2020  2019: Austin DMs me &amp; shares a copywriting PDF he enjoys. 2019: I reach out &amp; we book a  Zoom cadence to chat business. 2020: I’m a guest on Austin’s LinkedIn Live event. 2020: We exchange LinkedIn recommendations.  https://t.co/QBW8K3nYum
An example of this in action:  One of the strongest online relationships I’ve formed over the past 3 years has been with @austinbelcak.   We first exchanged messages in July 2019 as up-and-coming creators.   Here’s how the relationship started and blossomed:
@itsterryrice Use DMs effectively to build relationships:  I don't need to reinvent the wheel here.   So, if you’re looking for an excellent primer on how to use DMs to build relationships online, read this Tweet thread from @thedankoe
Make a meaningful introduction:  Connecting 2 people who can help one another is powerful.  Solve their problem with a connection &amp; you leapfrog hundreds of other people trying to build that relationship.   @itsterryrice learned I needed help and reached out like this:  https://t.co/REv7agQNGw
Permissionless support:   Support someone w/o asking their permission.  You could share their content in your newsletter or create a visual of their Tweet.  That's exactly what @SachinRamje did with me, creating this beautiful visual that he shared:
Use a relevant, specific compliment:   Tell them something specific they’ve done that you enjoy.   If you liked a specific podcast/article, tell them why, and what impact it had on you.   Use a soft “out”:  i.e. "No need to reply, just wanted to share how it impacted me!"  https://t.co/SKwaruhB2e
Create a value-driven relationship approach:  When you reach out to someone, imagine you are one of 1,000 people doing the same thing. Yikes.  How can you differentiate yourself?  Provide value upfront with no expectation of immediate return.  Try 1 of these things weekly ↓
Your profile cheat sheet:  - Banner: Show off your brand - Headshot: Clean and polished - Bio: What are you doing &amp; what can people expect? - Pinned Tweet: Provide deeper context on your journey  Answer this: “What am I doing that's interesting enough for someone to follow me?”
Create a clear &amp; compelling profile:  To build strong relationships, you need to give people a reason to be interested in you.  Start with a clear and compelling profile.   This is your "digital first impression", just like a first impression offline.
Here's what you'll learn in this thread:  1.  Creating a digital "first impression" 2. Using a value-driven approach 3. Combining specificity with support 4. Making relevant intros 5. Using DM's effectively 6. An example of this in action  Let's go ↓
To start, trust me when I say this:   Your online network determines your level of success on platforms like Twitter, and largely in your business.  The bigger and stronger your network is, the more likely you are to be successful in whatever endeavor you choose.
Most people suck at building relationships online.  It's always:  - Help me! - Can I pick your brain? - Will you like my Tweet?  A terrible approach.  Here's how the top accounts on Twitter build real relationships:  🧵
@KateBour @TMitrosilis Thank you :)
@jonbrosio @TMitrosilis Thank you, my man :)
@alexcalish @levelsio I'm literally the least intimidating person on earth.
@AnonFloridaMan @levelsio Winner of the day.
@therobertleonar @levelsio It's super cool. Had a blast with it.
@mkhundmiri @levelsio I wish I had facial muscles like that! I don't, I can promise you that.   Secret: My profile pic is from when I was in exceptionally incredible shape.
@theandreboso @levelsio I'll take it :)
@light_ope @levelsio I'm the least fierce person ever :)
@bewritethere @levelsio Haha. I love this. A new small revenue stream.
Took @levelsio AI Avatar for a spin and now I want to work out more to look like this guy.  A lot of fun for just $30.  https://t.co/ECcrqVz8oc
@TMitrosilis I like Josh Spector's For The Interested.   He's probably the best curator around.
@SamueleOnelia Hope you enjoy it, Samuele.  Do the 2.0 first, then head to 1.0 to get the templatization instructions.  Cheers!
@AlexHustle7 Depends on what you mean by "better".  My favorite part of being a one-person business is total control and very few obligations.
@marcotonycampos Get after it, Marco!
@ItsKieranDrew Doing is the best way to force learning.
@HuttonPraesens Yes, but it always creeps back up.
@thesandeep0303 Thank you, Sandeep!
@CoreyWilksPsyD 100%.
@jakubzenkai Nobody.
@writes_eve A great way to test the waters!
@torreydawley That's right. You must have that comfort level.
@jarrylew I agree with all of this, Jarek.
@jappleby I'm not sure it ends, Jack :)
Solopreneurship forces accountability.   You own every single part of your business's successes &amp; failures. There's no team or boss or investors or peers or whatever to blame.   It's just you and your ability to analyze and execute.   Scary but also extremely freeing.
@Nicolascole77 Love your "book in bullets" Tweet.  I'm taking this to guide me on my book.
@dickiebush Love the idea of repurposing your best stuff in a recap style thread. Great stuff, Dickie.
@nathanbaugh27 @Codie_Sanchez @Dmurr68 @ColinandSamir @SahilBloom Thanks, man!
@FitFounder Exactly how I feel, Dan.
@incomenator Providing mediocre customer service puts you in the "best in class" category at this point.
@litwin_sonia True story.  Help others to help yourself.
@dickiebush Starting now. Roger that.
@BrianSexton13 That's it right there, Brian. Offer a better experience and make people feel like part of something.  Take the business from the corporate behemoth.
@theficouple Great focus!
@LBacaj There are so many options, sometimes I just don't even know where to start.
@KateBour Looking fwd to it, Katelyn!
@Nicolascole77 If it's good, the folks on this platform will find it.
@agazdecki This was my whole secret as an executive😂
@ItsKieranDrew Great list here, Kieran.  Always remember emotional outcomes as well:  - This person helped me - This person motivated me - This person challenged me - This person entertained me - This person understands me
@dellakirkman Also a great option, Della.
@EcomSpin For sure.
@CSMikeCardona I love my service business :)
@foundersuccess And most of it for free, or for an affordable subscription price.
@KateBour That last sentence captured it, Katelyn.
You don't need a flashy new idea to build a business.  Go find:  - Antiquated industries - Slow companies - Poor service  Use technology to do a better job &amp; you'll likely start chipping away.  Start small and take a few customers.  A much easier introduction to Solopreneurship.
@Girirajjhawar07 @rashiaroraoff @alexgarcia_atx Thanks, man!
@GeoffTRoberts Yea sir.
@Davidco85846237 The floor is dark brown wide plank wood. When our furniture gets in it’ll look great
@thetomschaeffer Reno!
@natolisnuggets Hell yeah.
@CoreyWilksPsyD @theKevinShen Thanks for this. Need to set up my "perfect office" soon and this will come in handy.  @theKevinShen - you should charge for onsite visit and set up!
@TobiasE97319503 Thanks, Tobias!
@CoreyWilksPsyD No, that will eventually be our master.  My office will have the same flooring (done) and will likely get a dark paint job as well as some built-ins.
@timgabedesign Brand new poly. Will dry soon.
@louisduboscq I appreciate it
@jen_shirley Thanks, Jen!
@StephenCourson Look great!
@Richard_andey Thanks, man!
@JohnpaulBened09 Living :)
@foundersuccess Same here. Been fun so far (to watch)
New beams, floors, and paint are going up in the Mountain House.  Coming along nicely.  https://t.co/KIiWChKint
@ItsKieranDrew Start wide, cast a big net.  Let your audience steer you toward who you are and what you are.
@ItsKieranDrew @KateBour You’re also always dealing with people on the most important day of their lives.   That can be stressful!
@matt_gray_ Thanks so much for featuring my newsletter, Matt.  Means a lot to be included amongst these other fabulous entrepreneurs. Cheers, brother.
@elifozgecanhiz This was my hope.
What business would you build if you were guaranteed success, but had to spend the next 25+ years working on it?
@levelsio Bought mine today.  This looks like a lot of fun, and a great business. Congrats, @levelsio.

@darovera After training, she runs this all on her own.
@survivallama @zapier Because they aren’t solvable through automation.
@NikolaStark_x @ThatMarket3r She left the company I hired her through. She didn’t leave me.   She just found a full time gig.
@MarshallSMorris 35-50
@theDanKelly It's on the worksheet dropdown in the last Tweet.
@hiteshmahajan_ No apologies needed! Have a good one, Hitesh.
@hiteshmahajan_ It's all in the thread.
@craigshoemaker  https://t.co/q1GMObsAmB
@thatroblennon 100%, Rob.
@matt_gray_ ❤️
@natolisnuggets She does by playing gatekeeper.  I just hit "no" in the dropdown and she sends the "No Template"
@blakeaburge @matt_gray_ @FitFounder @AlexHormozi Thank you, man!
@matt_gray_ That's the game plan.
@PEfund_guy Just a couple'a fellas jammin out in the sauna, chatting about my Twitter account. Love it LOL
@matt_gray_ Nice thread, Matt.  I'm so glad you enjoyed the LinkedIn course. I remember you buying it, taking it, and then reaching out to me.  Knew you were gonna hit it big. Congrats!
@oliviercantin If you have any questions, DM me.
@ThatMarket3r I literally just set a demo with Zirtual and they asked me some questions and sent me a VA. She was great, but she ultimately left.  So I just pinged a bunch of people I knew until I was intro'd to my current VA and we did a trial.
@oliviercantin Hope it's helpful!
@tomosman It's a game changer, Tom.
@PEfund_guy I have no employees. I have a part-time VA.
@ThatMarket3r 100%, Moritz.
@vishal_thinks It's in the thread.
@TheSuddenWealth Seriously.
@sweatystartup Uh oh.  Here come the angry folks.
@barrettjoneill So much value, man. Couldn't work without one.
If anyone wants to save some time, head into my GDrive and make a copy of this Excel sheet.   https://t.co/B6GP4jLfaF
@blakeaburge Why are they having a Championship? Aren't you already the winner? Weird.
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
TL;DR:  1. Audit your time 2. Record process videos 3. Store videos in Notion 4. Work together 1:1 for a month 5. Introduce workflow triggers 6. Review weekly
The Outcome:  Rather than context switching &amp; losing time, I review our worksheet 1x in the AM and in the PM.  This has saved me ~2 hours per day.  That's 40 hours per month.  And with firms like Zirtual charging $750 per month for a VA, it's a great way to get your time back.
Review weekly:  Every single week, we catch something that we aren't prepared for.  A new type of inquiry leads to a new video, new instructions, new templates, and new triggers.  So we build them out together.  It's an iterative process that gets better every single week!
Move to a trigger-based system:  Once we had worked together for a month, I introduced a trigger system.  1: Grant access to my email 2: She puts each email into a spreadsheet 3: I select the intended action from a drop-down 4: She sees the trigger and takes appropriate action  https://t.co/DKXXDjShQK
Spend quality 1:1 time:  Spend your first few weeks or a month, working together 1:1  Meet regularly, give direct feedback, and listen if they have suggestions.  Some VAs are so experienced that they make your processes 10x better.
Store the videos in Notion:  Upload videos to a Notion page with additional instructions.  The most common instructions:  - Email templates to respond to prospects and customers - Links to other resources to support their work - Tone and etiquette guides
Record Process videos:  Your VA won't always have the background to understand what they’re solving &amp; why.  So, record a video where you walk through every single step.  Share these with a few people who have no context &amp; see if they can complete the tasks you teach on video.
Audit what distracts you the most:  I pay close attention to my schedule to understand when I am most distracted, by what, and how often.  I keep a running tally each week to make sure I'm identifying any new distractions that have crept up.  Awareness is your first step.
Hiring a virtual assistant is life-changing.  My VA saves me ~40 hours of my time per month.  Here's exactly how we work together in 6 simple steps:
@matt_gray_ One action away from changing your life.  Good stuff, Matt.
@iamjennylane I'm so glad!
@Nicolascole77 Thanks, my man. Experimenting with something a bit different.
@persuasionkid A bit different.
@FitFounder See you tomorrow, Dan. Much appreciated :)
@SahilBloom Appreciate it, brother.
@blakeaburge Thank you, my man!
@Ethan_Mick A superpower for sure, Ethan.
@HU_Copywriter See you tomorrow.

@dvassallo @arvidkahl I've got solid Wi-Fi, a whole house generator, and 500 gallons of propane. I'm ready!
@jasonakinaka I think so!
@dougmcsorley Yep!
@justindbooysen Deer and the occasional bear.
@leadoeslinkedin Thankfully yes. 😆
@thesteveburnett NY
@ActuallyAdrianG Hudson Valley NY
@JStaatsCPA Canvas bag for sure!
@kstealey Thank you man!
@TheDannyNaz Fireman Justin.
@JoshuaKatowitz Lol.
@natolisnuggets So much firewood. I have 2 other spots full too.
My new backyard has that “leaving behind civilization” vibes.  https://t.co/7yE7oSS7Ft
People vastly underestimate the value of their knowledge.  Publish yours and let the market pleasantly surprise you.
@realstephenlock @paritydeals is what I use.
@dickiebush Great thread.   One thing I’d add is to remain humble and always praise others vs. taking credit.   When I was a CRO I tried my hardest to give credit to everyone on my team and in other departments when we successfully hit our targets.
@bradsbranding My courses are all $150.
@ItsKieranDrew Psychology has been the most helpful part of learning to write effectively. Writing is less about typing on a keyboard and more about understanding the emotional drivers of your readers.
@KateBour 1. Understand your happy drivers 2. Build a lifestyle focused on those 3. Build work around that lifestyle 4. Compete to nail #2 and #3
@dickiebush Everyone thinks the microscope is on them, but it's reassuring to find out that we're far less important than we think we are.
@thedankoe And you'll also find out that most of your judgement comes without the proper context surrounding the other person or situation.   Learn to observe, but also learn to curious and empathetic.
@robertoblake Yep, or just a small one-person b2c SaaS even.
@matt_gray_ Enjoying the new visuals, Matt 🔥
@robertoblake I just use that term to mean a SaaS that is built as a lifestyle business or to be sold/acquired vs. building some large unicorn company.
@timgabedesign I am at some point.  I don't have a terrific idea at the moment, but if I can partner with someone who is aiming at my audience, I can handle distribution.
@FitNFortune I was profitable from day 1 because I started building a niche audience about 6 months prior to leaving my job.
@SahilBloom Name it and claim it.
@HaimSchlesinger I don't necessarily think that's true. I focused on 2 right out of the gate and was successful with that.
@AuthorOnTheSide All of them, which is why it's so powerful to simply get started.
@gabriellefrieda Absolutely. I've got that now.
@HU_Copywriter Thank you!
Treat your career like a Venture Capitalist.  Build a portfolio of revenue streams, knowing one will hit big.  1. Courses 2. Coaching 3. Micro-SaaS 4. Subscriptions 5. Paid community 6. Consulting &amp; advising 7. Newsletter/podcast sponsors  The diversified solopreneur.
@Yannick_Veys Thanks for the shout, Yannick!
@ChristinaAllDay The Catskills Mountains in NY.
@dagorenouf You're blazing your own trail and will be waving back at me in your rearview in no time.  Keep going.
@dennis_geelen @KateBour @amandanat @ericasmyname @wes_kao @jayclouse @jspector Thank you 🙏
@Richard_andey That's it right there, Andrew.
@FreeSites_com Ha. Thanks, Jeff.
@kulkarniankita9 Because anyone can crack the code on impressions through decent writing and a little support network of other "engagers". Pretty simple.  Making money? Not so much.
It's easy to manufacture impressions.  It's hard to manufacture revenue.
@dagorenouf Sounds huge. You should be super proud of yourself.
@ChristinaAllDay We do 5-6 miles daily.   It's tough not to when this is 5 minutes away:  https://t.co/JsgOXpqfvP
@OneJKMolina Haha. I'm considering automating it.  https://t.co/whwWMHIoNG
@RyanHVaughn There is plenty of time in between these things for serendipity.
@XyzCammy Yep. Same.
@getthinkable I talk with my wife. We generate so many ideas during that time.
@XyzCammy My wife :)
@darentsmith Yep. It's different for everyone.   The takeaway is just focusing on that which brings you the most joy.
@SteffenSzameit1 My mission is to help people identify and leverage skills they already have to build a more intentional life through solopreneurship.
@buildinglegends Pinot Noir or New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.
@IshwarJha I just can't get into meditation.
@francis_oleh @thedankoe Typing.
@Varun_Bosmia I generally write 4 pieces of content and work on my newsletter. But it varies daily depending on what I'm motivated by.
@mistamile Nope. With my wife.  We walk outside.
@kevinp_tweets Thanks, Kevin!
@jappleby Yes, here at the end of this newsletter issue:  https://t.co/UExlAc0cqo
There are 5 things I love doing each day:  1. Writing for 90+ minutes 2. Walking for 75+ minutes 3. Making lunch with my wife 4. Helping my customers win 5. Having a beautiful glass of wine  I'm determined to eliminate, automate or delegate almost everything else.

If you're truly entrepreneurial, you don't need to ask internet strangers how to start your business.  Nobody's feedback will be as helpful as the feedback you get when you just start.  Start, then learn.
@SahilBloom I just had to get new insurance for NY state, and it was a nightmare.  Unclear, tons of brokers and middlemen, and no visibility into what insurance will actually cover.  Plus, at $1,100 a month for 2 people, it's simply a non-starter for many
@reach_growth You said it better than I did, Nate.,
@SahilBloom Definitely. No path is the path for everyone, but I'd argue that more people than we think could succeed as solopreneurs.  With the definition of success being healthy, happy, and earning enough to invest each month.
@gethebizz Ain't that the truth.
@barrettjoneill That's the harsh reality, man.
@SachinRamje 100% it is, Sachin.
@Boyturnman That's it right there.
@jarrylew Smart move, Jarek.
@iamjennylane It's too bad they can't find jobs they love that also provide flexibility and capital for their side gigs.
Never destroy your mental and physical health for a company that would terminate you instantly if it meant a few extra cents on their share price.  Find a good company, use your salary as investment capital, and fund your side project until you have traction.  Then leave.
@dvassallo @QuiteBrazen @GuruAnaerobic Claims without data (or proof of another kind) to support them are just that. Claims.  We can all make claims and suggest a data integrity challenge about nearly anything to make up for not having data.  It just take
@QuiteBrazen @GuruAnaerobic @dvassallo "There were no positive effects from taking the vaxx. The biggest fraud in my lifetime.?  "The sars-cov2 virus was bio-engineered and escaped from a lab. Possibly the biggest crime in my lifetime."  But I just didn't
@QuiteBrazen @GuruAnaerobic @dvassallo Yeah, maybe I tied the two together without realizing they weren't directly related. That's fair.  In the end, I was just looking for more clarity on the original statements.  He made 2 bold claims:
@QuiteBrazen @GuruAnaerobic @dvassallo No actually it wasn’t on purpose. It was a miss on my part. You’re mistaking my question for an argument when I’m actually genuinely curious.
@GuruAnaerobic @dvassallo Genuinely curious: how did you go from "biggest fraud in my lifetime" to "I'm no expert on this"?
@tgs0376 Yes sir
@CallMeElleTwo Moved!
@iamjankoch Yep, but I didn't always.
@Richard_andey Amazing. Great comment, Andrew. Love it.
@darentsmith 100%.   Prove you know what you're doing. Figure out where you are right and wrong.   Then package up the right.
@thisiswenzel Real friends pay.
@francis_oleh LOL.
@jarrylew Agreed. A lot of cliche statements aren't true.
@CSMikeCardona Exactly. That's the ticket right there, Mike.
Don't sell without credibility.  Here's how to build some:  - Figure out who you enjoy spending time with - Talk to them about their challenges - Learn how to solve them - Share what you learn - Repeat  Do this for a year, and you'll build a wonderful reputation.  Then sell.
@Emilio_emb This business will always just be me.   I may build a company some day but only if I'm inspired to.
@JaviEug 3 years and 2 months.
@writingtoriches Thanks for the shout, my man.  Very much appreciated, Charles.
@KurtisHanni Right, Kurtis?
@karlsutt Thanks, Karl!
@thealibilawal Me too, Ali.
@dellakirkman 1. Start. 2. Analyze. 3. Keep going.
@tomosman Perfect GIF choice.
@heykahn Haha. I'm not even hating. I love VC-backed businesses, but man oh man...generating organic attention online is tough to beat.
@ItsKieranDrew It's wild times we're living in, Kieran. Might as well take advantage of them.
@maxi_page And you're only competition is really yourself.
@torreydawley Thank you, Torrey!
@har8narayan Literally, anyone.
@jennylane_fes It's possible. Just takes some time.
@JG__II I just moved here. See ya there!
@wellymulia Some.
@timjcarden It just takes a first step.
@TimelessTools I love it, Pedro. The Solopreneur mantra.
@foundersuccess Amazing huh?
My little one-person digital product business in The Catskill Mountains in NY generates more impressions, and more revenue, at higher margins than the average early-stage, VC-backed, B2B startup marketing teams using $50k+ marketing software.  Internet leverage is incredible.
@CSMikeCardona @mihapuc @arvidkahl It's been the price that has converted highest at the best average revenue per unit for my business.
@arvidkahl $150
@wes_kao @HansRosling It's one of (if not) my favorite books.  I read it and then listened to it the second time around.  So necessary in today's world.
@mopsywer @matt_gray_ Heck yeah. I love Mexico City.  Next trip there will be my 10th. Thanks!
@thatroblennon Thanks for the feature, Rob!
@matt_gray_ CDMX is my favorite.  Best lunch spot for people watching? Contramar.  Get the tuna tostadas and then green and red fish. Lovely.
@ItsKieranDrew I was a field sales rep for 8 years. 100% agree.
@JoshuaKatowitz Sometimes you can guide the prospect right into selling themselves if you deeply understand their problem and can articulate the solution.
@schlaf My father started in sales in 1970 and retired in 2020.   50 years, one company, first-ballot hall of famer.
@TheDividendGoat Placement is great. Learning how to articulate value and sell will accelerate that.
@theficouple I love that.
@SirajoMusa_ It's a skill just like shooting a basketball or hitting a baseball.
@barrettjoneill Absolutely, Barrett. The most critical skill to learn, IMO.
@CSMikeCardona The best skill to have, IMO.
Want to build a powerful one-person business?  Learn how to sell.  Every single day you're selling something:  - Idea - Vision - Product - Solution - Customers  Learn to sell and you're a one-person distribution machine.
Today is a fantastic day to log off of the internet.  Because creativity comes during your brain's resting state.   That state when you're not paying attention to anything in particular, but incubating ideas without even realizing it.  See you all tomorrow.
@SahilBloom Fame seems awful.  I get enough social media anger as a little niche account here on Twitter. I can't imagine what famous stars deal with.
@dr I used to love threads.  But there are only so many websites and Chrome extensions that are "so good (they should be illegal!)" threads that I can stand.  But, the market seems to respond, so I guess that makes me wrong? Oh well.
@thelifeofrishi Appreciate this. Will get signed up later today and check it out. Thanks, Rishi!
@wes_kao Thank you, Wes!
@AlexAndBooks_ Appreciate you including The Saturday Solopreneur, Alex. Much love, man.
@todd_herman @upcoachapp @Gladwell I could do something that I've done before, potentially (that they haven't seen). Shoot me a DM and I'll give you my email.
@MohamedWalidDev Upstate NY.
@todd_herman @upcoachapp I'm not doing much until I finish a massive book project on my plate :)
@bruno_nwogu Mostly just tiring.
@thealexbanks Thank you, Alex!
@prvsomani Focus on one until you deeply understand it. Then diversify.
@Nicolascole77 And your unique viewpoint on a subject makes it original. Isn't that wonderful?
@ItsKieranDrew Bookmarked. This is wildly helpful as someone who writes daily.
@KateBour Wow. That is really, really interesting. Don't drink a coffee and walk into a luxury store.
@dickiebush Damn. 5am and out the door? That's commitment, Dickie.
@thedankoe With each piece of content you ship, you chip away at the bad habit of continued inaction.
@heykahn You're the model, Zain. You kill it everywhere. Gold touch.
@ItsKieranDrew Yeah, I feel that.  I'm just getting bored seeing all of the top 10 tools, top 10 websites, top 10 chrome plugins, etc.  People love them, so doesn't matter what I think, but I'm gonna step back and wait until that all blows over.
@matt_gray_ Thank you, brother!
@theBMcopywriter It sure does, Zohaib. I've tested the same things.
@TimeToLevelUp_ Thank you so much!
@JosephSeifert22 Amazing, Joseph. Congrats, man.
@foundersuccess Thanks, Marcus!
@SahilBloom Ain't happening (maybe!)
@dickiebush Dude. Epic.  Congrats on the weight loss. I need to join this plan!
@blakeaburge Same, man.  It's been a blast connecting with you all.
@dickiebush Thank you, my man. Just trying to catch you and Sahil and all the greats.
@FitFounder I appreciate it, Dan! Enjoying your LinkedIn content a ton.
@jyriand Most of them nowadays are just tools, websites, etc.
@jasonstrimpel @pyquantnews That's so amazing man. Congrats!
@ThomasKStrider Nah.  Just a little traction this AM.
@Alek_Octopus Great takeaways.
@iamjeremyenns @SahilBloom I'll take it!
@JoshuaKatowitz Hell yeah. Thank you so much, Josh. What a great compliment to receive.
@SahilBloom Thank you, my man. Just trying to catch you.
@YourFriendAbdul Congrats, Abdulmalik!
@torreydawley I love that comment, Torrey.
@iamjeremyenns Thanks, Jeremy!
@MyLearningNotes For sure, Justin.
@KetanNashit Thank you so much, Ketan. Much appreciated man.

Tomorrow, I'm going to break down 3 more keys to my success over the last year in my weekly newsletter.  If you're trying to grow a Twitter audience, it's a must-read.  Come join 55,478 subscribers to The Saturday Solopreneur here:   https://t.co/X3l2wfO686
Karma is Real:  The more I've gone out of my way to help people here, the more people have come back to help me.  If you're not sure how to start leveraging this platform, start by helping.  Offer guidance, assistance, connections, etc.  That's a way to get quick wins.
Your Network is Your Twitter-Worth:  I've been fortunate to connect with some really high-impact creators this year.  By building relationships online and offline, my. content has been amplified by their engagement.  I wish I would have started networking sooner.
Education is Key:  If I look at the Tweets that ended up driving views on my profile, they are mostly when I teach something.  Platitudes have their place, but if you can't teach or educate, it's tough to show off your expertise.  Try your best to teach in 280 characters.
Threads Matter:  Of my top 10 performing posts, 9 of them are threads.  But, I see so many listicle threads nowadays that I've drastically reduced threading.  Outside of this small thread, I want to wait until sharing really valuable information comes back in style.
Last week I Tweeted for the 365th day in a row.  This is what happened:  - 134.59M impressions - 208,656 new followers - 13.957M visits to my profile  These are the 4 key lessons I learned:

@jhreha No. It's Lake Minnewaska in NY.
@Zbijelic Nah. Too cold :)
@dennis_geelen Yeah, Lake Minnewaska!
@thedankoe Hell yeah,.
@LBacaj So true, Louie. I had like 3 good ideas during this one...
@liana_majed Amazing view!
@BrianFeroldi Same here, Brian.
@OzolinsJanis Hell yeah, man. Love it :)
@hey_brantley Hell yeah. Congrats!
@ChristineCarril Lake Minnewaska right near my house.
@blakeaburge Lake Minnewaska!
I'm a solopreneur so I can go on mid-day hikes without asking permission.  https://t.co/ThV6HPJVDu
@mattragland Super bummed I miss this. Next one Upstate?
@BlackLabelAdvsr Thank you, Jon :)
@ranbirsinghlive Sure. Just start Tweeting.
@TheRedScarf7 That's part of the learning process.
@creation247 That's how you get started.  Everything goes from there...
@priyankaiitk Nailing it here, Priyanka. Congrats on your business!
@FitFounder Yep.  You don't need to read 50 blog posts or articles.  Starting gives you the information you need to get better.
@GlennPoulos All free.
@ItsKieranDrew Isn't that the best, man? I remember my first payment like it was yesterday.
@TheTechOasis1 Nope. I don't know much about SEO.
@TheNickKorwin Teach people something specific every day.  Skip platitudes and observations.
@Student4everOne I love it, Jagadeesh.
@philipjabenton Congrats!
@jarrylew Downhill in a good way :)
@gideon_shawana I'm trying.
@bhardwaj_srijan Exactly, Srijan.
@jasonstrimpel Just put one foot in front of the other.
Imagine that tomorrow, you finally decide to build a simple landing page, start talking about the problem you solve daily on Twitter, and nervously ask people to visit that page where they can buy a product or service you offer.   Congrats. You're on your way to Solopreneurship.
@bewritethere This is awesome, Pranshu. I love seeing your creativity applied to my Tweet.  Thanks for sharing this!
What's a challenge you have as a creator that nobody has been able to solve?
@AmandaMGoetz She really is ❤️
@hurtandgay @alananybusiness Oh, I know.  I just don't need that much.
@FitFounder Love that reframe, Dan.
@theficouple Same here!
@JakeMRichards Thanks, Jake!
@TymHartwich Help others to help ourselves.
@har8narayan Exactly, har.
@JoshuaKatowitz Thanks, Josh.  It feels good when it comes back full circle.
@ryandeniswalker Thanks, Ryan!
@blakeaburge Funny huh? :)
@PatThePM Wild huh? It's why attention is shifting, IMO, Pat.
@bewritethere Appreciate it, man!
@SahilBloom The whole damn thing.  Help others to help yourself.
@toluwaniadewole Yes. Look at politicians.
@bewritethere I love that way of thinking about it, Pranshu.
@timgabedesign Win Win for sure, Tim.
Solopreneurship is a Karma game.  I'm convinced that helping others over the course of your career is the single greatest investment you can make.  People who succeed without this are the exception, not the rule.
@blakeaburge This is being added to my Content System.  Absolutely love this, man.
@mikefutia Amazing! Great work, Mike.
Solopreneurship is about leadership.  You're not leading a team, but you're expected to lead your customers to the goals &amp; outcomes they desire.  So, check your messaging everywhere:  - Content - Website - Newsletter - Product pages  Is it customer outcome-focused or you-focused?
@Nicolascole77 I've personally found that AI writing tools make my job harder, not easier.  I'd rather stare at a blank screen than at a pile of random words.  But, I also think we're just at the beginning and the future is bright.
@schlaf I just came back from one of these with the intention of sharing it. Now, I'm just a copycat!
@ThomasKStrider @CSMikeCardona Smart. Shoulda led with that!
@CSMikeCardona Haha. Terrible advice 😆
Next time you have a tough choice to make in your business, ask yourself this simple question:  "What choice would I make if I wasn't afraid?"  Whatever it is, there's your answer.
@thedankoe Nice thread here, Dan.  I think a lot of people in the one-person business space want to explore all of their interests at once.  What's better is to become an authority in a niche space and then expand outward, slowly over time.
@LeeMcLaren11 @MrJacobEspi @thedankoe Thanks, Lee. Much appreciated.
@natolisnuggets Ooh. I love that, man!
@onepersonbizguy Certainly does.
What you work on is more important than how hard you work on it.
@barrettjoneill You know SEO is a key focus of mine in 2023. Love this thread, Barrett.
@TimelessTools Sounds like lucky more than unlucky.
@lawsy122 I think the answer is so different for everyone.  Maybe a good rule of thumb could be 60% or 70%?   But, again, financial circumstances are so wildly different for every person.
@sean_deloughery Bias toward action is a key theme in my life.
@thecolbykultgen It always kept me balanced too, Colby. Exactly!
@dgledesma Just keep going, Diego.
@torreydawley I thought of my 9 to 5 as investment capital. Love this approach, Torrey.
@bewritethere Love it, Pranshu.
@SahilBloom A few thoughts:  What is something my family and friends ask me for help with often?  What is something my colleagues come to me for, or projects at work that my boss often puts on my plate?  Answer those questions and try and intersect them w
@CheetSheets Keep working. It's a marathon.
Build a one-person side project.  If you're lucky, it grows bigger &amp; maybe you make enough money to quit your 9 to 5.  And if you're even luckier, you build something so meaningful that you exit, retire, &amp; work on passion projects.  But it's all a dream without a bet on yourself.
@jesseogtm Thanks, my man. ❤️  I’ve got 5 impostors at all times. Finally had to stop trying to eliminate them. Twitter doesn’t care unfortunately.
@scottsanchez Lol. "Prime Quitting", "Pinnacle Quitting", "Quitting for 2nd", "Meaningful Quitting", the list goes on...
@_nathanrene I love this.
@_nathanrene I'm only good at things for about 4.5 years.   So, expect a nano-brewery or pizza restaurant in a few years 😂
@willstew I am.
@ndwignall Really good reframe. I like that.
@heyimSalB I did 3 months. But it's different for everyone. Some should have 12.
@maikroservice Love that, Maik.
@GrammarHippy That's how you stay in the game long term.
@jasonstrimpel Win-Win-Win.
@KusshalPatel Thank you!
@schlaf Inspired by our conversation :)
@KusshalPatel Is this part of a larger tweet from him? Would love to read it if you have the link handy.
@francis_oleh I hope you read it! 😂
@hey_rois All critically important things to understand, Matan.
High-performers are quitting in their prime.  I know 10+ people who reached the pinnacle of their space, looked around &amp; realized everyone around them was unhappy.  So they quit &amp; pursued something vastly different, armed with their knowledge &amp; a Twitter account.  How freeing.
@DaniQuelchy @Nicolascole77 I struggled between this line and that one. Two of my faves.
@okcmayor Nice work, man! Thanks for putting it together 🙌🏻
@SteveOnSpeed Thank you, my man!
@dickiebush Great framework, Dickie.  Part of learning is also gravitating toward the things that you're truly and naturally curious about.  Learning becomes so much easier when it's a curiosity rather than force that's driving it.
Making $200k/yr selling info products broken down:  - $16.7k per month - Which is $540/day - Which is 4 customers @ $135 - Which is 285 daily web visits at 1.4% conversion  Mind you, none of this is easy.  But it's certainly easier than staring $200k in the face without a plan.
@Nicolascole77 "I’ve never been so alone, and I’ve never been so alive."
@Ethan_Mick Great addition here, Ethan.
@jjtalentcoach People think you build a product, then look for distribution.  I think that's a recipe for failure. Build your distribution channel first. You'll learn more about prospective customers, what they want, and what not to build.  When you final
Solopreneurship simplified:   Step 1: Build competency  Step 2: Build distribution  Step 3: Build product  Step 4: Build systems  Start niche, move slowly outward over time.
@mpickle @thedankoe I can certainly appreciate that side too.
@thedankoe It's why I can't understand choosing to either work for a business or start a business you aren't in love with.  Work literally becomes life. Make sure you enjoy it.
@dickiebush Everyone sharing revenue. Few sharing income.
@agazdecki Everyone, not just founders, should have their origin story. It gives such context to nearly everything you do in life.
@sweatystartup Goodnight Moon.
@KateBour People always ask me, "Should I write, share images, record videos, or do a podcast?"  Do what you enjoy. That's where consistency comes into play.
@tomosman Appreciate you, Tom. Hope you're well brother.
@SahilBloom See you there, man.
@FitFounder Thank you, my man!
@bhardwaj_srijan I don't have a podcast, but for my newsletter, I charge 5% of total subscriber base per issue.

@mmuxdesign I know right? How embarrassing 😂
@TMitrosilis So nice...
@RileyVasquez I just left TN :)
@WatkinsTBen @writingtoriches I didn't enjoy TN, but that's just me. I prefer NY or CA, and so we moved to NY but 2 hours north of the city.  Not humid as of yet.
@SDeggans It's in Upstate, NY (Accord, NY)
@tamintegration I do.
@writingtoriches It's upstate NY. Moved!
@AlexAndBooks_ Love Cider!
@gregisenberg 🍺  (I don't know what's going on)
@GeoffTRoberts Accord, NY.   Specifically Inness Hotel &amp; Club right now.
@GeoffTRoberts Just moved up here. 🏔
@OneJKMolina  https://t.co/B4cDzJmDpF
@OneJKMolina Cool. I think you'll likely continue to add? If so, we're speaking the same language. I don't mean begin with 4-5. I just mean you're more likely to hit your income goals, in the long run, with multiple. That's all.
@OneJKMolina Do you have 4-5 income streams now?
I'm a solopreneur so I can have the occasional mid-day autumn beer with my wife.  https://t.co/HZV14YCbui
I love non-technical solopreneurs building their own one-person businesses.  I'd love to see more of them in my feed.  Who should I be following?
@dr_ulum_s Agreed. All good things are, though!
@mihapuc Lots of people put all of their focus into one thing and fail.  Why not try many things and focus on what you get traction with?
@jjtalentcoach You start with diversity and allow traction to pull you into focus.
@davidfuesser I do it underneath one umbrella.
@MrShaneBreslin @dvassallo You should join! I'm part of it, and it's wonderful.
Your self-employed income goals are more likely to be achieved with a portfolio strategy.  Think 4-5 smaller income streams.  Provides much greater flexibility and reduced risk when compared to one big bet.
@gmitslouie Thanks for including me with these folks, Louie. Much appreciated.
@coachmillyj You're welcome!
@SahilBloom Except move the 7 to the front :)  You've got a lot of influence and I always appreciate that you use it positively.
@HeyAmna1 If you have this mindset, you won't have 1 follower for long, Amna :)
@MalkanKaya Awesome, Kaya!
@ergestx Thank you, Ergest!
@TYonClubhouse Nope. Just a simple observation.
@TheMBA_coach True story, Ashley.
@CheetSheets And the easiest to take part in.
@TomBeemSays Sure thing, Tom!
@thehowietan Every day, Howie.
@priyankaiitk Just one small share each morning and you're exponentially improving how lucky you can be in the future.
@albadawee Love that, Sohaib.
Every morning, I wake up with the realization that I can create my own luck, at scale, by helping 217k+ people who have decided to give me a small sliver of their attention.  There is infinite upside and very limited downside to sharing what you learn each day.
@emmadavisuk While I can't tie it exactly to Twitter, my revenue will double in 2022 vs. 2021 with margins of around 93% to 94%.

@TMitrosilis Thanks for turning me on to The Second Mountain. One of my favorites!
@anthonylcarter Just get started. Then learn.
@philiponfood I had 4,000 followers 12 months ago.
@FitFounder You'd be crazy not to, Dan.
@matt_gray_ Nice thread, Matt. I appreciate the inclusion here. Keep growing toward 100k!
@_nathanrene Hell yeah. Congrats!
@natolisnuggets You're showing up daily and with good knowledge. Keep it going, man.
@NotionSensei_ Everything worth doing is difficult in practice though.
@dklineii Yep. Go look for gold or sell pick axes.
@writingtoriches Ha. Perfectly stated, Charles.
@JoshuaKatowitz This is such a great comment, Josh.
@SahilBloom You're proving it daily, my man.
@imnotchained 100%, Kamal.
@caitmackcs Agreed. It's a pretty wild time to skip.
@bikenn_njukang Many, many people.
@hi_harshi Perfectly stated.

@gregisenberg A rollercoaster of a Tweet, Greg. You'll be excellent at this. Looking fwd to it.
@SachinRamje Love this man! Thank you.
You can't control a recession.  But you can control building deep expertise in something people desperately need during one.
@PaulMCaffrey I had a panic attack in late 2018 and knew something had to change in my life.
@Austen Button A for me is a no-brainer.  I'd love $10M, but I'm pretty sure if you gave me $1M, I'd have more than a 15% chance of turning it into $10M.
@pbasilstrength Same. There is no better teacher than a bit of failure.
@jasonstrimpel Shipping and getting feedback is the fastest way to get things right.
@ecomEddie For sure. To be clear, they are super valuable.  But it doesn't matter much if you never really get started and learn on your own.
@jjtalentcoach Nearly everything has been independent learning. I've taken 2 online courses in 4 years, and probably read a handful of books, but the time spent pales in comparison to just doing things.
@ChrisTaudien There is no recipe or shortcut. Everyone's journey is very different.
@har8narayan Teach yourself what you can, and then apprentice once you've reached a ceiling.
@Albadawee Thanks, Sohaib!
@SahilBloom It truly does. Taking action is basically business medicine.
@torreydawley Not even close, Torrey.
@philiponfood True story.
@coldwrites There is a ton of value in mentors, peers, articles, etc.   But, in the end you have to start.
@JosephSeifert22 It absolutely is, Joseph.
@theantonioreza Take action, learn, and improve.
My business started growing when I realized that nobody was going to come teach me how to do everything to be successful.  Threads, articles, peers, mentors, colleagues, friends, &amp; family are all great, but in the end, solopreneurs thrive when they start and learn.
Solopreneurship isn't about time, it's about discipline.  - Big goals - Check-in points - Daily action steps  My calendar is 30% regimented and 70% flexible.  Regimented for consistent achievement. Flexible for new opportunities.
@therossmcdaniel Me neither. But there might not be one and that allows us to live our lives more randomly, therefore experiencing more things. Win/Win!
@FitFounder The body and mind both need down time. It's when muscles heal and when the brain incubates interesting ideas.
@therossmcdaniel Definitely. This isn't meant to be binary as though it's either routine or no routine.   It's just about structuring our days to be productive, but remembering that productivity often comes from downtime, incubation of ideas, a change of 
@Char1ieBennett Great comment here, Charlie. Love that.
@gregisenberg They've worked well for me. IPAs get my creative juices flowing (or maybe they are just 7%)
@alananybusiness Sometimes you can't fight an uncreative block.
@HeyJimBurgess It's where my best ideas come from, Jim.
@AdsFunnelSales Smart hack.
@ale_bizpln Agreed 100%, Alejandro.
@theficouple Taking time off is when our brain is incubating new ideas as well.
@theantonioreza It certainly can be, Antonio.
My favorite productivity hack is to stop trying to be productive all of the time.  Humans aren't designed to be productivity machines.  - Vary your routine. - Enjoy a new setting. - Embrace randomness.  You might become more productive anyways.
@Nicolascole77 It's amazing how a dumb thought can become a great article.
@thedankoe It's also worth pointing out that humans aren't really designed to be productivity machines.  One of my favorite "productivity hacks" is to stop trying to be productive all of time.
@agazdecki 2023 Goals.
@KateBour Congratulations, Katelyn!
@ryan_c_walsh I agree 100% with that. Just plain truth, Ryan.
@abhimanyu_b06 Definitely. I've learned much more working for myself. That's the Tweet.
@theficouple That's how I was. It's a great way to start.
@SeanPHogue Likely never.
@jasonstrimpel Chief Everything Officer.
@SahilBloom Damn, ain't this the truth.
@andrewmcbarnett Definitely. People don't realize how hard something is when we move from theorizing it to actually doing it.
@BlackEmpressoff Always.
@ThomasKStrider Seems to work that way for everyone.
@natolisnuggets Always the best route.
I spent 10 years working for entrepreneurs and 3 years being one.   The latter taught me 100x more.

@sweatystartup I was bummed to miss this.  Just snagged a place in Upstate NY.  Next time in the Catskills?
@matt_gray_ Where it Happens by @gregisenberg is a great one too.
@wishdontmatter I actually hit 6-figures on a Carrd website about 2 years ago.   Crazy times.
@HaydnMartin_ I'd rather just have organic conversations. Cheaper and a better chance to learn from prospective customers.
@bryhutch I love that, Bryan.
@SachinRamje That's spot on, Sachin. Go talk to prospects and listen to their problems and needs.
@SahilBloom For sure. So many tools, so many options.
@KreatorKitchen Boom! Love it man.
@JosephSeifert22 100%, Joseph.
@AuthorOnTheSide Exactly.   Unless you just reach out and take the money.
@SahilBloom Check out this @heyartifact to book a full podcast interview and story with your folks.   I just bought this for my parents.
@dennis_geelen The best.
@jasonstrimpel Nailed it :)
Running a one-person business means knowing what not to work on.  And idea validation has never been faster &amp; easier:  - Domain (Google): $12/yr - Website (Carrd): $19/yr - Payment &amp; delivery (Gumroad): Free  Please spend $31 before you build something people don't want or need.
@tibo_maker Great breakdown, Tibo. I appreciate being featured here.   It also acts as a reminder to continue to stay focused on these things that have yielded great results.   Appreciate you.
@creation247 A bigger flex is not finding yourself in that situation in the first place.
@NafetsWirth Because that's one of 5 impostor accounts I have at the moment.
@SahilBloom You're killing it over there
@CSMikeCardona @VineetSinha @rezzz @ericasmyname @aronkor Thank you, Mike!
@Nicolascole77 Writing is just the transfer of that unique information to someone else.
@FitFounder Dude, you're killing it over there (as I knew you would). Not enough fitness content there.
@Nobill_Mic_Hael See ya there.
@AlperenBelgic It might.  But they should see opportunity instead of a reason to leave.
@Char1ieBennett 100%. It's a pride thing for a lot of people...
@DailyValueBot For sure!
@Zak_Klinedinst On Twitter.
@foundersuccess For sure. Same here, Marcus.
@dennis_geelen It's a great place to get started, Dennis.
A lot of Twitter folks hate LinkedIn.  But there is:  - Tons of reach - An appetite for content - A thirst for business knowledge  I've racked up 162.597M+ impressions on LinkedIn.  Tomorrow I'll share my writing process w/ 52,994 subscribers.  Join us:   https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG

@blakeaburge Thank you so much, Blake!
@thedankoe It's amazing what purpose will do for your drive.   Purposeless work, on the other hand, means accomplishing very little at a very slow pace.

@KateBour I've been telling y'all :)
@respectmywrites Thanks, Ken!
@neverproductiv Haha. It's not an "ass".
@JoshuaKatowitz Keep going, Josh. It will feel more and more natural.
@SahilBloom Thanks, man!
@ItsKieranDrew No, it's on Kajabi, but I never recommend that for people just getting started. Carrd is much easier to get traction, and then you can eventually flip to Kajabi when you know you're onto something.

That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Congrats. You just launched a course.  Maybe you won't do $90k.   But you now have an asset that can be purchased 24/7/365 by 4.95B internet-connected people.  Wild.
7. Execute your promotion plan  Start by including the link to the landing page in your social profiles.   Add it to your:  - LinkedIn profile - Twitter profile - Instagram  Then announce on social, your email list, and via any communities that you’re a part of.
6. Build a landing page in Carrd (Optional)  I love building out a robust landing page using Carrd.  Carrd is a simple one-page website builder that costs $19 per year. Yes, you read that right. Per year.  You get a professional-looking landing page that helps improve conversion.
5. Build out your product  Gumroad is a great place to start because it’s fast, cheap, and easy.  Choose your product name, description, &amp; price to get started.  Then head over to Canva to build out a nice product image that represents what people will get when they buy.
4. Pick your promotional channels:  - Social media - Your email list - Any community you’re in  Then, sketch out your promo content:  - Announcement - Reminder - Last call  Make sure your content answers this question:   Why should someone buy this course NOW, during my presale?
3. Create a presale promotional plan:  Next, it’s time to create a promotional plan.  Start by choosing how long your presale will run.  I presold for roughly 30 days because it gave me more time to drum up interest.  Then I offered a 35% discount during the presale.
2. Create course benefits &amp; outcomes:  Here’s what you want to clearly define:  - What specific problem are you solving? - What are the benefits and outcome(s) a student can expect?  Create an outline for your product that:   - Solves #1 - Delivers on #2
1. Choose a topic you can talk about for 30 minutes:  If you can’t talk about a topic for 30 minutes unprepared, you probably don’t know enough for a course.  No research, no reading other people’s takes, no stealing content from blogs.  Just in-depth knowledge.  Choose that.
My last course made $90,351 in 30 days.  Here's the 6-step process I used to launch it:

There are zero get-rich-quick schemes.  If someone is selling you that and you're buying? You're the fool.   Building a business online is a long game.   If you want to play, please have some patience.
@dickiebush Really awesome stuff here, Dickie. Making digital writing a bit more plug and play.
@dickiebush It's weird how the "algorithm" always seems to impact those who don't practice, get feedback, or experiment.
@Nicolascole77 The money is simply an outcome of doing many things well, in aggregate.
@thedankoe Once you've decided you cannot, then you cannot. It's pretty simple.
@agazdecki Every founder should have a deep understanding of both sales and marketing.   These are 2 of the most difficult exec hires to eventually make.
@ItsKieranDrew @IAmZachHackett Yep. I love internet business and digital marketing, so this is fun for me.
@MakadiaHarsh You're living proof, Harsh.
@Gr0wthSyndicate I stick to my topic because I love it.
@JosephSeifert22 Yep. And now you speak to 250 people each day. Most people have never been on a stage in front of that many people in their lives.
@FitFounder Yep. My audience is about the same size as the city I grew up in (Cleveland, Ohio).   Pretty wild.
@abilityimprove Appreciate the mention, Amaan!
@tspeeg Exactly, Tyler.
@foundersuccess It's such a huge win-win, Marcus. You get better and your audience gets better.
@BrianFOConnor Exactly, Brian.
@The_AliQ Interesting. I've never watched any of his stuff, tbh.
@SeanPHogue It's the easiest way to grow and gather at the same time.
@Ashwin_Desh For sure, Ashwin.
Audience Building 101:  1. Pick a topic you're obsessed with.  2. Research it deeply each day.  3. Create content that helps others:  - Interesting observations - Common misconceptions - Step-by-step breakdowns - What will change in 5 years  An audience will naturally gather.
@jayclouse @TomFrankly @JamesClear @herfirst100K @AliAbdaal Excellent thread, Jay.   I feel so fortunate to have been a guest. Thanks again for having me.   What an incredibly bright future (and present) you have. 🔥
@dvassallo I wish I wasn't selling my house at this exact moment. 😒
@dvassallo We had very similar problems in Nashville.  We couldn't get anyone to come to our house to do anything.  While they have leverage today, this will ebb and flow, as it always does.  Businesses that navigate this period effectively will thrive wh
@jappleby 😂
@jappleby If you move to LinkedIn, where will you learn about 10 free websites everyone should know (#8 is so good, it should be illegal!)
@darentsmith @jspector Same. I just post at times that are good for me and assume that high quality content will resonate regardless of time posted.
@petergyang So glad you enjoyed it (and learned some things).
Part of solopreneurship is integrating revenue into your daily lifestyle.  Write email sequences? Monetize that. Project manage something? Monetize it. Delivering a newsletter? Get paid for it.  If you're already doing something, always think creatively to attach income to it.
@ryanpaulgibson I did invest a little in early 2022, but just in getting my website moved to a new platform and cleaned up.  Social has been great, so I don't really regret not doing it sooner, but maybe :)
@matt_gray_ Great visuals here!
@AlexAndBooks_ Thanks for the feature, my man. Some ones in here I'm totally unaware of.  Appreciate it.
@Walter_Haydock Social content: Twitter post, LinkedIn post, etc.  Organic: Articles that live on a website and generate organic traffic via search engines
@thedankoe We're being shepherded into groups based on what we believe, when they best thing for most people is likely a blend.
@jackbutcher Everything looks easy until you're the one doing it.
@girish1729 @TheHanae @thedankoe Thanks, Girish
@gneuman Love that, Gabriel.
@farez Sweet. I hope to be one.
@tomosman Thank you, Tom. Hope you're well brother.
@johncdrilling Totally. Love it, John.
@jappleby Sweet. Thanks, Jack.
@woodwardoge I don't actually have a great example.   I'm hoping to be one.
@ryandeniswalker On it, Ryan.
@simplemanguide @dwilliamriggs Cool. Interviewing SEOs.
@TheMBA_coach Awesome. Thanks, AShley.
@foundersuccess Cool. Thanks, Marcus.
You can build a high-growth, one-person business through the combo of social &amp; organic search.  - Social: quick spikes, declines fast - Organic: slow-building, grows over time  In 2023 I'll invest $30k+ in SEO to augment my social.  Would a public-facing dashboard be interesting?
@WrongsToWrite @aaditsh @therealbmark @andrehaykaljr @OneJKMolina @LoftedLearning @blackhatwizardd @Shane___Martin @SeanAnthonySays @ecomchasedimond Thank you so much, Dakota.  Really appreciate you including me on this list.  🙌
@jayclouse @sivers Wow. What a guest man. Maybe my favorite author. Congrats on the big interview.
Everyone has unique knowledge.  Here's how to sell it:  - All at once: A course - Dripped over time: A subscription - Discussed with other people: A private community - Learned with other people: Cohort-based coaching  One set of knowledge.  A diverse set of revenue options.
Something you can "do in your sleep" is worth $10k+ to someone else.
@claytonchambrs Just left!
@HouseHunter216 I-O
@stepanhlinka Ok. Votes are in and it's you, brother.  Thanks for the massive mention.  Your growth is insane. Keep up the great work!
@lilmac024 Haha. Appreciate you, man. :)
@stepanhlinka Appreciate it :)   I just got done with an 8-hour drive and had 4k new Twitter followers. I think you're the reason.  Amazing!   Keep going, brother.
@thatroblennon Feel like just driving back and forth across state lines then.
@jawnquincyadams I just saw this, but 4,000 seems like a lot. Could be though!

One-person diversified media companies are the new modern business.  Grow a social channel, build a large email list, and then offer multiple products at multiple price points:  - Subscriptions - Sponsorships - Coaching - Affiliates - Courses - Etc.  Tiny business. Big revenue.

@schlaf It's a total unlock when you realize this.  It gives you permission to try things that you don't believe you are qualified for.   And even if you "fail" you still fail forward.
@GreenHamoon Mostly below average.
@MalkanKaya Absolutely, Kaya.
@dennis_geelen For sure, Dennis.
The most permission-inducing realization I've ever had is that my business heroes are average people.

@dennis_geelen This is awesome, Dennis.
@FitFounder I'm all about diversification over "eggs in one basket" mentality.
@AlexandraAllen_ Awesome. I would love if the issue had a major impact on women founders. That would be fantastic!
@johncdrilling I've had nice coaches on my journey, so I try and provide the same service for others.

@myown_techbrand @arvidkahl I didn't mean the founder personally. I meant their business.
3 big problems Solopreneurs face:  1.  They build unscalable businesses 2. They miss obvious revenue opportunities 3. They don't diversify their income streams  Tomorrow, I'm going to share a plan to analyze and fix all 3 issues.  Join 51,789 readers here:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG

I'll cross 350M+ social media impressions for my business in 2022.  And all I do is share 2 thoughts per day on 2 social channels.  Imagine not taking advantage of this time we're in.  You owe it to your future business to start sharing right now.
@dickiebush Every great writer needs a great warm up. Enjoyed this one, Dickie.
@LoftedLearning Absolutely.   I wasn't suggesting this was an optimal plan, but simply that people toss their hat in the ring and get started in any way, shape, or form.
@JoshuaKatowitz 100%, Josh. That's a very valid point.
@shushant_l All of those things require starting, which is what I'm advocating for here. Most people will research and research and research.  It's great to get in the game to start understanding it.
@TizzieHerman Ideas are a dime a dozen.
@johncdrilling Just get started with the most simple tools and get more complex over time.
@acagamic Of course. But if you're really an entrepreneur, you'll build 100 airplanes in your time.   You likely won't spend your entire life researching how to build one perfectly.
@CompoundingCed Whatever you already know how to use.
@sachdevasampark Literally, the best.
@YasshhTilekar You have to. Learning comes with action.
@gethebizz Nailed it.
Imagine that instead of researching your idea, designing a logo, trialing 7 tools, and talking to 10 friends, you just built a simple landing page and started promoting your business and the problem it solves.  You might fail, but you'll learn 1000x faster than procrastinating.

@theantonioreza I learned them in my late 30s. All good!
@foundersuccess That's the great part, Marcus.
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
I wrote about these 5 rules at a much deeper level here.  If you want to build a slightly different life, give it a read.  (read time: 4 minutes)   https://t.co/FCFrMMXCv8
5/ Increase yourself  Front-load effort to build products that pay you in a recurring fashion.  With each purchase, the hours you spent building equal out to a higher hourly rate.  Build once, sell one thousand times.
4/ Replicate yourself  Creating an online business means taking advantage of global E-commerce, which is absolutely wild.  The assets that you create are available all over the world, 24 hours a day, to those 4.95B internet-connected people.  Those assets live forever.
3/ Invest in yourself  The amount of internet tools available to people has never been more open and available.  You can build your entire tech stack (landing page, email automation, blogging, products) on sites like Gumroad for free.  Build a toolset that allows you to thrive.
2/ Diversify yourself  We're all familiar with the phrase, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket", but that is precisely what the average person does with their income.  Diversify the way you earn:  - Coaching - Courses - Community - Subscriptions - Sponsors - SaaS
1/ Scale yourself  It's important to find a way to move from earning 33% of the day (9 to 5) to earning 100% of the day.  "You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. An army of robots is freely available..."  - Naval
Working 60 hours per week for 45 years is a tough pill to swallow.  Instead, think about your life using these 5 new rules:
@fitwithrashid Wow. I absolutely love that sentence. Great share here, Rashid.
@dennis_geelen So glad it was a massive win for you, my man. Kudos to you for the amazing book. Cheers, Dennis.
It's difficult to build a work ethic without the right environment.  While everyone talks about "hard work" and "outworking the competition", it's tough to force this behavior.  Curate a high-performance environment and the behavior is a more likely outcome.
@matt_gray_ Nice thread here, Matt.  I'm going deep on SEO next month to start diversifying from social.
@KrisOgrabek Thanks, Kris!
@TheMBA_coach Nailed it here, Ashley.
@Ashwin_Desh It sure does, Ashwin.
@theficouple Love that last line. Smart.
Stop searching for a mentor.  Instead, attract a high-quality mentor by making yourself someone worth spending time on.
@schlaf @sivers Have you read his new book? 🤌🏻
@jjeffrose Love this, Jeff. Thanks for the mention!

@Dylan_Secrest It certainly is, Dylan.
@ThomasKStrider True story, Thomas.
@Zbijelic Same.
The daily news is miserable.  So I surround myself with:  - Great books - High performers - Uplifting podcasts - A positive Twitter audience  I'm going to brainwash myself before the world can.
@blakeaburge There is a really great book that talks about this called, "The Second Mountain" by David Brooks.
@matt_gray_ "The Super Bowl is won in the preseason." - I love that, Matt.
@Kyler_Nixon I just present the option in the course and provide simple talking points. Nothing too complicated tbh.
@30DayThrill Correct!
@telmeri Average Revenue Per User

@kaolti That's the game.
@aadifernandes Appreciate it, Aadi.
@dennis_geelen Thanks, Dennis!
Just crossed $1.5M in online course sales at a $130.25 ARPU.  Turns out, not everything has to be high-ticket.  Until you build tremendous social capital, I'd recommend keeping it affordable and high-quality.  Build that trust and play the long game.

@jspector @ngerdau My man 🙌 Congratulations ❤️
@thisiskp_ @AlexHormozi Thank you, man!   I appreciate that so much.
@DanielRSchatzl It depends on what you mean by leads, but I drive about 1,000 unique visitors to my course landing pages each day.
@acapland Mine is around 3.5%, yes.
@_robwilloughby I'm so glad man!
@ThomasKStrider Thank you!
If you can find a way to drive 100 people to a landing page each day, you can probably make 2-3 sales of a lower-cost product.  If that product is $150, you're making $100k+ per year.  Become known for one thing, build one product, and drive that traffic.  Start there.
@dickiebush 3 Coffees. Check.
@austinbelcak I became a solopreneur to spend more time with my wife. I don't need to build a unicorn to do that.
@thedankoe Not only is it fulfilling, but the lessons learned on an unpredictable path are so valuable.
@aaditsh Most people look to others for permission or validation, when taking action and letting the market tell you, is the best way forward.
@blakeaburge @inboundrevenue I think you just stumbled onto a new paid product, Blake.
@blakeaburge Sweet. Will text you :)
@FitFounder Yep.  My goal is to reduce misery and increase satisfaction.
@blakeaburge I'd love to build a business dashboard in Excel - Got anything for that?
@CheetSheets For sure.   Much more flexible.
@KalimoLeboela Love that, Kalimo.
@TheMBA_coach Saving money is me playing defense.  Continuing to invest in audience + community + products is playing offense.  I like a combination of both.
@dennis_geelen Keep going, Dennis!
@SahilBloom For sure.  Holding on to my preferred lifestyle is both motivating and drives a bit of fear.
@MarleyMcBride_ I'll take it.
@NiharikaSodhi Same. That would be taking this lifestyle away!
@matt_gray_ Probably my main driver.
@gillianography We all are.
@wishdontmatter Just all of my customers. That would be odd though!
@thechrisbaumann That's it right there.
@OzolinsJanis Glad it resonates with people, Janis!
@shushant_l Thanks, Shushant. I hope so.
My biggest motivation as a solopreneur is never having this lifestyle taken away from me.
@Zbijelic Appreciate that, man.  What's your favorite?
@JoshuaKatowitz So natural, and works so much better, Josh.
@SeanPHogue Same, Sean.
@KateBour Thank you, Katelyn. Funny enough, I think we all start this way. Just some of us eventually find our own path.

@Zbijelic Thank you, brother. Much appreciated.
@oseikodie_ Appreciate it!
@jaxx_sam Thanks!
Read the entire breakdown here:   https://t.co/U3KyElDKvi
I wrote about how to build a one-person business that stands out in the sea of sameness.   It has 4 parts:  1. Embrace Your Obsession 2. Develop Unique Knowledge 3. Build Distribution By Studying People 4. Scale Using Compounding, Daily Media
Most people fail at distribution because they copy what they see popular accounts doing online, but without the benefit of years of work and brand recognition.
@devinmcpaul Thank you! I'll take "menace" :)
@GabeMarusca Thanks, Gabe!
@thedankoe The more I've done things to impress others, the less impressed I am with myself.
@IAmZachHackett That's 100% true. People share systems with me all of the time.  I take them and make them my own by transforming them into things that actually work for me.
@thechrisbaumann Love that, Chris.
@SahilBloom Agreed. It's about understanding that all advice requires context.
@aadifernandes Exactly, Aadi.
@FitFounder Exactly, man.  Use it, but be aware of how different journey's go.
@bewritethere A lot of people are really looking for:  - permission - validation - feedback
@TheAmineAouragh Correct. Too much copy/paste of advice rather than realizing it requires context.
@natolisnuggets This is an excellent comment, Ant.
@darentsmith @sivers That's right. All advice requires a tremendous amount of context.
@mkhundmiri @justinmooretfam @arvidkahl @KateBour Appreciate it, Mustafa.   Just crossed 51k subs this morning 💪
I try to share the best advice I have with other solopreneurs.  But you shouldn't follow anyone's advice (mine included) blindly only to find out that their luck, timing, or privilege isn't on your side.  Advice is more of a guidepost, and less of a treasure map.

@Nicolascole77 "The road to hell is paved with adverbs." 😂  Brilliant.
@Kebiru_Momodu_ Always, Kay.
@aaditsh Absolutely.
@s4m4rn0ld Haha. True story :)
@DivvyUp_King @HeroJourneyOn If nobody wants to listen, they won't. The market works well that way!
Potential unpopular opinion, but telling people they shouldn't share on social media unless they have a bunch of experience misses the whole point. The market decides who to listen to, not some preconceived notion of what a successful person looks like.
@dickiebush While I don't technically journal daily, I do share my thoughts into the world. Such clarification from doing so.
@TMitrosilis Gong and Outreach are pretty masterful at it, IMO.
@iamtomelliot @agazdecki I always liked hiring people who had actively taken part in building early-stage startups rather than people who had spent many years at mature companies.
@Nicolascole77 Read it out loud. If it doesn't sound like you, write it again.
@SahilBloom Brussel Sprouts.
@thedankoe And the best way to do this is t o surround yourself with a diverse crew of artists, entrepreneurs and athletes.
@agazdecki Early-stage startups especially. So many of them hire optimizers rather than builders. In the beginning, nearly everyone has to be a builder.
@TMitrosilis Their whole executive team should be online. Some companies are masterful at this.
@FitFounder 127% more fulfilling.
@worth_parker I love to hear it man!
@The_Skill_Lab 1. Unimportant obligations 2. I'd have hired a VA sooner 3. Keep tools and tech simple
@IAmZachHackett Thank you, Zach!
@har8narayan Probably not. I'd like to just make what I made this year, but work less.
@ItsKieranDrew I love that I have very few obligations!
@foundersuccess Get fit. Give a lot of money away. Feed hungry people for the holidays.
@LBacaj That's right. I can get a small raise by writing an email.
@shushant_l Thanks, Shushant!
@The_Skill_Lab 1. Writing well 2. Consistency
@matt_gray_ Thank you brother.
@SahilBloom True story. Stuff is getting outta control.
@matt_gray_ Congrats on the great growth, man.
@KateBour I'm his favorite employee. That's the secret.
My raises as an employee:  2017: 4% 2018: 5% 2019: 7%  My raises as a solopreneur:  2020: 10% 2021: 40% 2022: 127%

What's a book nobody talks about, that every entrepreneur should read?
@imjeremiahrizzo @amandanat Haha.
@amandanat "I'm a one-man $20M machine!"   Oh yeah - why does your website have 45 employees?  "I just cracked $2M this year!"  Why does your Stripe screenshot say $127k?  "I grew the business from $0 to $40M ARR!"  You joined at $30M, I can see it on you
@dennis_geelen Thanks, brother.  A small thank you note was the least I could do, ya know?
@amandanat I don't actually look for proof that they are credible.  Instead, I look for obvious lies.  "I spent 5,000 hours studying landing pages last year..."  Oh yeah? 13 hours a day, every single day of the year?  Cool story dude.
@HeyMohit_ He certainly is a good one.
@MalkanKaya Agreed, Kaya.

Floyd Mayweather on the power of the creator:  “I can fight a fighter right now &amp; guarantee myself $35M. Or me and Logan Paul can go out, entertain, have fun &amp; make $100M or more."   "$35M for 12 rounds or $100M for 6 rounds — big difference.”  Attention pays.

@tashfene That's right, Tashfeen,
@andrewglynch It's good to start by focusing on one, but if it's easy enough to distribute, go for it.
@TheMBA_coach For sure, Ashley. The easiest way.
A simple way to find customers:  - Write an article for your website - Chop it up &amp; put it on LinkedIn - Double it up on Twitter - Use it to answer questions on Quora &amp; IndieHackers  Look for which channel brings some in high-quality prospects.  Then double down and repeat.

@schlaf I love to hear it, Steve. Congrats, my man.  Looking fwd to spending some time together in NY and jamming out on some business ideas.
@thedankoe The less you spend inside of the tactical part of your business, the more time you can spend "big picture thinking".  Love that one.
How to think of a business idea:  1. Difficult way: Think of a product  2. Better way: Solve your own problem  3. Best way: Design a category where you're the winner  You can win with all of these, but number 3 is key for creator-entrepreneurs.
@WillC69927069 Everything is easier said than done.   Is there anything worth doing that's super easy?

How to write unique content for your niche:  - What is something everyone believes, that you don't? - What is something nobody is talking about but should be? - What are big mistakes people make, that they are oblivious to? - What change is happening that people aren't noticing?

@mkhundmiri @clichekajal This looked like a dope Tweet! :)
@noahzender If churn becomes high or your product is deemed low priority (demand in market shifts or recession) it's nice to have additional streams.  This is why I have one-time products, and the upsell to MRR. Gives me flexibility for sure.
@ItsKieranDrew I agree with this.   Trade your time for money until you deeply understand customer problems.  Then address them with a product.

@dickiebush My wife and I do the same for small business owners until we know them by name.  My buddy taught me this with bartenders in NYC.   Lots of free drinks :)
@thedankoe Seeing small actions result in big outcomes over time is one of the most gratifying experiences there is.
@KateBour Building your business is a lot like standup comedy.  When you start, you mimic and imitate your favorites.  It's once you find your true voice and path, that speaks to your specific customers, then you truly shine.
@Nicolascole77 Haha. Best comment.
@Nicolascole77 It's also really useful to go back and read critical points in time and milestones hit. You'll start to see that the best outcomes were often a result of many good things strung together.
@SahilBloom That's it right there.  Find the 20% and go wild.

You aren't rewarded for hard work.  You're rewarded for creating something of value.  So don't work unnecessarily hard on something that you haven't validated people want.  Instead, run small experiments over &amp; over again until you have a few strong outcomes.  Then double down.
@joserosado Stay safe, my man. Fingers crossed hard on this one.
@Avishai_Bitton Sure. Slice and dice it however.  Just one of a million ways to hit the target.
@mkhundmiri "I tried for a day and it didn't work."
@madsbrodt Exactly.  Million ways to get there!
@YasshhTilekar It is.
@remotejoeclark I have tons of free guides and advice on audience building on my website.  There's so many different plays you can run.  Check it out:  https://t.co/64c9clrgk7
@keyurkumbhare Exactly.
@aadifernandes True story.
@tspeeg Break big goals into small chunks and everything becomes easier.
@natolisnuggets Of course you can.  You already are.
There are 4,950,000,000 internet-connected people.  Can you find 4 each day that will pay you $70?  If so, you have a $100k business.  Definitely not easy, but also not as daunting as you might think.

@GrammarHippy Words make sales.
@FitFounder Thanks for having me on, man! Good times :)
@blakeaburge Procrastination, while challenging, can also be a feature rather than a bug.  Often, it's good to listen to it. Interested to give this a read, Blake.
@Nicolascole77 One more to think about:  Incentivize: Make your customer base your biggest and most motivated sales team.  You'll have a lot less work to do.
@austinbelcak I noticed that "mass applying via Indeed" isn't included.
@thedankoe "I tried it once and it didn't work so you're wrong."
@CheetSheets So nice to see I'm one of them. Thanks!
@SamuelBriskar Ha. Thank you!
@Jon_Finkel Ha. Nice. Batting 1.000 over here.
@thealexbanks Hope they are helpful, Alex!
@copyandcheese WElcome, Ricardo.
@FitFounder Nice. Glad it was helpful, Dan.
@blakeaburge @followerwonk Welcome!
@CharfaouiYounes @TwemexApp Game changer.
@SahilBloom Lol. You don't need them! :)
@matt_gray_ It's a real nice feature, Matt.
@ComplicatedIsOK @matt_gray_ @afigueiredo It's not luck to build something that aligns with your values. It's action and risk.
@francis_oleh Glad they are helpful, Francis.
@Nailingthreads @followerwonk WElcome!
@simonholdorf Thanks for reading it, Simon.
That's a wrap! I hope you have a wonderful Sunday.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
10/ Hide Twitter Trends  Twitter trends are usually negative.  And they can be distracting and detrimental to your mental health.  Unless you install "Hide Twitter Trends".  This plugin will let you focus and regain your sanity by hiding the trends section.  Highly recommend.  https://t.co/PpSZZ7t0ch
9/ Mute conversations  Ever get mentioned in a tweet &amp; you start getting hundreds of notifications?  It clogs up your whole notification feed.  Expand the details of the tweet and click the 3 dots on the top right-hand corner.  Then, click "mute this conversation."  https://t.co/vmmn47PEFl
8/ Creating powerful lists  Lists are a powerful way to organize a relevant Twitter ecosystem.  Just create your lists and add your people.  Once you do, you can visit lists to see all relevant Tweets from that group.  Great for groups, local meetups, and any other organization.  https://t.co/J1OqDHGvc2
7/ Bookmark folders  Want to save and organize your favorite Tweets?  With @TwitterBlue you can build out an entire file cabinet of bookmarks.  Just sign up, build out your folders, and get saving.  https://t.co/i1ISqYbusZ
6/ Personal Twitter CRM  Struggle to remember everyone's kid's names?   Or maybe how you met? Or if someone introduced you?  @blackmagic_so also has built-in CRM functionality.  Never forget another important detail.  https://t.co/DR6eUoyiBi
5/ Hyper-fast engagement  Engaging with top accounts is crucial.  I use @blackmagic_so to create my list of important accounts.  It shows me how many Tweets I've missed from them.  Then, 2x per day, I engage at hyper-speed to keep growing.  You can do it right from the sidebar!  https://t.co/BXL7s1xLJI
4/ Auto-plugging for subscribers  @Hypefury will also auto-plug your newsletter.  - Select the number of likes/engagements. - Create your custom message to add-on  Voila.  If your post reaches the threshold, it will auto-plug your newsletter.  Great for products/services too.  https://t.co/cpwwvzCpbM
3/ Auto-retweeting for growth  The shelf-life of a Tweet is about 24 hours.  One great way to get more engagement is to Retweet yourself.  I RT myself 9 hours later using @hypefury  The best part? They Un-Retweet 24 hours later.  That keeps your profile nice and clean.  https://t.co/O9A7ec4LLJ
2/ Most active times  It's best to Tweet when your followers are online.  Do you know when they are most active?  Twitter doesn't tell you, but @Followerwonk does  Get more engagement with better timing.  https://t.co/TWP6DRSn8A
1/ Most popular Tweets  Ever wanted to find someone's most popular Tweets of all time?  Or maybe their most popular recent Tweets?  Install @TwemexApp and instantly find them all.  https://t.co/i41srFW358
10 powerful little Twitter hacks every user should know:
@matt_gray_ Once people determine their brand values, it's critical to actually live them.  So many values exist on paper but not in practice.

@NikolaosNtirlis @amandanat Ahhh. Definitely wasn’t doing that 😂
@R_ubenBuijs Nope.
@supermode_ @barrettjoneill Not sure there’s a one-size-fits-all answer. Experiment and see what works. Could be 4 months or a year!
@amandanat Haha. I don’t even know what that means
@Mekdadbakr Thank you :) I appreciate that!
@SteveOnSpeed I'm glad it's resonating!
@MichealGreen Thanks, man!
@AlexAndBooks_ I just started but I'm enjoying the clarity with which he describes where I'm at in my life and what my purpose is.
@theactionpod @AlexAndBooks_ I just started it and I'm really enjoying it.
@thedankoe Do the opposite of what everyone does and get the opposite of what everyone gets.  It's so obvious that it isn't.
@AlexAndBooks_ Have you read The Second Mountain by David Brooks, Alex?
@agazdecki Haha. This is how I feel daily about my little one-person business. 😂
@pbasilstrength For sure. I've needed to hear the same stuff about 100 times before I start taking action sometimes.
@UnderstoryBard Agreed. I repurpose emails every once in a while as well.
@AshwinMStanley I'm sure lots of people do. But I don't need to hit a home run with every post. Just small, compound returns over time.
@AnderrDavib Eso es correcto. Y hace que escribir contenido sea mucho más fácil.
@theandreboso I surely did.
@hi_harshi Haha. Thanks! :)
@blakeaburge Work it until it's beat!
@dklineii That's what I think as well, Dave...
@HeyAmna1 Exactly. It takes a long time for these messages to resonate.
@Johnson_AsiNG That's it!
@prodHackers Exactly.
@Kebiru_Momodu_ For sure, Kay. Especially when you've been cranking out content for years.
@BryceWGarcia So easy.
@thearjunmitra Thanks, Arjun!
If you're publishing content daily, remember:  - 75% of your followers didn't see it - 80% of your followers won't remember - 100% of your new followers never saw it  Tweak and repurpose your best stuff often.  Nobody remembers your content like you remember your content.
@blakeaburge This is super helpful as I plan my financial systems for 2023. Thanks, brother!
@jappleby @hutchison15 I just started here, honestly:   https://t.co/TmgRZw1CB2
@blakeaburge How do you learn new stuff about this every single week? It's pretty wild honestly.
@matt_gray_ Glad to be a part of the team, my man. 📈
@darentsmith @jspector @sivers Thank you, Daren.   To be clear, I’m a huge fan of Derek and he’s the entrepreneur I aspire to be. His books are the best out there IMO.   Thanks for the mention in the same sentence.
@jappleby @hutchison15 Hey Jack - I felt the same way about Notion for awhile.   Then I just started using it, testing out free templates, trashing what didn’t feel right, etc.   Eventually it became my go to for everything. X
@JamesonCamp I'm moving upstate (Hudson Valley) in 8 weeks. I'll be in the city often.   Beers?
@ryanvdreyer Congrats!
@selfautonomy Thank you so much for this, man.   Truly honored and humbled.   I appreciate you.
@SteveOnSpeed Thanks for the mention here, Steve. Greatly appreciated!
@ryanvdreyer @dickiebush Nice! We love Shelby Park (I live around the corner) but we're leaving Nashville for Hudson Valley, NY.  Time to hit the mountains :)
@ryanvdreyer @dickiebush So glad you picked up the course, Ryan. I hope it's super helpful to you. 🙏🏻
@IAmZachHackett Thank you, Zach!
@shushant_l All goals can be great, my man.
@CheetSheets Thank you!
@lloydjamesross Thanks, Lloyd!
@j_mmyc See ya there, Jimmy.
@hey_dhruv I think so, Dhruv.
In 2020, I created 5 rules for my life:  - Scale myself - Diversify myself - Invest in myself - Replicate myself - Increase myself  Tomorrow, I'll be breaking them down for 49,567 people in my newsletter:    https://t.co/X3l2wg6fme

You make a lot of money by doing one thing really well.  You keep your money by diversifying down the road.
@iameddyhood Thanks for being a customer, Eddy. I hope you enjoy it!
@SimonJalbert Right now my margins are around 95% or so.
@timgabedesign Anywhere between 90%-95% works well for me.  A combo of courses and other revenue streams that don't require time for money.
@Saamu_Eleja Selling consulting services back in 2020.
@QuinnOaks @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Appreciate it, Quinn!
@joshdviner Appreciate it, Josh. I haven't gotten there yet :)
@thealibilawal Thank you brother!
@Yannick_Veys Thanks, my man.
@bewritethere Dunno yet!
@SahilBloom Thanks. Trying to get to meeting zero.
@Permahues I run on 95% margins currently, doing about $1.8M per year.
@schlaf They for sure will be. I'll be there in (hopefully) 6 weeks or so.
@DmytroKrasun Already working on it.
@OneJKMolina 3-day obligated workweeks.   2 days I have off will definitely be me working on things I want to without any obligations.
@KateBour Thank you, Katelyn!
@FitFounder I'll keep ya posted!
@gregisenberg Let's do it!
@victor_bigfield Same. And I'm moving to Upstate NY
@drrckcnnr Thanks, Fozzye.
@glenn_leese I love it too. Trust me though, every once in a while I sit and watch startups grow with envy.   Sometimes I miss that past life.   But I love the one-person business more!
@DanKulkov That's my goal. Nailed it there, Dan :)
@mgolteez Thanks, Matt!
@JustinWise Thanks, Justin :)
@TheDannyNaz I'll keep ya posted, Danny!
@theficouple Nice! That's amazing, guys. Keep it up.
@TheCoolestCool I'm almost there now. My "No" templates are getting worn out.
@thesandeep_nair Thanks, Sandeep!
@aadifernandes Unlikely, but that's the fun part.
@hey_dhruv It's a goal. Who knows if I'll reach it of course.
@natolisnuggets I'll keep ya posted.
My 2023 solopreneur goals:  - 3-day workweeks - Less than 2 meetings/week - Generate over $3M in revenue - 10+ hours walking/hiking per week - Write a book on one-person business - Help 20k+ people make their first $1 online - Create &amp; grow a small group of entrepreneurs
@FitFounder @SahilBloom Thank you my man. So appreciative 🙌🏻
@jspector Thanks for having me, Josh!
@KateBour How to build a customer journey.
@818Nikkayo Something weird happened.
@SeanPHogue It's generally quite helpful :)
4 phases of Solopreneurship:  1) Get paid to accumulate professional skills  2) Use those skills to solve workplace problems  3) Monetize those professional skills on the side  4) Use the earnings to become a solopreneur
@wes_kao I remember talking to you about Maven before Maven even had a name.  Big things in your future, Wes. Congrats!
@AlexAndBooks_ My man. Thank you so much for the kind plug. I appreciate that!
@KateBour And other people, just like them, who have found your solution to be the best answer to their problems.
@blakeaburge Same :)
@CheetSheets Super fast if you figure it out.
@pauldm I love that "escape route" term, Paul.
@matt_gray_ Haha. You and Sahil on the "luck surface area" train today.
@SahilBloom One of my favorite terms!
@WithNachit Same thing.
@SimonJalbert Almost zero.
@shushant_l Nailed it, Shushant.
@IAmZachHackett 100%. An asset you control.
@aadifernandes Thanks, Aadi.
You can't control inflation or being laid off.  But you can control how you're perceived in the world, and in turn, how many new opportunities come your way in the future.  If you're not sharing your knowledge and learnings online, the time to start is right now.
@matt_gray_ @gregisenberg I'm writing it as we speak.
@matt_gray_ Appreciate the shout out here, Matt!

Who has the best personal website you've seen?
@TheCoolestCool I see it every single day.  Highly talented people with impostor syndrome...
@TheCoolestCool 100%. Wrote about this last week actually:   https://t.co/WaCrXgyN13
@PointONoReturn Easier than ever. 100%.
@Kebiru_Momodu_ A few rungs above on the ladder of knowledge.
@jarrylew True story, man.
Everyone has knowledge that other people will pay for:  The idea that you have to be an "expert" or have a certificate to teach or sell something is a fallacy.  Expertise is linear.   You can make a living helping those 2-3 steps earlier in the journey than you.
@SachinRamje Congrats on the launch, Sachin!
@martinmcfadden_ @dickiebush Yeah, you're probably right.
@thedankoe Very similar to how I write my newsletter:  - Here's the problem - Here's why people fail - Here's what I would do differently - Here's some proof that it works well - Here's a summary or recap of the issue  Process.
@dickiebush Do you think this starts to change over time as people realize they aren't always getting a "secret" or that nothing potentially interesting is being "revealed"?  Would be curious to get your take, Dickie.
@Nicolascole77 The plan is simple.  Less than 1% of people who read this Tweet will actually do it.  And they'll be the ones who land clients.
@SahilBloom And to think I was going to skip carbs today.
@thedankoe It's always weird to me that people feel the need to finish a book they don't enjoy.  Start.  If it doesn't intrigue you? Stop.
@agazdecki Out of the weeds as fast as possible.   I made this mistake early on as CRO.
@KateBour It's a great question. I talk to so many solopreneurs who have never surveyed their customers or analyzed their email/DM.  Weird. That's where the gold is at.
@AmeetM For sure.  I'm working with vendors for my house, so upfront pricing is tricky.  But when I ask for pricing it's a lot of hemming and hawing, then telling me why it's "so high" before I even tell them I think it's high (I don't).  So, now I just l
@robhoffman20 That's right, Rob.
@SahilBloom I get asked about it a lot.  I'll turn that into a newsletter here soon. Thanks, dude.
@josuaio You're forgiven.
@UnderstoryCopy The latter is so true.
@CopyIcon Definitely. Get a bunch of testimonials and results.  Then? Be confident.
@alexaom6_ Price what you'd feel comfortable paying and then say it confidently.  Test that over several calls. If you lose every deal, it's too high (or something else is off). If you win too often, it's too low.
@tashinga360 I'm not necessarily talking about earlier/later. When it comes time to say it, just say it confidently.
@glenn_leese Same here, Glenn.
@TheMBA_coach The most powerful.
@shushant_l This is asesome, Shushant.
@hey_dhruv Exactly. I don't need a 10-minute explanation.
@natolisnuggets It's amazing how many people launch into 10-minute diatribes about why they price themselves the way they do...
It's amazing how many people can't confidently present me their pricing.  Say your price and be quiet.  You'll close a lot more business that way.
@rickvaz @IndieHackers About 95% margins. So, most of it.
@jasonstrimpel Boom! Love to see it, Jason.  Hope you're enjoying the new version.
@KateBour Thank you so much, Katelyn. Right back at you!
@Josh_G_Roth @paulsalamanca @TomBoccard Appreciate you, brother. Hope you're well!
@deysonortiz This is awesome. Thanks!
@NHammondDesign @IndieHackers @ship30for30 Appreciate it, Nick!
@wes_kao @IndieHackers Thanks, Wes!
@matt_gray_ @IndieHackers Appreciate it, brother.
@crackthec0de01 @IndieHackers Thank you!
@tashinga360 @IndieHackers Appreciate it!
@ecomchasedimond @IndieHackers Thank you, brother!
@Zbijelic @IndieHackers Thanks, Zlatko!
Thanks to @IndieHackers for the nice write-up today.  Come learn a little about my $135k/month business:   https://t.co/HJE4nsaZXn
@KellyAnnMorris I do often.  I also have something really cool planned for the holiday season...
@hayden_flohr @thatroblennon @ItsKieranDrew Thank yoU!
@OneJKMolina Gonna be a cohort-based coaching program.
@vegardwikeby Thank you so much, man.  Never makes it any easier to hit publish for me though :)
@heyahmed0 Total permission to let go and move forward any way I chose.

@609media_com Thanks, Megan!
@FitFounder Exactly. She's the whole "why" behind my change.
@stepanhlinka I've found the opposite to be true.  I've found that most people don't have the social capital to pull off high-ticket, so they try and fail.  I'm sure there are exceptions, of course.  I've done over $2M at an ARPU of $130.
@coreyhearne Thanks, Corey!
@Kebiru_Momodu_ Thanks for reading it, Kay.
@stepanhlinka Love this addition, Stepan.
@Dat_CharleyGuy Welcome!
@victor__nnamani Thanks for giving it a read, Victor.
@aadifernandes It's good to diversify but it's also nice to understand one platform deeply before you move to another.
@BrianFOConnor It's a mix I enjoy but also one that requires me to keep producing.
@victor_ukwuaba Yep. It's right there waiting for us.
@SeanPHogue The more simple you make things, the better off you are. There's always time to complicate things later down the line if need be.
@abhishekshah173 That's a great addition, Abhishek.
@AuthorOnTheSide I did for a while and now I can't stop :)
@sscustomdigital Welcome.
@nerita_ll Thanks, Nerita!
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
15/ Remember  In the end, I remembered that life is short.  Too many days in front of the computer means too few days with my beautiful wife.  The computer, business, revenue, and social media will always be there.  Our precious time with loved ones will not.  Remember that.
14/ Seek  To better broaden my worldview, I also sought out those who think differently about the world than I do.  - Different politics - Different cultures - Different viewpoints  It was enriching &amp; allowed me to empathize with people I normally wouldn't.  Conversation &gt; news
13/ Relax  Back in 2020, I felt frustrated by social media.  I was succeeding in building my network and businesses, but politics &amp; the world were upsetting.  So, in 2021, I turned it all off.   Eliminated Twitter trends. Blocked news sites.  Talk about relaxing.
12/ Eliminate  In balancing my businesses, I was doing a lot of things I didn't like doing.  So, I just started saying no to things I didn't enjoy.  The easiest way for me to do this was with "No" templates.  Shout out to @thepatwalls for his "How to Say No" series.  Lifesaver.
11/ Diversify  Until late 2021, I was on one social platform: LinkedIn  I had grown to 275k+ followers but had always felt a bit timid on Twitter.  10 months ago, I decided to just go for it.  The result? 185k followers interested in my journey.  Diversify where you create.
10/ Listen  My business really started taking off when I remembered that my customers tell me what to create next.  Instead of building what I wanted, I asked more questions and listened intently to the answers.  The result?   A $600k+ improvement in product sales.
9/ Ask  You don't get what you don't ask for.   That doesn't mean ask willy-nilly. It means being smart with my asks.  This year, I've talked to people I never would have imagined.  Interviewed amazing guests.  Was featured on sites I felt were out of my reach.  Ask!
8/ Give  Over the last few years, I didn't give much back in terms of time or money.   I was overwhelmed.  Candidly, it made me feel a lack of purpose.  This year, I've spent a lot of time giving away my time, donating to causes I support, &amp; spreading love anonymously.
7/ Collaborate  2022 has been all about collaboration for me.  I've met about 10-15 people here on Twitter that I regularly speak to for advice.  Just jamming out, building in public, releasing products, and supporting one another.  More focus on relationships in 2023.
6/ Ignore  With over 460k social media followers across 2 channels, you get a lot of nasty comments.  People are mean. Angry. Condescending. Cruel. Shitty.  I got really aggressive with the block button this year.  My content, my mental health, my rules.
5/ Rest  In 2019, I burned out at my executive job.  In early-2022, I was running the risk of doing the same as a creator.  My solution?  - 6-mile daily walks - 30-minute built-in breaks - One day per week off  In 2023, I'll move to a 3-day workweek.
4/ Focus  I've spent time as a SaaS advisor, coach, mentor, investor, and digital product creator.  2021 was the first year I really spent the majority of my time focused on products.  2020 products: 19% of income 2021 products: 52% of revenue 2022 products: 73% of revenue
3/ Repurpose  My business runs on content.  And after writing unique pieces every day for over 3 years, I finally started to repurpose  It made me nervous.  The outcome?  Nobody noticed and the pieces were widely read by people who had never seen them the first time around.
2/ Reduce  My 5 revenue streams run on so many pieces of technology.  Bills add up, things break, and opportunities are missed.  I cut a bunch of technology and folded all of my businesses into a new site.  All-in-one tech makes things so much more manageable.
1/ Plan  When you're running 100 mph, things get chaotic.  Over the last year, I started breaking my revenue goals down to the day.  Bite-sized goals are more approachable &amp; help increase your likelihood of success.  I highly suggest backing into yours by month, week, and day.

@morganjingram Help. The. Customer.
@HumbleFlow @DBarnettMoncton @DeanOwenTaxes @WrongsToWrite @PerfectGuide_ @UpSkillYourLife @Ant_Philosophy @liftyourmind Thank you 🙏🏻
@bewritethere Funny enough, I didn't use a publishing tool on this.
@heyBarsee That's a huge part of it.
@waleagboola_ Of course.
@itsmatt_g Exactly. Focus on $1 and you'll make $1,000.
@itsadityabansal That's 100% true.
@heyOnuoha Lots of people are consistent and fail. It's about having a decent strategy.
The reason that making $1 matters is that it changes your mindset.  Here's the entire blueprint to follow.  Start this evening or start tomorrow. Just start.   https://t.co/2MgaN9ft9X
4. Use easy tech  Tech doesn't matter in the beginning.   Use what's cheap and easy, or what you already know how to use.  Stop looking for the "perfect stack". It doesn't exist.
3. Build an email list  Start a newsletter or build a free guide.  Offer it up and ask people to subscribe.  Deplatform your most interested users to a list that you control.
2. Grow a small audience  Once you've talked to people, next up is sharing info they care about.  Tweet daily about what you learn.  Show them you care about solving the problems you learned about.
1. Talk to people  You can't make a dollar without understanding people's problems.  Too many people skip this step.  Go talk to your prospective customers.
How to make $1 on the internet:
@matt_gray_ Poolsuite is awesome :)
@SahilBloom I'm adding to mine each month...
@TMitrosilis I like that approach, Teddy.
@Nicolascole77 If you're doing the 2nd list daily, do you think the first list can be indicators that things are moving in the right direction?
@austinbelcak The education system needs a complete overhaul.  The results speak for themselves. And they're not good.
@thedankoe The most successful people find that one authentic thing and amplify it.  The rest just mimic other people. That's why 90% of stuff looks and sounds the same.
@AlexAndBooks_ Moist productivity tools are simply packaged up distraction.
@heyeaslo Congrats man!
@KateBour Sell me a transformation.
@ppcClickShark I find that people often end up doing a lot of things they don't enjoy under the guise of "high priority".   Most people aren't very good at knowing what to prioritize in the first place.
@aka_akadonblack I think this is viewed through the lens of "productivity".  I just don't like the idea that we're supposed to maximize productivity rather than spend a few hours doing things we truly enjoy.
@traincoachlaugh Ha. I'll take that, Scott.
@FrankElda1 Get to a point where you don't need productivity apps.
@andrewmcbarnett I agree, Andrew.
@dan72ros I love Judaism. Great up in a Jewish neighborhood and always found it fascinating.
@lewis_hatchett Sounds great. It's tougher to do those things when you aren't present.  The best way to be present? Eliminate a lot of things you shouldn't be doing.
@highlandbreath Very smart. Lots of interesting ways people do this.
@natolisnuggets Exactly, man.
@TnvMadhav Not familiar. I'll take a look at it. Thanks!
@tspeeg Exactly.  Too many shiny things.
@theantonioreza For sure. Once you realize it, then it's time to take action.
@thethinkingbat That's true.  It's takes being cognizant.
@UncleBimBim Same here, man.
@aadifernandes It's a good exercise.
@writing_cheats @george__mack For sure.   But don't forget to stop doing things you hate.
@gabe_llewellyn 100%. The more you say no, the bigger your Yes power gets.
@Web3Mitchy They can for sure.
@johncdrilling Thanks, John!
@YannBrds It sure is, Yann.
Too many people have to-do lists.  Not enough people have don't-do lists.
@rawbinz It's shocking how many people have asked me instead of just Googling:  "What is ICP in the context of business?"   https://t.co/W8agPtt4Ab
@gillianography I think you'd be crazy not to.  But, I'm very biased.
1. Understanding your talent  2. Knowing the value of your knowledge  3. Putting your peer's knowledge into perspective  4. Learning to ponder your accomplishments  5. The Snowball Effect  Read it here:  https://t.co/WaCrXgyN13
My newsletter on Impostor Syndrome has generated more positive responses than any other issue.  48,127 received it 3 hours ago.  Here's what I covered:  ↓  https://t.co/FTUnejkNqx
@VKhoroshkov There are definitely times when you should quit.
@andrewglynch You might be right. The worst case is maximum and not viable.
@blakeaburge Haha. True story.
@SahilBloom Ain't this the truth, man.
@fridayvictorjnr Ideal customer profile
@iammosesaboh For sure you can.
@singraft14 ICP = ideal customer profile MVP = minimum viable product
@nathanarodgers Keep going man!
@Shareef_ZA Me too. I've been both!
@theantonioreza Always.
How successful solopreneurs operate:  - Has an idea - Talks to their ICP - Builds MVP solution - Drives traffic through content - Validates  Why most solopreneurs fail:  - Has an idea - Researches - Researches - Researches - Gets frustrated by tech - Researches more - Quits
@blakeaburge Love how you show off the actual process in the GIFs. Very cool, Blake. Need to do that with some of the stuff I'm teaching for sure.
@thatroblennon This is awesome, Rob. I’m glad my content resonated and was helpful!
@natolisnuggets You put in the work and it worked.  That's the missing ingredient for a lot of folks.   Keep going, my man.
@RoryTanner @mattragland @AliAbdaal Thanks for the awesome shout out! I had beers with Matt a few days ago.
@ChristineCarril @stevenshills20 Thank you!
@austinbelcak That's right.  Take a number of small risks rather than be catastrophically foolish.
@OneJKMolina How do you click on things without a proper stretch?
@mrdhavals It may be contrarian but I'm 100% in agreement with you.
@Nicolascole77 It's weird how the more you put out there, the better chance you have at making a hit.
@thedankoe And you can't be afraid to repel people that are in complete non-alignment.  Playing in the middle gets you nowhere.
@agazdecki Objective = Have fun Key Results = Laughter on Zoom
@sweatystartup Just preparing them for the normal office job.
@KateBour This is awesome. I love it, Katelyn.
@wealthluxx Probably not, no.
@weisesabio Thanks, Mark!
@gregisenberg Nearly everyone successful does.  Overcoming it allows you to harness it's power.
@SahilBloom It's the same view I have.  Mediocre performers almost never have impostor syndrome. In fact, they tend to believe they are better than the facts show.  It's high performers that can be crippled if they don't understand what you just said.
@IAmZachHackett It's true.
@Jousefm2 @SahilBloom I agree. But it's tough to reach that conclusion.
@IAmZachHackett @SahilBloom It certainly can be. But nearly everyone who has impostor syndrome has it because they are achieving something they don't believe possible.  That's better than being an underperformer!
@UncleBimBim It's never fully gone, but can certainly be controlled. Glad to hear you're kicking it's butt.
@aadifernandes Looking fwd to sharing it, Aadi.
@mat_pln Always, Mat.
Tomorrow, I'm going to talk about my journey with Impostor Syndrome.  It's going out in my weekly newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.  So, if you've ever struggled with it, or feel like an impostor, come give it a read.  Join 48,127 subscribers here:  https://t.co/X3l2wg6fme
4. You stop thinking that everyone knows more than you do  As you progress in your journey towards overcoming this, you'll meet people you hold in high regard.  And guess what?  They don't know everything either.  We're all just figuring it out.
3. You no longer feel blind to the value of your knowledge  You start having honest conversations with your peers.  And by doing so, you realize that your knowledge is powerful and valuable.  Not value-less.   You'll understand that what you know, everyone else doesn't.
2. You stop rearranging facts in your mind  By analyzing your past you realize there has been some mental rearrangement of facts.  Getting those facts on paper helps you realize you're lying to yourself.  Taming those lies helps the healing process.
1. You no longer think you're less talented  By looking objectively at your accomplishments, you eliminate the fallacy of "this is all luck".  You start to realize you're likely more talented than you think.  Not less.
4 things that happen when you beat Impostor Syndrome:
@abhishekshah173 @jayclouse @OhioState Of course. I love the B10.
@dvassallo This is a phenomenal article. You can tell the person writing it actually enjoys it.   Thanks for the share.
@adammarx13 @jayclouse @OhioState I love it too.  https://t.co/4R22iHy1VU
@jayclouse @OhioState I’d love to talk to the students. Haven’t been back to Columbus in a long time and want to get reconnected and give back.   If you’re comfortable, feel free to intro me. Many thanks 🙏
@jayclouse @OhioState How have I never done this?  Don’t they want to talk to a graduate who started off his collegiate career with a 1.9 GPA?
@thegenuinejulie @bewritethere We're all saying the same things thousands of different ways :)
@thegenuinejulie I wrote this article in February of 2022 before you ever joined Twitter.  How's that?
@SahilBloom I appreciate that, man.   It’s just something I enjoy, tbh.
Monetization is the outcome of these 3 parts.  I break down the "Creator Funnel" in much greater detail here:   https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE
3. Deepening relationships  True relationships are about access.   A "behind-the-scenes" glimpse at how someone thinks, acts, works, etc.  It's much easier to build relationships once they fully trust your expertise and knowledge.  This is why Community is so important.
1. Getting Discovered  Learning to stand out online is part of modern marketing.  The easiest way to get discovered is to create value where people are already consuming.  - Twitter - LinkedIn - TikTok - YouTube  Etc.
Every creator needs a "Creator Funnel".  A simple journey your audience goes through, increasing the chance they become a customer at each step.  It has 3 parts:  ↓
@dickiebush This is one of the best processes for building a very high-affinity audience.
@Nicolascole77 It's hard to call yourself a writer if you never hit publish.
@thedankoe I think one reason is that we're consistently bombarded with the idea that having money is bad. Evil. For the worst people.  It isn't.  Money is an amplifier of who you are as a person.  That's why more good people should get some.
@aaditsh Congrats on the monster launch, man!  Just dropped you an upvote.
@agazdecki Nail those 2 things and hire a bunch of smart people to take care of the rest...
@TMitrosilis Consistency is a combination of ever-improving discipline and systems for when that discipline ultimately fails (and it will)
@AndrewPierno Best case is never going back to corporate.
@TheGeomarAbreu It's a lot of fun and puts you in a much better position to succeed in the future.
@barrettjoneill That's how I feel too, Barrett.
@aaronmmota I think so too. Just take 30 days, some free software, and an idea. See if you can push the ball forward a bit.  Then, just keep going.
@FitFounder It really is.   I miss the employees, but not the control over how I spend my time.
@sweatystartup @dickiebush Do you like this?  Considering one for my new place.
@darentsmith Start, then learn.
@matt_gray_ Ain't that the truth, Matt.   Play in the arena and win the prizes.
@coacharausch Hell yeah, Andrew.
@UnderstoryCopy Absolutely.  The cringe-worthy moments are how you know you're learning.
@michailkarpov 1. Build an audience around a specific topic 2. Build trust using longer-form content 3. Build systems to stay consistent
@TheDannyNaz Haha. Exactly.
@mkhundmiri I love that, Mustafa. Do it because you want to, not have to. Completely different outlook.
@Albadawee I love that, Sohaib!
@pajamahustle They really are.
@Anshul_Nanda1 100% , Anshul.
@YounglingAndCo Yep. Own the process.
@GideonGreat_M Thanks, man.
@SahilBloom Truth.
I've worked as an executive at companies that have raised $300M+ and generated $400M+ in revenue.  But I've never learned more than I'm learning now, screwing around building my own thing on the internet.  Start a side project.  You won't be sorry.
@matt_gray_ Very cool man. Didn't know this...

@slowat @Rameshoflondon Or just release that each month has 4.333 weeks 😀
@OneJKMolina This is the exact playbook I ran to scale my last business. I love it.   Literally, anyone can do this.
@arvidkahl I'll sleep when I'm dead, bro! 🥴
@thedankoe Invest in building a network and then watch them invest in you. Killer strategy.
@wes_kao You see this a lot when building sales orgs like I did in my previous life.  You give someone a tactic to do something better in the sales call.  They try it once and it "doesn't work".  It's not meant to work 100% of the time. It's mean to impro
@agazdecki You're the GOAT at this, man.
@Liviglarge Daniel Vassallo comes to mind right away.  No fancy website, mostly just uses Content + Gumroad.
@foundersuccess For sure.
@AlanJLSmith Haha. Nailed it, Alan.
@BradleyYoungjr Same. I've gotten to landing pages before and I'm like, "How do I buy this?"
@SullyOmarr Try a few things and see what sticks. But you have to have some direction based on a strong opinion you have about something.
@Albadawee Sure does, Sohaib.
@FitFounder Complicate down the road if need be!
@hey_dhruv 100, Dhruv.
@SimonHoiberg That sounds perfect :)
@gregisenberg That can all come later, if necessary.
I know people doing $10k/month with nothing more than:  - Content attention - A very strong landing page - A well-priced product or service - A simple way to accept payments  That’s literally it.  As always, resist the urge to overcomplicate.  Start simple.
@matt_gray_ Nice stuff here, Matt. Been using BlackMagic the same way for 3+ months now.  Gamechanger.
@gregisenberg Thank you, sir.
@robinsmorenburg  https://t.co/MacNbGJgcv
@thedankoe It will also help you stick to your purpose and find the 20% of action that moves the needle.
@gregisenberg Share openly and freely.   When it comes time to earn money, people will pay for aggregation, speed, and accountability.
@blakeaburge Once you've written them down, how do you think about tackling them?
@KateBour And the definition of a scam artist is taking the simple and making it complex.
@shwnhll 3.5 years of posting each morning at the exact same time and actually interacting with my audience :)
@avi_schneier Sure, you'll love a lot of the process. But the boring stuff will be there. And if it's part of the 20% that moves the needle, it's best that it gets done...
@TMitrosilis Right? This hack is crazy!
@sultanofcopy Not quite yet. On my way though!
@mgppap Success isn't a destination. It's many moments over your life.
@Nailingthreads Most people don't want to do the boring stuff or they are focused on the wrong boring stuff.
@tspeeg That's the key ingredient.
@robertoblake Super facts. It's finding the 20% that's the difficult part.
@pelaseyed Zero, Ismail.
@KalenHouck True story. I see this with my own eyes every day.
@simohosio Yep. Focus matters.
@theantonioreza The most monotonous thing but the right monotonous thing.
@gideon_shawana You're welcome. Thanks for stopping by to read.
@TnvMadhav Yep. That's basically it here.
@hey_dhruv And focused.
Success is just boring consistency applied to the 20% of stuff that actually matters.
@TheeChrisPeters Calendly has a free plan that works and you can use Google Meets or any other free video solution. Doesn't have to be a paid Zoom license.

@thisiskp_ Get after it!
@_waseembaloch_ Smart move.
@MalkanKaya @SahilBloom Exactly. Bookmarking it doesn't make it happen.

@barrettjoneill Thank you, Barrett!
@CSMikeCardona That's awesome, man!
@SachinRamje Ain't it though?
@thedankoe Thank you, man.  Trying new stuff to see what sticks.
@HireFireTeam Not quite that literally, no.   But when people reach out, take it to DM, do some discovery and then let them know you think you could help them solve the problem.   Then share how they can sign up for a session.
@AuthorOnTheSide I love Gumroad.  I like being able to customize my site through Carrd. Just more flexibility in my mind.
@SeanPHogue Yep. Most people never validate or get it wrong.
@FitFounder Thank you, brother. Appreciate it.
@ecomchasedimond Here it is :)
@wes_kao Exactly. Lots of nuances. But get started.
@didioke_ @joserosado Thank you.
@_robwilloughby Thanks, Rob.
@writes_eve @SahilBloom Keep going, Eve!
@hustlenconquer Go for it. I stole it.
@blakeaburge The bare minimum. I scaled this to $40k per month.
@leoarun @SahilBloom I don't know of a list, but you can create a side hustle with any knowledge or skill
@joserosado Thanks, Jose. Glad it sparked a little thought.
@_heydave Thanks, Dave!
@natolisnuggets Hell yes! :)
@babushka99 Thanks!
@cantbemikerich @BryantFerate It takes more than 30 days. That's the kicker.
@_heydave Thanks, Dave. Most of this stuff needs to be explained more simplistically.
@abhishekshah173 I love it. Keep it going!
@TMitrosilis Appreciate you, brother.
@Nicolascole77 Haha. Thanks man. I worked on it and felt good about it.
@babushka99 Thank you!
@KurtisHanni For sure, Kurtis.
@PRINCELY_ARTs Let us know.
@HeyAmna1 Thanks, Anna!
@SahilBloom I'd LOVE that! Someone should just take this, run with it, and report back.
If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Listen, this is certainly not perfect.  There are a million nuances I didn't mention.  But know that getting started is the hardest part.  So, try the above cheatsheet for 6 months. Tinker around with it, listen to your customers, experiment, &amp; make changes.  I hope this helps.
If you can book:  2 calls per week at $150 an hour: $1,300 per month 3 calls per week at $150 an hour: $1,950 per month 3 calls per week at $250 an hour: $3,250 per month  The possibilities are endless.
14. After payment, redirect checkout to the Calendly account.  15. Then, add your website to your Twitter profile.  16. Continue creating great content each day.  17. When people ask questions, direct them to the link to pay.
11. Open up a few slots outside of your 9 to 5.  12. Add a "Buy" button to your Carrd page.   13. Redirect it to Stripe checkout.
https://t.co/5cR1y1mToD up a free Stripe account and create a paid service  9. Title the service "From X to Y in 60 minutes" Example: "From clueless to writing your first line of code in 60 min."  10. Open up a free Calendly and create the same exact event.
5. Do 15-20 calls to better understand how to solve their problem.  6. Create a process you can walk people through in 60 minutes.  7. Then go to Carrd and build a simple personal website for $19.
2. Create daily content that talks about one challenge you solve.  3. When people ask questions on your Tweets, DM them.  4. Ask them if they'd like to talk for free, to see if you can help.
How to build a $1,300/month side business for $19.  Here's the entire 17-step business plan for you:  1. Clean up your Twitter profile to reflect what you do for people.
@abhishekshah173 Thanks for including me with these superstars, Abhishek.  Much appreciated, my man.
@abhishekshah173 Appreciate you!
@sweatystartup I'm 25% of the way through it and it's really hit me hard.  Very purpose driven.   Props to @TMitrosilis for the gift.
@abhishekshah173 Thanks for the inclusion with these great folks, Abhishek!
@dickiebush 4. If I don't like it, can I easily walk away without a hit to my reputation and financial situation?
@austinbelcak This is fantastic, man. Thanks for sharing!
@thedankoe Finishing strategic projects is one of the most euphoric feelings out there.
@agazdecki Congratulations, Andrew!
@sweatystartup That's basically a good life right there.   Have you read "The Second Mountain" by David Brooks?
@TMitrosilis A fixed mindset is focused on what others are doing.  A growth mindset is focused on what you're doing.
@CuriousDan3 I think you're more in agreement with me than you might be aware of.
@austinbelcak Put in the work, reap the luck and the rewards.
@CuriousDan3 No, I wouldn't say so.   Do you think that's a good example or an outlier?
@PaulElijas I generally agree with that. Looking fwd to watching this.
@sairahul1 It definitely can. You need to be in a position to get lucky though. And that often (not always) requires hard work.
@staneika Of course, those can happen.   But, picking outliers generally isn't the best way to determine whether or not something is more or less likely to happen.
@pveugen They are absolutely intertwined. I don't disagree with that.
@Albadawee Nailing it, Sohaib,
@andrewglynch I love that quote, Andrew. Thanks for sharing it, man.
@BackpackerFI Wow, I love that, Danny!
@_robwilloughby True story, Rob.
@theantonioreza ALmost always, Antonio!
@tspeeg My dad's favorite line.
@hey_dhruv I like that, Dhruv!
@jarrylew That's 100% true, IMO, as well, Jarek.
@jappleby One of my faves too.  Hope the NY apartment search gets better, man!
What most people call "luck" is usually just unnoticed hard work.
@HargroveAlex Cheers! 🍻
@HargroveAlex I didn't say everyone should sell every piece of advice.  I just think people should be cognizant of the fact that their knowledge has value.
@Albadawee Yes sir.
@itsmarcosruiz That's gotta happen first.
@jarrylew Knowledge blindness.
@FahimAnvar Good or bad?
@JoeyGMendoza That's exactly it, Joey.
Every time you email a friend with a helpful tip for their business, you are sharing knowledge someone else on Twitter would pay for.
@SergioRocks Congrats, brother! :)
@FitFounder That's the ticket right there, my man.
@dickiebush Success is just boring consistency applied to the same important things.
@thedankoe Or they pull you down because deep in their hearts they think it should have been them.  They are projecting the anger they feel at themselves onto you. Classic.
@bryhutch That's awesome to hear, Bryan!
@SeanPHogue I love that, Sean. Definitely part of the reason I'm here.
@Jasielinvests Keep going!
@mjovanovictech It will, Milan!
@dennis_geelen This is the best comment right here. Nailed it, Dennis.
@LilianPertenava Stress is not a bad thing.  Burnout is, but stress is required to move forward in life.
@natolisnuggets Literally, never.
@dev_hoss Thanks, Hossam.
@NunoG_Rodrigues Don't chase money.  Chase solving problems. Money will come.
Jobs that destroy your mental health are never worth it.  Even with huge pay, it never works.  Instead:  1. Find a great job 2. Focus on your health 3. Spend time working on "obsession" projects 4. Turn them into a full-time business over time  Hard to do when burning out.
@mattragland Text me.   I got you.
@CSMikeCardona @maximehugodupre This is SO cool.  Gonna start using this to test mine. Thanks for sharing, Mike.
@matt_gray_ The "never sleeps part" is so true. That's why it's important to leverage a team to constantly be churning out valuable content for your users.   Good stuff, Matt.
@SahilBloom Too many zero-sum mindsets.
@SahilBloom Great thread.  A lifesaver for me has been "no templates".  I have a template that my VA uses to politely decline a number of different asks that are on my avoid-at-all-costs list.
@ThePupOfWallSt For sure. Get that time back.
@Richard_andey Nailed it, Andrew.
@ItsKieranDrew Love these additions, Kieran. Thanks for taking the time to add them!
@OneSahilB I should have included that. Great lesson, Sahil.
@Promise_cee Smart move, Promise.
@aasthaxgautam Thanks for reading!
@Albadawee For sure, Sohaib. Focus on that 20%.
Advice I wish I had 2 years ago:  • Focus on the 20% that matters • Generating online attention is critical • Outsource/automate administrative tasks • Operate a portfolio of small bets, not huge risks • Block and ignore anyone who doesn't deserve you  Hope that helps.
@jessicajychan @AliAbdaal @thedankoe @simonsinek @JamesClear @dickiebush Thanks, Jessica!
@Twinkleinvest Thank you for the feature!
@mattragland  https://t.co/IgruFxZYCa
@Richard_andey Definitely.  Build that system, but also infuse it with a personal touch.
@contentmaniac_ Thanks, Munawwarah!
@blakeaburge Caring about people is a winning strategy.
@ChrisPotter361 Oh, 100%. I love this, Chris.
@toluwaniadewole Great question!
@FitFounder Thanks, brother. Right back at ya, man.
@Nailingthreads For sure. But I like good old fashioned customer service.
If you run a one-person business, your goal should be to surprise and delight your customer.  - Prompt response time - Cheerful email etiquette - 10x value products &amp; services - No questions asked refund policy  It's not hard.  Treat your customers the way you want to be treated.
@blakeaburge These are epic. I love sh*t like this, Blake. Thank you!
@matt_gray_ Wait until you're 41 😂   The next 9 years are wild.
@francis_oleh Also one I don't like! :)
@Walter_Haydock Or, "Is anything easier done than said?"
@bewritethere @thedankoe @KateBour @EdLatimore @aaditsh @wes_kao Ideation is the hard part!
@GabeMarusca @thedankoe @KateBour @EdLatimore @aaditsh @wes_kao Thanks, Gabe!
@GideonGreat_M @thedankoe @KateBour @EdLatimore @aaditsh @wes_kao Gonna be a whole separate issue on mine.
@ItsKieranDrew @thedankoe @KateBour @EdLatimore @aaditsh @wes_kao That's going to be a whole separate issue.
I asked 5 entrepreneurs their biggest mistake:  - @thedankoe of Modern Mastery - @KateBour of Customer Camp - @EdLatimore of Mind &amp; Fist - @aaditsh of Maker's Mark - @wes_kao of Maven  Read all 5 in my newsletter tomorrow.  Join 46,177 subscribers here:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
@asmartbear @mkhundmiri I make french fries every day.  So, jokes on you!
@mkhundmiri You're too kind, man.  I appreciate the spotlight here. Cheers to you, Mustafa 🙌
The 8-step journey of a prospective Twitter follower.  1) Reads your content 2) Clicks your profile 3) Sees your banner 4) Looks at your headshot 5) Reads your tagline 7) Checks your pinned Tweet 8) Follows you or doesn't  Convert more people by maximizing each touchpoint.
@SahilBloom  https://t.co/DaXPMrLjM1
@SahilBloom Looking forward to it. Always a great read!
@chapterscrtv Cal Ripken.
@jjpbouman Recency bias + the right length to keep my newsletter short.
@The_Skill_Lab Just keep experimenting.
@thecookiedosai That's exactly it, Abha.
@bewritethere True, Pranshu.
@justincsimon Sometimes you just gotta outlast people.
@hey_dhruv Exactly how to tell, Dhruv.
@heyjoeyjustice  https://t.co/1N6y7njato
Solopreneurs don't need viral content.  Marketing yourself is about getting on base every day.  - Familiar name - Familiar face - Familiar topic - Familiar content  It's cliché as hell but play Moneyball.
@ramit They continuously refer to money as "evil" and tear down anyone attempting to make more of it.
@AlexLlullTW It's a great strategy, man.
@thisiskp_ Motivation and inspiration are huge.
@blakeaburge Same here. That's my fave.
@SahilBloom True story.
@dklineii I mix and match
@matt_gray_ Love @GrowthDotDesign
I break down these 4 examples in a recent newsletter issue:  - Why it matters - How to effectively do it - Who on Twitter does it really well  And more.  Read it here:  https://t.co/laDk9hPtqM
4. This person understands me  Last is content that is high on empathy.  Content that reaches your audience &amp; says, "I understand what you're going through" or, "you're not alone in that experience".  This content greatly humanizes an otherwise inanimate social media profile.
3. This person makes me think  We all come across content that challenges our preconceived notions.  This can be really powerful.  It should leave your audience with the reaction, "I've never thought of it like that before" or "Woah, what great way to describe that".
2. This person entertains me  If you hammer your audience with facts and teachings 100% of the time, you run the risk of boring them.  Then you get tuned out.   Get people smiling, laughing, and sharing with their friends.  They are likely to see you as someone worth reading.
1. This person wants to help me  If you teach prospective followers and customers how to do something, you'll be seen as a helpful mentor online.  Content like this also shows the reader that you're truly a master of your domain, rather than someone providing high-level fluff.
Everyone should have a strategy to produce "emotional response" content.  The problem?   Most people forget they're writing for the reader.  Here are 4 emotional responses for excellent content:  ↓
@schlaf I've have "On Confidence" by @TheSchoolOfLife and it's excellent. I'll have to pick this up.
@dvassallo Assume most of what you build will fail, and be surprised when it doesn't.  Then be nimble, and work to expand it.  Then? Try to replicate under the same belief as before.
@austinbelcak I'm optimizing for life-life balance ;-)
@thedankoe Also - do what you say you're going to do.  Literally, nobody does.
@aaditsh I really enjoyed Build Once, Sell Twice by @jackbutcher
@wes_kao This is why selling is everything :)
@agazdecki Some of the best moments of my life were building Zocdoc and PatientPop. I tell stories about 2009 and 2015 all of the time.   Some of my best friends are from those places.  Have fun. Enjoy the ride.
@sweatystartup This is why, when I have a product idea, I don't ask people if they want it or like it.  I ask them to pay for the idea.   Then, I build it if I get enough interest.   Saves me a lot of time.
@KateBour Many customers think they know what they want, but often it's not what they need.  Wrap what they need in a story that makes it feel like what they want.   Then deliver it.
@TMitrosilis Success is not a destination. It's many moments in time over the course of your life.
@matt_gray_ Solid list here, Matt. Hearing great things about Alex.
@AuthorOnTheSide Hell yeah, man!
@BenjaminPutano Wow...this is one of the most robust threads on writing I've come across.  Appreciate the feature as well, Ben!
Online Course Marketing 101:  Your offer should answer, "What, exactly, will customers achieve?"  It's not: "Learn copywriting"  It's: "In 1 hour, you'll learn the process for creating 10 high-quality pieces of written content each day"  Outcome clarity is critical.
@blakeaburge Next up? Notion
@SahilBloom Right?
@CoppensTom Had to make sure that was in there or it didn't make sense :)
@dickiebush This is excellent, excellent writing advice. Ever since you told me to separate my writing and editing, it's become so much better.
@JustinWise Oh, goodness. So many.
@Nicolascole77 Like most things, great writing is the outcome of a process.
@thedankoe So many people doing Copy/Paste on someone else's business only to find out they don't know how to deliver the results.
@rrmdp @levelsio I know people who have been waiting 3+ years to ship something they've been building when they could have put it into the hands of new users to trial and provide feedback.
@RachelThalmann You're onto something here, Rachel!
@gibson_benstowe I like that :)
@coacharausch I'm loving your comments, Andrew. Keep 'em up!
@hey_earcus I love that.
@TessaRDavis It's on us to create v1 and works towards "perfection" (not attainable) over time...
@DavidCrysler Exactly, David.
@bewritethere Exactly. A lot of folks just waiting...
@robhoffman20 At least get started, Rob!
@JODonnellCoach Take small, meaningful action with the long game in mind.
@TnvMadhav I love it :)
Good things don't always come to those who wait.  Good things come to those who take smart action in the short term and remain consistent in the long term.  Waiting and waiting until everything is "perfect" will yield the opposite of good things.  It will likely yield nothing.
@drarunjayaraj I definitely was 70/30 discipline in the beginning.   Has shifted over time for sure.
Solopreneurship is part discipline and part random.  The discipline makes up ~40% of my schedule.  - Healthy goals - Daily action steps - Regular check-in points  The other 60% remains flexible for interesting new opportunities.  Trust me, it's a lot less fun if it's 100% rigid.
@alexgarcia_atx Roast me.    https://t.co/sTZwmJ4ydp
@Nicolascole77 This is my entire strategy in one Tweet.
@thedankoe Whatever you do, do it excellently. That's how you move levels.
@blakeaburge And think about the act as a "small risk" vs. being catastrophically foolish. Move fast, move small and examine.
@OneJKMolina @MrFourToEight I guess that's how I felt when I hit Decillion per month.
@KateBour This is a great teaser. Bravo 😃
@joserosado Well, I must say the copy is extraordinary.   I'll be grabbing it today.   You crushed it.
@MrFourToEight I understand that.  I think you might be swapping "compared myself to" with "I was inspired by".   I think there's a slight difference there. Just my opinion though.
@_theakinwale I love that, Akin.
@joserosado Exactly, Jose.  P.S. Your landing page for your new Instagram course is fire. I read through it and it just knocked my socks off.  I'll be borrowing for upcoming products! 😂
@Johnson_AsiNG Yep. I agree with that, man.
@jarrylew Same, jarek.
@JustinWise That's my goal :)
@agazdecki It's also a long game with many winners.  It's easy to forget that someone else's success doesn't preclude you from being successful.
@marcuscelestin_ I don't.  I fall victim to it all of the time.  This message is written to myself.
@Student4everOne I love that, Jagadeesh.
@KarlKaufmanADI I've always loved that quote, Karl.
@ItsKieranDrew It's a huge trap. But I just remind myself that I'm much further ahead than where I was 2 years ago.   That's what matters.
@Kebiru_Momodu_ That's an awesome way of putting it, Kay.
@HeyAmna1 You can follow their strategy, but it's tough to shortcut the journey.
@JODonnellCoach You can't. You'll set yourself up for failure.
Solopreneurship 101:  Comparing yourself to others is the easiest way to get distracted.  You can only control how successful you are, not how successful someone else is.  Be the best version of yourself, not a better version of someone else.
@thedankoe The "take your project public" part of this resonates.   If you're doing a lot of interesting things in life but not sharing them, that's fine.   But you're missing big opportunities to inspire, connect, partner, earn, etc.

4. Leverage the LinkedIn Comment "pin"  You can now pin a comment on any LinkedIn post, which I use to drive newsletter subs and website visits.  Drive 800 visitors just yesterday.  https://t.co/g9GIZGUIp8
3. Put it in my LinkedIn Profile 2x  LinkedIn now has both a featured section and a profile URL (like Twitter).   This drives thousands of new subs per month.  You're missing out if you don't have this setup.  https://t.co/XRqYj7BizU
2. Used Hypefury autoplugs  I generated 604 additional clicks to my newsletter landing page without lifting a finger.  Simple Auto-plugging anytime I had a popular Tweet.  https://t.co/6Z5M7FzWAu
1. Used the Revue badge on my Twitter profile  I don't use Revue for my newsletter, but that's ok!  I set up a Zap for Revue → Kajabi so I could add the badge to my profile.  Easy capture via Twitter.  https://t.co/pBssWh8w3a

That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
If you can nail these 4 things, you are absolutely on your way to 1,000 true fans.   TL;DR  1. Think like a niche "streaming service"  2. Become a Category Pirate  3. Tell a story worth following  4. Do unscalable things
I cannot overstate how important it is to be everywhere when you're just getting started.   A lot of people refer to this as simply "creating value", but there needs to be a deeper definition of how to do that.  I think @dvassallo captured it best when he stated it like this:  https://t.co/TmWZwZN5uG
1. Published daily to social media, often 2x per day. 2. Replied to every comment, every morning for an hour. 3. Responded to 75%+ of the DMs I received on social media. 4. Engaged w/ 10+ people's content every morning for over a year.  Not scalable but massively valuable!
4/ Do Unscalable Things  With a tight niche, unique perspective, &amp; compelling story, you'll make significant progress.  But you can't just put this all on "autopilot".  In the beginning, you're going to need to do a lot of things that don't scale.  Here are some things I did:
The story can't be made up or fake.   It should be your real story but stitched together in a fashion that makes it easy (and exciting) to follow along.  There's a formula for doing that.  Feel free to steal my 7-step process to create yours:
3/ Tell a Story Worth Following:  I call this building a better backstory.  Much like the founder of a startup company, you need a story that compels your audience to follow you.   They need to literally see themselves in you.
P.S. I wrote more about non-obvious content here:   https://t.co/M9Q9qqFMhW  Let's keep going ↓
So, have a unique viewpoint in your niche.  - What is something everyone believes to be true, that you don't? - What is something nobody in your niche is talking about, that they should be? - What are the biggest mistakes people are making, that they are oblivious to?
“Becoming a Category Pirate is 100x easier when you become known for your unique perspective inside of your niche.  You don’t need everyone in the world to care about who you are &amp; what you do.  You just need a small pirate ship of folks who agree with your unique perspective."
And the easiest way to stand out is through non-obvious content.  Non-obvious content is all about bringing a brand new thought process to your niche.  Something that makes you radically different than others.  I talked to @Nicolascole77 , to get his take:
2/ Become a Category Pirate:  If you nail a niche, you're likely to have a small group of people who come along with you on your journey.  But, at some point, you must bring a unique perspective to the table if you want to keep growing.  You can't just share the obvious.
You can't just "help small businesses".   You're much better off helping "SaaS companies in the finance vertical, below $10M in revenue".  The more helpful your content is to a specific audience, the more likely they are to find your "signal" in a world of generic "noise".
1/ Think Like a Niche Streaming Service:  In 2021, big streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu saw their market share drop from 65% to 48%.  Meanwhile, niche streaming services are growing at more than 2x the rate of the major players.  Why?  Because niche content resonates.
Building an audience of raving fans is the key to unlocking internet revenue.  But when you start from zero, it's incredibly hard.  Nail these 4 points below, you'll be well on your way.  1. Think niche 2. Become a pirate 3. Tell a story 4. Go unscalable  Let's dive in.
How to find your first 1,000 true fans on the internet.  A 4-step tactical plan:  🧵

@SahilBloom This is basically an MBA in one thread.
@austinbelcak Said no to nearly everything.
@thedankoe Combine a natural curiosity with a system for consistency and you have a pretty winning combo.
@agazdecki That's a great way to summarize a lot of 800-word blog posts on this subject.
@KateBour The only thing that is "quicker" is generally learning common mistakes from others before you make them.   But even then, there's something helpful in making (and learning from) them on your own.
@coreyhearne Sure feels like it Corey.
@SahilBloom Sure thing. The one from Harry and AOC is pretty interesting.

That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Your action:  7. How often are you sharing your opinions and work freely online?  8. When interesting opportunities come your way, are you seizing them?  9. Are you staying consistent and creating compound momentum?
Your purpose:  1. Do you truly appreciate time as currency?  2. What is your motivation for time freedom?  3. How have you curated an environment that supports your goal?
In Summary  The journey towards designing a life of intention never ends.  Here are the three groups and nine key drivers to always be improving, in the form of simple questions you can ask yourself ↓  https://t.co/tJbRoaGMOo
The Undisciplined Creator  This is someone with motivation &amp; action but no discipline.  They share freely &amp; shine a spotlight on their work. But the success isn’t immediate.  Then they crumble. The world isn’t fair. Why should I change? I want to keep doing things my way.  https://t.co/CWYiB6xu6a
The Aimless Producer  This is someone with discipline that takes action, but they lack purpose.  They are heads down on work &amp; in competition with others. Moving full speed ahead.  They never stop to consider purpose, making it an unfulfilling hamster wheel with no end in sight.  https://t.co/DgP8t5wRFr
The Passionate Dreamer  This is someone who understands their purpose &amp; has started to put in place discipline.  They talk often about recreating their lives. The challenge? They never start.  They can’t pull the trigger and they never move forward.   It becomes just a dream.  https://t.co/jFL4psT8zw
The Problem: Most people get 2 out of 3  When I speak with people who are attempting to design their life with more intention, they generally fall into the “2 out of 3” camp.  These are the 3 combinations that never seem to make it. ↓
Momentum  Momentum in life design is no different than momentum in business.  Creating &amp; seizing opportunity compounds over time, and compound work wins over short-term hacks.   When something works, double down.   When something fails, eliminate or iterate and try again.
Opportunity  Opportunity is one outcome of sharing your ideas.  It attracts other interesting thinkers.   Doing so will help you develop skills.   Use those skills to build assets, and those assets to create income.   With that income, you create more time. The cycle continues.
Creation  The most common form of failure is a failure to start.  Creation is the act of getting started.   We can have motivation, become disciplined, and take accountability for our lives.   But without action, we’re simply dreamers.
3/ Action  Our 3rd bucket is action.  Action moves us from the old life to a new, intentional life.  To create freedom, we must create income.  That comes from owning a corner of the internet.   Action is:   - Creation - Opportunity - Momentum  https://t.co/nW4i7UFNFs
Habits  We have our own internal systems &amp; processes called habits.  If, “how we spend our days is how we spend our lives” is true, then habits are how we spend our days.  Because better habits mean better days, then it’s easy to believe they are a core driver of a better life.
Change  Change means breaking away from the routine &amp; false comfort of the traditional system.  It means doing new &amp; interesting things with new &amp; interesting people.  Only when we extend our comfort zone can we truly grow.  The fishing is often best where the fewest go.
Ownership  Ownership is understanding that you are completely in control of your own life.  Nobody is coming to save you.  Yes, some people have it tougher, while others have it easier. This is factual.  But believing you don't have control fundamentally destroys the concept.
2/ Discipline  Our second bucket is discipline.  Discipline is the group of behavioral drivers that create the proper accountability to grow your purpose:   - Ownership - Change - Habits  https://t.co/JAViYUPYYo
Environment  Your environment is what &amp; whom you surround yourself with.  Time and purpose like a seed, &amp; environment like soil &amp; water.   It’s tough to grow around pessimists, the unreliable, or untrustworthy.  Curating the right environment creates the ecosystem to thrive.
Motivation  Motivation is what drives you. Why are you creating time freedom?   If you’re creating it without specific motivation, it's likely that you will be unfulfilled.   The goal isn't to do nothing.   The goal is to avoid what you dislike and do more of what you love.
Time  We all know that time is our most finite resource.   The currency of life.   But we tend to forget when faced with the day-to-day work, family, and obligations.  Understanding that time is the ultimate currency is the fundamental driver of intentional life design.
1/ Purpose  Our first bucket is purpose.   And I believe purpose is made up of 3 drivers:   - Time - Motivation - Environment  https://t.co/BUZrfqDC31
Your first reaction might be this sounds childlike or fantastical.   I’ve made peace with the potential judgment.  I believe it’s a more natural way to live than the assembly-line, 8-hour workday life we’ve inherited from the 1860s.  Let's start with 3 buckets:
First, what does it mean to design an intentional life?  Here’s what I’ve landed on:  - Doing what I want, when I want, and with whom I want - Doing very little of what I don’t like &amp; more of what I do - Being free of traditional full-time employment - Having limited obligations

@davidshestrin @TMitrosilis Online marketing and social media.
@davidshestrin @TMitrosilis I didn't always have a big following. I started with zero like everyone else.  Here's what I would do:  1. Embrace an obsession 1. Embrace an obsession. can about it. 3. Share everything you learn openly, daily. 4. Do that for 
@FinMaclaren Definitely. Create something you are proud of or don't create it at all.

@SahilBloom It's so much easier to eat this one small bite at a time.
I break down these 4 examples in a recent newsletter issue:  - The pros - The cons - The tech  And more...  Read it here:   https://t.co/E0I3H8fBYE
4. Create a subscription email  Why I like subscription emails:  The scale is incredible.   As the customer base grows, the work effort generally remains the same, meaning that you make a lot more money without much extra work.
3. Start a paid community  Why I like paid communities:  Building a space where people of similar interests can congregate improves your brand, builds trust, &amp; deepens relationships.  This helps grow your audience and build your business.  Get this right and it's powerful!
1. Build a service-based business  Why I like a service-based business:   Generally, easier and lower cost to get started, plus you can likely charge 3x to 5x what you make (hourly) at your 9 to 5 job.
Everyone should have a side hustle that earns $150+ per day.  The problem?  Most people don't know where to begin.  Here are 4 quick examples that might help:  ↓

2 questions Creator Entrepreneurs should ask themselves:  1. Why did I stop?  When you stop scrolling to read something, ask why. Replicate that for your content.  2. Why did I buy?  When you purchase something online, ask why. Replicate that buyer journey.  Easy but overlooked.

@ferventfinance I'm gonna go ahead and trust the power washer with hundreds of great reviews on this one.
@marcuscelestin_ For sure. There's probably an interesting rev share model here where you front the cash to get people the equipment, and they pay you in %.
@meraperspective He had great reviews.
@BrandonGrittini Amazing. I love this.
@_jgoodson Right?
@MatthewRDoan Or just run a business that makes $2k per day and be super satisfied.
@theserhatsozen Good!
@Garrath_R Damn...
@mkhundmiri hahahaha
@dennis_geelen I agree 100%
There's a guy power washing my house right now for $750 and it takes 90 minutes.  Says he's booked out 6 weeks.  Wow.  P.S. Yes I understand there are costs to this business, but goodness...
@SergioRocks Same here, man.  My best comments become posts.
@mattgiaro This is awesome. Reading it now!
@mattbarkercopy Like this:   https://t.co/unBJAQuSZP
@BuzzRobTaylor Nothing worth doing doesn't.
@sagarjainmp  https://t.co/gk0TG5TiaG
@marcuscelestin_ Sure thing, Marcus.
@keyurkumbhare Yep, and you'll have different people following you in 6 months.
@Luke360 Sure thing, Lucas.
@mattbarkercopy Lots of different ones:  - Stories - Observations - Contrarian takes - Listicles - Past vs. Present - Present vs. Future - Threads - 3 Tweets with link  Etc.
@AuthorOnTheSide I often do.   This is a repeated Tweet.
@ItsKieranDrew For sure, Kieran. Why did this work? What can I do more of?
@hey_dhruv Endless, Dhruv.
An easy way to write more Twitter content:  1. Write a Tweet 2. Rewrite it in 6 different ways 3. Schedule it once per month for 6 months 4. Repeat.  Learn to say 1 thing 1,000 ways.  You'll never run out of ideas.

@KateBour I'm laughing so hard at this right now. 😂
The older I get, the more I realize self-confidence makes all the difference.
@sahilkhosla Congrats my man! First of many 🚀
@gbaileycom Thanks, Gregory!
@gbaileycom I'm intentionally not selling anything on Twitter.   I'd rather spend the next 2 years growing past 1M+ followers and then deliver something.
@tspeeg Thanks, Tyler.
@AAvanth I think there is risk in anything, but this seems pretty not risky, IMO.  What about you?
@SahilBloom Tryin'!
@Jayyanginspires Thanks, Jay!
@blakeaburge Excactly. And the kicker is that it's something I'm already doing for myself.
@BrandonFluharty Appreciate you, man! I enjoyed that session tremendously.
@Truman_Writes Yep, that's right, Trumna.
@ThomasKStrider Appreciate that, Thomas.
@IamAndrewEllis Thank you, Andrew.
@Bello_Victor_ Sure thing!
@abdussalampopsy Thanks, Abdussalam!
@abdussalampopsy Certainly a good way to think about it.
@hey_dhruv Thanks, Dhruv!
That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
TL;DR  1. Observe your schedule for recurring knowledge  2. Create a strict cadence for never missing  3. Create a cadence to productize them  4. Use problem/solution to sell
Use the problem to create great awareness marketing and the solution as copy for your landing page.  The goal?   Find other people with that exact problem who need your specific solution.
Step 4: Turn your own problem and solution into sales copy  The best part about selling work you're already doing is that you know exactly why you're doing it.  You know the problem it solves.   You know how it works.   You know how it feels to have the solution in hand.
On the 13th of each month, I spend 30 minutes putting these templates into an email for members.   I add color commentary, show examples, &amp; categorize them by content "style".  I priced it at $9/month to give creators an affordable way to create high-quality content at scale.  https://t.co/tbXHkYqsMF
Step 3: Repurpose into an affordable recurring revenue model  Once you have a cadence for capturing knowledge, next create one for productizing it.  I turned my templates into a subscription for creators looking to improve their content game.  The Monthly Templates were born.  https://t.co/fJZ9WHPJJZ
For example, I started by strictly scheduling the time to find and create new Twitter/LinkedIn templates.  Every Monday at 1:45 pm, I spend 30 minutes finding great content online.   Then at 2:15 pm, I spend 30 minutes turning them into templates I can use and reuse.
Step 2: Create a cadence for capturing knowledge  Once you identify weekly recurring knowledge, you need a cadence &amp; process for capturing it consistently.  If you're going to productize it for recurring revenue, you can't miss or be willy-nilly.   You must deliver consistently.
This is literally something I'm already doing to help with my own content.   And after talking to a few creator friends, they were blown away by the templates I was creating.  I had a hypothesis that this was something I could offer at a low cost to other creators.
Step 1: Check your calendar for routine knowledge creation  For example, part of my own content creation process is curating high-quality styles, formats, and structures for Tweets or LinkedIn posts.   Then, I turn them into templates I can use.  https://t.co/aIVGNK7qhA
Think about the weekly recurring tasks on your calendar related to your career, side hustle, or hobbies.  - Do you write? - Do you project manage? - Do you create automation? - Do you document processes?  If the answer is yes to any of these, you can turn them into revenue.
Once you can learn this process, you'll start to see additional income opportunities almost everywhere you look.  Money here.  Money there.  Money everywhere.  Let's dive in:
I found a $12,258 monthly business hidden on my weekly calendar.   Here's how I noticed it, and how you can too.  🧵  https://t.co/2A15L4Jidk
@HumbleFlow @rebelEducator @torreydawley @dickiebush @SahilBloom @WrongsToWrite @EdLatimore @MentalUnleash @1WrittenNotes @FredosRippleEF Appreciate you!
@agazdecki If you can tell relatable stories, the likelihood that people want to know more about your company is drastically improved.
@heyeaslo Congrats, man! Such a great business you're running.
@growwithcolby Thanks for the mention, Colby. Appreciate it!
@matt_gray_ It sure is. My content works for me 24/7, Matt.
@TheAmineAouragh I think, long-term, you definitely need that.
@mkhundmiri For sure. Great call, Mustafa.
@TnvMadhav I love that addition.
@Albadawee Great comment, Sohaib.
@theficouple I love that. It's important to listen vs. assume you know what to build.
@keyurkumbhare Great point, Keyur.
@notionpunk For sure, Fred.
@Promise_cee That's exactly it.
@HumbleFlow It certainly can be.
@matt_gray_ Great thread, Matt. Glad to be part of the helpful team!
4 skills every solopreneur needs:  - Active listening - Problem-solving - Telling stories - Copywriting  1. Listen for painful problems. 2. Build a predictable solution. 3. Make it relatable through a story. 4. Talk about it daily to attract customers.
@Christofffer I started with Zirtual but eventually found my own person.
@AChenSensation @LeeMcLaren11 @gregisenberg THat's right. I just mean share as you learn on your journey.
@PointONoReturn Not many.
@rodrepairs Thank you, brother!
@SahilBloom Thanks dude. Appreciated.
@blakeaburge Thank you so much man!
@gregisenberg It's gotta be fail-proof for sure.
@ItsKieranDrew I've not familiar with "attention residue". What is that?
How to work with a virtual assistant:  Step 1: Audit Distractions Step 2: Record Process Videos &amp; Docs Step 3: Move To a Trigger-Based System Step 4: Review &amp; Improve Weekly  43,788 just got the full breakdown (plus a free VA worksheet!)  Grab it here:   https://t.co/XJk6vns062

@gregisenberg Thanks. A few people took me literally, but most understood what I meant. Ha.
@rodrepairs @agazdecki Most service businesses here in Nashville are either:  A. Completely unreliable B. Completely booked out  If you have handy skills, anyone could toss up a website, do a little marketing and start pulling in 6-figures here.
@thedankoe People want step-by-step instructions only to find out that life/work/income/success doesn't work that way.
@austinbelcak If you want more {InsertAnything} study sales and marketing.
@agazdecki This is literally "cheat-code" stuff. I love this one, Andrew.
@hey_dhruv Love it, Dhruv. That's the ticket right there.
@AuthorOnTheSide Always by my time, because that's what is most important to me.  So, I'm generally on here 30-60 minutes after I post just engaging and going back and forth.  But, then I shut down and go work on bigger projects.
@Albadawee Haha. Thanks.
@LuisDuquePE So many, Luis.
@jacob_cardy Yep. Simple stuff, too.
@ebube_asadu The 101.
@victor_bigfield No, just build a small group of friends/peers/partners and enjoy working together in public.
A simple 90-day Twitter game plan:  Day 1: Maximize profile: Why should people follow you?  Month 1: "Livestream" your journey: Teach something daily  Month 2: Double down: Turn your best Tweets into threads  Month 3:  Ecosystem: Build a small, relevant network &amp; interact daily
@blakeaburge Just jumped onto your Nerd Alert newsletter. Looking fwd to it, man. Have a great weekend.
@stevelibs11 You realize your likely talking to an impostor account and not me, right?
@mijustin 1. Learn to share openly in a way that attracts people to your journey. (Attract attention)  2. Learn the fundamentals of sales and marketing. (Convert attention to revenue)
@arvidkahl Amen to this.  Use what you know. If you don't know anything, pick the most simple and affordable thing until you have a proven business with traction.
@RahulHakhla @SahilBloom Thanks, man!
@aaditsh 👋
@agazdecki And a very simple way to get started is simply to talk about what you're building, who you're helping, and why you're helping them.
@TMitrosilis The only real mistake is never starting.
@thisiskp_ Thanks for having me, KP :)
@JustinWise I have 4 impostors, am reporting them daily, and @Twitter nor @TwitterSupport will do a damn thing.
@matt_gray_ @TheJoshFarr @JohnIsBuilding @thatroblennon @singhcredible @ted_ryce Thanks, my man.
@Tim_Denning Thanks, homie. You missed yourself!
@rosiesherry A shared mission and purpose.
@graceclarke @aaditsh I used Zirtual for a while and they were excellent. When the VA that was assigned to me left their team, I ended up finding my own.  But I'd highly recommend Zirtual to start.
@austinbelcak Anyone looking for a job can get hired much faster by following this simple plan.
@aaditsh It's a must, Aadit.
@KateBour That's been monumental for me, and I have a way to control the tone and brand so we're all on the same page.
@KurtisHanni Hopefully this will be helpful, Kurtis.
@marcuscelestin_ When you're distracted more than you're focused.
@gregisenberg It's a pretty simple workflow, but man it's been helpful, Greg.
@SahilBloom It's a must, Sahil. The best money I spend each month.
Hiring a virtual assistant is life-changing.  My VA saves me over 40 hours of time per month.  And we created a 5-step workflow that's absolutely killer.  Tomorrow, I'll break down the whole thing in my newsletter.  Join 43,297 entrepreneurs here:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG

@jonbrosio @dickiebush @ItsKieranDrew @alexgarcia_atx @writingtoriches @abhishekshah173 Thank you, my man!
@mjr_47 @TheJoshFarr @dickiebush If you don't look back at your old writing and cringe, you're not getting better.   And this is VERY cringey 😂
Throw your 10-year tactical plan in the trash.  When I look at the people in my network who are on top, most have embraced pivots, chance, and randomness.  They had a vision. They had milestones.  They changed them when data and feedback suggested doing so.
@aaditsh @brandonthezhang @stephsmithio @abhishekshah173 @ybhrdwj @Jake_Langley Appreciate you, man!
@KateBour Thank you 🙌 Right back atcha.
@FitFounder @heydannymiranda @thedankoe @SahilBloom @WrongsToWrite Thanks, Dan!
@TheJoshFarr @dickiebush This was the first thing I ever wrote on the internet that people paid attention to (it's very cringe!):   https://t.co/IPx81yUc0C
@davidfuesser I generally wouldn't, without any context.  Everyone's life is different and money would be helpful in a myriad of positive ways.
@dickiebush Haha. This is so damn true, man. I Tweeted back in the day and ZERO.
@KateBour Works every time.
@thedankoe Damn, those numbers are 🔥 👀
@jatimonen @harrydry Harry's a beast.
@mikefutia They are low, but a few tools are certainly helpful. The money doesn't have to be for tech or anything like that, it could just be to get them out of their current job with enough runway to build.
@bentossell Serendipitous. I love it.  Talk soon!
@andrewglynch @levelsio @charlierward @jakobgreenfeld Every day that goes well feels like a bit more pressure, but that's just because I'm wired that way.  As I get deeper into my 40s, I hope that starts to calm down a bit.  But, of course, I'm very happy
@ChrisPotter361 I already do those things. So, now I'd like to invest in someone else.
@andrewglynch @levelsio @charlierward @jakobgreenfeld Pieter is basically my entrepreneur hero.   I joined NomadList a few years ago without realizing it was his and then got sucked into his story and how he thinks.  I 100% agree.
@nerita_ll @gregisenberg Haha. No investment is needed. (But, thank you)  I'd love to figure out how to build out a creator investment model.
@ThatAndreaM I would assume that money and guidance would make it easier for them to get set up, started, and make fewer mistakes.  Not too dissimilar from investing in a startup.  I'm not looking for anything at the moment, just kicking around an idea.
@ZinterZinter1 @OneJKMolina He's a boss for sure.
@SahilBloom Thanks, man!
@davidfuesser "Check + guidance" was meant to convey $$ + time.
All I want to do is invest in people.   Not companies. Just individual people.   I've come across so many unique creators on Twitter.  I think a small check + some guidance would be all they need to get rolling.  If you could invest in one creator, who would it be?
@useTweetStack I ripped apart the content strategy that had been working for 3+ years for my business after I had one of my worst revenue months in June.  July and August have been my strongest ever.  I wrote about it here:   https://t.co/yrJa5qpjSk
@AlexAndBooks_ Curious as to whether or not this means reading a book, blogs, articles, social media, etc. Would be interesting to learn.
@heyBarsee @Moz @heyeaslo @dribbble @GoodMarketingHQ @wordmancopy @nathanbaugh27 @LizAnnSonders @AlexHormozi Thank you for the kind shout out here!
@Albadawee Thank you!
@gabrielccac Yep.   Self select in or out.   No maybes.
@thegoldsuite Glad it's helpful!
This is just ONE way to write a landing page.  Here's my free guide to building better landing pages for your business.  You can read it in less than 4 minutes and apply it instantly.  I hope you enjoy it.   https://t.co/MrFFMds5f8
Better example:   "Learn how to make your first stock market investment in less than 30 minutes (with zero fees!)"  - Who: People making their first investment - What: Make their first stock market investment - How long: Less than 30 minutes - Objection handler: With zero fees
Bad example:   "Learn how to invest in the stock market."  This outcome is pretty nebulous.   - How much? - How many? - Can anyone do it? - How long will it take?  Those questions are unanswered, plus I have a million objections.
A great landing page is crucial to generating revenue.  The problem?  Most people aren't very good at writing them.  Here are 2 quick examples that might help:  ↓
@MakadiaHarsh @Art0fLife_ @dickiebush @dklineii @visualizevalue @AlexAndBooks_ @nathanbaugh27 @Prathkum Thanks so much, Harsh! Appreciate you.
It feels like 90% of being an solopreneur is taking small but uncomfortable risks.
@Nicolascole77 An opportunity not to be missed.
@BJMendelson @hypefury Oh, that's awesome! Glad it was helpful, BJ.
@SahilBloom Loving these.  Don't strive to be "interesting".  Be interested, become successful, and then people will naturally find you interesting.
@matt_gray_ Great tools here, Matt.
@BrianMarzo18 Haha. Not after a few beers.
@9876ers I try, Sam. Thanks for the great compliment, man.
@mkhundmiri haha. Good way to put it, Mustafa.
@thesandeep_nair @SahilBloom Never stop. It's time to add 'em back in.
@Albadawee I appreciate it, Sohaib
@mattzdoescrypto Of course, Matt.
@mat_pln Haha. Thanks! It is for sure.
@jertheotterbear Daily.
@WithNachit Thank you, Nachit!
@SahilBloom NEVER.
@HeyAmna1 Certainly!
@hey_dhruv It really will, Dhruv.

If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Take every piece of advice in this thread with a grain of salt.  I'm just some random guy on the internet sharing what I've learned.  That doesn't mean it will be 100% true for you.  But, if there is one takeaway, it's this: GET STARTED.  That's how you'll learn your lessons.
44. Everyone has the same 24 hours. It's how you use it. 45. It's not helpful to study Elon and Bezos if you're making $0. 46. Nobody cares about you. They care what you can do for them. 47. Quitters win a lot because they know when to give up.
39. Nobody is coming to save you. 40. Arguing online is a waste of time and energy. 41. Don't be arrogant, but have a mindset that you can do anything. 42. You never know what will resonate. Try a lot of different things. 43. Don't argue with your customers.
34. Use data to create better content. 35. Never plagiarize people but borrow shamelessly. 36. Stop trying to be cool. Be successful. Cool will come. 37. You're a lot less clever than you think you are. Be clear. 38. Be on time for important things. You're not a teenager.
29. Start with one revenue stream, but diversify shortly after. 30. Anyone selling instant results is a con.  31. Systems beat motivation &amp; discipline every time. 32. Quit focusing on tools and tech. Just use what you know. 33. Experiment often, but never with 2 new variables.
23. Promote yourself online every day. 24. Write daily for at least 30 minutes. 25. Ignore haters. They are the least interesting people. 26. Help others and let them reciprocate. If they never do, move on. 27. Go to therapy and be honest. 28. Drink less alcohol.
19. If you can make $1,000 you can probably make $100k. 20. Don't ask random people questions. Ask your customers. 21. You don't need meditation and sunlight. You need action. 22. Don't "find a mentor". Do interesting things &amp; attract mentors.
14. Always over communicate. 15. Assume you can learn something from everyone. 16. Assume everyone you talk to is also full of shit. 17. Your business heroes are regular people who took action. 18. If you can make $1, you can make $1,000.
10. Your network can either speed you up or slow you down. 11. Pessimists are often right, and optimists are often wealthy. 12. Stop asking everyone, and start figuring shit out on your own. 13. If you don't respect people's time, they won't respect you.
6. Thick skin is a prerequisite for building in public. 7. You go 10x faster by supporting people, not tearing them down. 8. No matter how good your product is, someone will hate it. 9. Price whatever you offer at a rate you'd be comfortable paying.
2. If people root for you to fail, cut them out of your life. 3. The best entrepreneurs know how to teach themselves. 4. You learn 100x more by trying than by reading ab someone else. 5. If you don't know how to sell, you're going to struggle.
Every piece of business advice I could come up with after 3 years solo.  1.  Stop reading silly business books and just get started.
@thedankoe Damn. This is like a crash course on productivity.   Well done, Dan.
@dickiebush If you only remember 1 and 5, you're going to be better off than most.
@austinbelcak Yep.   I push solopreneurship because I think people should know it's a viable option.  Not because I think everyone should do it.  Many ways to succeed in this world!
@thedankoe Damn. That's a powerful one, Dan.  Love that reframe.
@agazdecki Yep.   https://t.co/1PE7lPjZuT

@Nicolascole77 I've spent 3+ years replying to social media comments for 45-60 minutes nearly every single day.  It's a competitive differentiator of mine.

@austinbelcak I always want to hire someone with the intrinsics, curiosity, and work effort.
@thedankoe I've been writing a minimum of 30 minutes per day for 3.5 years.  One of the most interesting things I've noticed is how much clearer my thinking has become.  Just one day...it's suddenly very noticeable.  But in reality, it's been happening ov
@agazdecki Solve your own problem and figure out if lots of other people experience the same exact one. If they do, you might be onto something.
@matt_gray_ Great tips, Matt. Very similar to my journey here.

@hypefury TL;DR  Day 1: Maximize your profile: Why should people follow you?  Day 1 to 30: Teach people something every day.  Day 31 to 60: Write 1-2 weekly threads of your best single Tweets.  Day 61 to 90: Build a small network of relevant people and in
@hypefury I use a tool called  https://t.co/dmFMk3T60Y to organize a group of favorite follows, and interact with them easily each day.   By supporting people, I generally earn their support back.  https://t.co/UhgVGJYKkt
@hypefury Jeremy Moser nails it with these 3 tips:
@hypefury Day 61 to 90: Build Your Ecosystem  If you’re resonating with the right people, you’ll likely have some new followers.  This is a great time to set up a small network of people on the same journey as you.   Note: You can also do this on day one 
@hypefury Since you’ve asked a question each day (the PM Tweet), you can also turn the answers into Tweet threads.   This is a very simple way to get started.  I recommend doing 1 thread per week because they maximize your chances of getting attention fro
@hypefury Day 31 to 60: Double Down On Your Best  After 30 days, you’ll have a collection of 90+ Tweets to look back on.   Some of those Tweets will have resonated, while others will be duds.   That’s normal.  Find the Tweets that resonated and double dow
I use a tool called @hypefury that automatically retweets all of my posts 9 hours later.  This helps double my engagement.  It also automatically un-retweets them 24 hours later to keep my Twitter feed clean.
Instead, figure out what you’re obsessed with and bring people along on your journey.   Here’s a simple framework:  AM1: Tweet a simple tip that’s easy to implement.  AM2: Tweet a helpful listicle.  PM: Ask a great question.  https://t.co/0tQbgbHAPN
Day 1 to 30: Livestream Your Journey  I see too many people on Twitter trying to be funny, witty, or clever.   Does it work for a few accounts? Sure.   Is it the best strategy for most people? Probably not.   Twitter growth is NOT about sharing meaningless platitudes.
Pair that with a crisp, professional headshot, and create a banner that supports your bio.   You can do that very easily using something like Canva:  https://t.co/ikeWCUEF3A
1. A catchy moniker: The Diversified Solopreneur (optional)  2. What you’re working on: Building a portfolio of one-person businesses to $5M in revenue.  3. What people can expect when they follow you: Tweets and threads about audience &amp; business growth.  https://t.co/50PvfGLPJC
Day 1: Maximize Your Profile  To begin, it’s critical to understand that you must give people a reason to follow you.   Just Tweeting into the void will do very little if you can’t explicitly state why you’re worth following.  Here’s a great framework for your Twitter profile ↓
There will be no "hacks" in this thread.   Just proven tactics to pick up the perfect followers for you.   People who:  - You can learn from - You can network with - Can be a customer of yours - You can create or share opportunities with  Here's your plan for the next 90 days:

@timwindsor Nope. Went out to everyone!
@ted_ryce Oh, I’m sure. Coaches are awesome.   But it’s imperative to get to $5k or $10k before they are all that valuable.   Generally, that’s where learning on your own comes into play.
@MakadiaHarsh Congrats, Harsh!
@dickiebush The ultimate writing thread. Bookmarking!
@TMitrosilis Great thread, Teddy. Fear keeps so many people from moving forward. This is an awesome tactical approach.
@jspector I think there are 2 different phases:  Phase 1: Growth (mostly) on your own. You need to get some traction w/o accelerators. It's the best way to become a better creator.  Phase 2: Add in the things from above. No other big creators engaged w/ m
@brianbeers Haha. Yep. We're all guilty of this, man. Myself included.

@_Alex_Adamov It really does, Alex. It takes the fun out of the whole process.
@BenjaminPutano Good catch. It's a competition with ourselves.
@TheAmineAouragh That's a great point, Amine.
@TheJoshFarr Same here, Josh.
@dickiebush Wow. I'm going deep forest soon.
@Nicolascole77 Category ownership, not 174th best in a large topic.
@thedankoe Not just related to confidence, but also to empathy.   Everyone you've been told to hate, and every perspective you've been told is wrong, likely have more to the story.   Go out and learn about everyone and everything.
@AlexAndBooks_ Loved last week's issue, Alex. Looking fwd to it, man.
@SahilBloom True story.
@MakadiaHarsh Thanks, Harsh!
@NoCodeHunter Exactly.
Solopreneurship 101:  Don't compare yourself to others.  That's the easiest way to get distracted and stressed out.  You can only control how successful you are, not how successful someone else is.  Be the best version of yourself, not a better version of someone else.
@vickks Thanks, Vivek. Hope you’re well!
@spacemakerco When I’m interested in something I usually will research it for hours and then go try it.   I think some of it is just natural curiosity.
A critical skill in solopreneurship is to learn how to teach yourself.   Mentors are great, but generally provide advice that worked for them.  Do your own research by deeply immersing yourself in whatever subject is important to you.   Learn to learn and you're unstoppable.
@AlmerudCaspian Genuinely curious question - do you use restaurant reviews or reviews of physicians or other businesses?
@AdsFunnelSales Thanks, ALan!
@_jgoodson How is a client different than a customer? Want to make sure I understand the question.

@TheJoshFarr That's awesome, man! Glad you're here.
Today I received my 250th customer testimonial.  These are massively impactful on my landing page.  Here are 3 ways to collect more testimonials:  - Use the tit-for-tat method - Automate the process - Be hyper-specific  Join 42k learning more tomorrow:   https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
@jspector Spot on, my man.   Doing things will always be the best way to actually learn and progress.
@dickiebush Love that, Dickie.
@TMitrosilis Love that, Teddy.
@oledoteth @SahilBloom It's so true. I feel like this all of the time.
@wes_kao Damn, that's true, Wes. A win/win I hadn't even considered.
@SahilBloom I've found this to be the biggest truth out there. When I share, I'm always stunned to find out how many people don't know it.
@TheRobbMann I love this.
@blakeaburge Oh, amazing! So glad, brother. Thank you.
@TheJoshFarr Smart, Josh.
@SeanPHogue It's a good one, Sean!
Want better Twitter content?  Take what you learned over the last 30 days &amp; ask yourself:   - What can I teach someone? - What did I observe during the journey? - How is this different than what others say? - What tools, books, or articles helped?   https://t.co/x6Rz5vGVEa
The biggest difference between success &amp; failure is getting started.  The majority of people I know fantasize about things that actually can be accomplished.  They just never get started.  If you get started and play the long game, you have a great chance of winning.
@AkBakhshi Thank you so much!
@agazdecki I see this a lot with companies moving from SMB to Enterprise. 99% of the time, they just aren't ready.
@Nicolascole77 I'm going to win simply by outlasting a lot of people...
@thedankoe Group think is literally dividing the world.
@blakeaburge Everyone sees the tip of the iceberg.
@KateBour This opening Tweet is a masterclass on effective "hook" writing. Well done.

@ebube_asadu Keep going!
@ThomasKStrider I think they certainly are a big part.
@notionpunk Nice. Keep going, Fred!
@ItsKieranDrew Similar to me. The journey to 70k was very difficult, but then suddenly the journey accelerated.
@TheJoshFarr Love that, Josh.
@ishverduzco @gregisenberg @thesamparr @ShaanVP @HTTOTW @NaithanJones Appreciate the shout here, Ish!
@jappleby For sure. I don't even think about algorithms when posting. I figure, in the end, it will all work out if I learn to produce quality content.

A lot of people say, "Quality over quantity".  Sometimes.  But when you're starting a new endeavor, repetition matters.  So start with quantity to help find the quality.  Then do both.  High output, high quality. Win/Win.
@SachinRamje Dude, this is amazing! Thank you so much for it.
@barrettjoneill @OneJKMolina Damn. Thanks, fellas. I appreciate that.
@helloakashm Sure, but choose a different number like 1% or 0.5% and rework the math.
@Kevin_Loder I've done $781,400 in course sales this year with zero ad spend 🙂
@AkBakhshi Great question. I'll create something about that.
@matt_gray_ Loving the visuals, Matt.
@sweatystartup Thanks, man.   It's the only way I can operate is by having small breakdowns and tactical action plans.
@Richard_andey That's right, Andrew.
@AdamsIshakuAli Definitely. It's not easy at all. But it's easier than not having a plan.
@oledoteth For sure.
@KateBour 100%, Katelyn.  I find this to be my favorite way to goal set and then I love to turn these into small, actionable plans.
@dennis_geelen So much more attainable.   It also gives you a plan.
@TheJoshFarr For sure, Josh. That's the ticket.
@LeeMcLaren11 Eat the elephant one bite at a time.
@Reid_HF Also a very viable way.
@insightjuice For sure, Joe.
@ItsKieranDrew Love that, Kieran. That's a great way to approach this.
The math behind a $250k per year online business:  - $20.8k per month - Which is $695/day - Which is 7 customers at $99/each - Which is 475 web visitors/day at 1.5% conversion  Mind you, none of this is easy.  But it's easier than staring $250k in the face with no plan.
@jonnym1ller @schlaf Yep. Probably the wrong choice of word.  Hopefully the thought still makes sense.
@realBrookNash It's not a cure. Just something to practice and be cognizant of.
@schlaf That’s a great point here, Steve.   My therapist talked me through this last week and you’re exactly right. Moments that must be surfed.
Anger is about what happened in the past.  Anxiety is about what will happen in the future.  The best way to alleviate these issues is to build a habit of operating in the present.
@schlaf HBD! 🍰
@rodrepairs @Nicolascole77 Congratulations, man!

@gregisenberg If I need to get started on TikTok, I'm coming to you. I pray I don't :)
@aaditsh Congrats on the newsletter growth, Aadit!
@agazdecki Define the mission and that north star, then find the best crew who is pumped to row the boat in that direction.
@KateBour Such a fantastic newsletter, Katelyn. Just saw mine in my inbox.
@TMitrosilis People don't realize that the long-term mindset actually leads to the short-term pleasures.   And they tend to stick around for life when you approach it the right way.
@Nicolascole77 Love these. Here's one I recently learned that has been impactful for me:  Happiness is not a destination, it's a moment.  I used to think, "I'll be happy when X" or "I'll be happy once I do Y"  Now, I embrace each moment of happiness and l
@rodrepairs @Nicolascole77 I would kill for a handyman.  I'm the least handy person on earth and we cannot find anyone responsible or timely in Nashville.   Someone just needs to step up and walk into 6-figures.
@DogGuyJosh @sweatystartup Sometimes.   Some entrepreneurs identify a need and then turn it into a want.   Some entrepreneurs identify a need and set up shop where people are looking.
@DogGuyJosh @sweatystartup Hahaha. I've been proven wrong in one, simple Calvin and Hobbes frame.
@jakobwhte Thanks, Jakob!
@GabeMarusca Certainly one of them, Gabe.
@BERG_NYC It's an interview in the Wildsam Hudson Valley Travel guide.
@SahilBloom It's an interview in the Wildsam Hudson Valley Travel guide. I read that and thought, "That's a smart, simple, guy there".
@jasonstrimpel The great part is sometimes they will tell you without you even asking. Most people just aren't listening.
@Albadawee Love it, Sohaib.

@ReadeMilner @ItsKieranDrew It's optional too. Wait until you've nailed a category and then add it.

@edgady Awesome! Keep going please.
@TMitrosilis Someone ranted against my choice of lifestyle yesterday online.   Weird huh?
@matt_gray_ Nice stuff here, Matt. How’s beehiiv been for you??
@blakeaburge Owning this niche man.
@agazdecki Appreciate you my man.
@SimonHoiberg *although
@LuckyLuke0x Over complication and procrastination.
@KurtisHanni That’s my goal.
@SimonHoiberg Agreed. I’ve been pretty open about VAs and Al thought I’ve contracted small things out in the last, it’s extremely rare.   Maybe 3x in 3 years.
@jappleby One part-time VA
@BlackLabelAdvsr I have Part-time VA.
I'll tell anyone who will listen about a one-person, diversified business model.  You can hate it, doubt it, say it won't work, or think it's impossible.  But you can't unsee it.
@rczyxc If you check my account you’ll notice I actually only “Tweet” about 2x per day.   The rest of that number is replies to comments and to other people’s tweets (like this).   Hope that helps take some pressure off.
@bruno_nwogu @thejustinwe1sh There have been hundreds.   Nothing I can do about it.
@NeelBParekh @PEfund_guy It’s about to get significantly better with the September 5th update as well.
@NeelBParekh @joostschuur About 30% of the time.   Another 20% of the time I riff on old posts.  Another 20%, I use content from longer-form stuff I've written.  And 30% is purely original.
@PedroCastenada Here's a common path:  1. Service business 2. Productiuzing the service 3. Adding a recurring subscription 4. Building out a community 5. Cohort coaching 6. Sponsors
@C47 😂
@C47 Yep, that's better!
@joostschuur @NeelBParekh That could be true. That's why proper diligence is needed in every space.  I heard the same thing from everyone in my space as well, but I've sold over 8,000 copies at $150.
@Truman_Writes No worries ! 😀
@Truman_Writes Because I already have a portfolio of revenue streams. That was my goal.
@IAmAnasAmrani Or learn to understand that the worst case scenario isn't often all that bad.
@Truman_Writes Trying to leave what?
@notionpunk Every small income stream that works out is just another  point towards derisking your life.
@RealJoshHoward Same, Josh.
@TheJoshFarr Nice, Josh. Agreed.
@finance_toolbox Sweet! Congrats :)
@chrishlad IMO, focus and intensity are for things that have been proven.  You can't find out what's proven without several small attempts.  Try something. If it sticks after a while and you enjoy it, invest more time there.
More people should build a portfolio of revenue.  There's almost no downside &amp; tremendous upside:  - Worst case is you fail and stay in the same situation - Best case is you unlock a much better life  What's the easiest way you could make $1 online this weekend?  Try that thing.
@wes_kao I love how you've given some really simple, but extremely powerful examples here, Wes.  Great thread.
@nurijanian I don't much about it, but plan on looking into this in 2023.
@TheRealJohnnyB7 It was a platform I knew other people were creating on, so it made sense to me at that time. It worked out well.
@TnvMadhav Yep.

@dickiebush Given the reviews I'm reading about your previous cohorts, I think this will be your largest group ever.   Good luck, fellas!
@thedankoe The best way to learn how to reach a major goal is simply to be obsessed with it and curious about it.  Curiosity + obsession has always worked for me.
@KateBour One of the biggest sins in business is not talking to your customers.  It's amazing how many people don't.

@AkBakhshi Best selling is all about the creator.   Most impacted is all about the student.
@IdeasActualized The latter is exactly how I built my business and I’ve been successful for 3+ years.
@NeelBParekh I think for $1,000+ you need it to be more robust and probably longer.   I just think people underestimate the social capital needed to sell a course at that price.
@BigWillieStein hell yeah! Thanks, Will
@dickiebush Threads on threads on threads from the S30for30 team today.  It's a writer's extravaganza!  https://t.co/Ss40nhmqu6
@valhalla_dev I charge $150 and my one of my courses is a little under 2 hours and one is 50 minutes.
@TheJoshFarr @Johnson_AsiNG One of my courses is 2 hours, one is 50 minutes. But if you're building your first one, try and keep it between 45 and 60 total.   You can always go longer once you have social capital and a large following.
@robertoblake My take would be that most people who say that likely haven't built anything of their own and would struggle to describe why it's unethical. It's a nitpick and a teardown, vs. a valid concern.   When people love my course, they recommend it.
@hanno_roedger @KateBour Thank you!
How to build a successful online course:  - Keep your course between 45 &amp; 60 minutes - Focus on 100x info value, not production value - Make sure students achieve one specific outcome - Automate and heavily incentivize affiliate students  This has been my game plan for 3 years.
@ndwignall @dcprudhomme I sent the email to 38k, opened by 60% so 22.8k and now clicks are at 1,208 so 5.3% of open.
@ritendn My overall CTR was about that, but that includes other links.
@thedeepikashah I don't know...  What are you trying to accomplish?
@ndwignall About 5.3%.  Is that good? I'm new to sponsorships.
@Emmanuel__Alex Thank you, Emmanuel.
@thealibilawal I appreciate that brother. Hope you're well!
@ritendn So far, so good. Will continue experimenting. Already have some big brands that booked.

@lucasprigge Looking fwd to seeing how this came out. Thanks for having me, Lucas.
@Nicolascole77 The little red book of writing right here
@austinbelcak What a jam-packed, useful thread, Austin.  Gold.
@creation247 I was just shy when I started mine.  It was nice to know that I had a lot to fall back on rather than burning the bridges with no safety net.
@matt_gray_ Tiny habits, in aggregate, make large habits.
@Nicolascole77 #2 is key here, Cole. Once you take writing off of your website and put it out into social environments, feedback comes fast and furious.   A great way to learn.
@thedankoe Formal education provides a foundation of things that have been learned in the past.  Acquiring skills outside of school shows you what's possible in the future.  Combining them is a lot of fun.
@ken_carroll Well, hell...thanks, Ken.
@TheRobbMann Let's DO it, Rob.
@thedankoe Same here, Dan.
@NHammondDesign Then sure! :)
@TheJoshFarr That's exactly it, Josh.
@SimonHoiberg Ha. I love that. That's my exact style.

@insightjuice That is a great quote, Joe.
@hey_dhruv Agreed.
The popular narrative:  "He risked it all, tripled down, 110% effort, 24/7, no plan B because backup plans means you're not committed!"  The better narrative:  "She found an hour each day to grow a side project, replaced 60%-70% of  her income, then jumped all in."

@Nicolascole77 The book is a great lead magnet.   If you can use the cost of your book to acquire a customer via a paid channel and then send that customer to a course or SaaS...  You're operating a $0 CAC with thousands of dollars of LTV.   WOW.
@thedankoe This is one massive epiphany I had over the last 2 years.  The urge to keep up with others is toxic.  Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing enough because I see someone else's success, only to realize that I wouldn't want to do what they do, to g

By using this strategy, I rarely have to ask people to buy my products.  Instead, it becomes a simple numbers game:   Impressions → visitors → product views → $$  No sales tactics. No tacky promotions. No aggressive pressure.  Just a hub and spoke model that drives $$.
Of those 3,100 people who entered my website on July 21st, 97 purchased a course from me for a total of $6,476 gross and $6,240 net.  https://t.co/XDwFAMJ6n3
And every newsletter issue I write positions my products passively at the end.  Nothing aggressive.   Just informative:  https://t.co/p0Xk1SpSnr
Results:  Of those 176,800 impressions on that LinkedIn post 3,100+ people entered my website on that specific newsletter issue (6.11.2022) and started reading.  You can see that clearly in my analytics below:  https://t.co/nlfhQajllI
Point social content back to the Hub piece with a CTA:  Point the CTA at the end, back to the relevant newsletter.  I use the word "steal" here because it entices people.  If they want to learn more, they can click and dive deeper into my weekly productivity system.  Relevancy!  https://t.co/kQWZ3RDvjT
This post generated over 176,800 impressions from readers who are interested in better content.  But, remember, our goal is to move them from impression to website visitor.   So, next…  https://t.co/op2gO338oB
Stagger the content over 6 weeks:  I do this because I don’t want to talk about the same thing every single day.  But, now, whenever I do post, I can easily link back to the newsletter.  For example, I scheduled the “Observation” piece to be published 6 weeks later, on July 21st.  https://t.co/ebalUI21WZ
My 6 favorites are:  - Stories - Observations - Twitter threads - Contrarian takes - Past vs. present - Listicles  With this model, you no longer have to ask “What should I write about today?”  You just lean on the Hub content.  Our Hub and Spoke model now looks like this:  https://t.co/gAJEQnVcUT
Chop your Hub content into 6 Spokes:  Once I have my newsletter done, I want to create social media posts that are related to that particular issue.  These will be the “Spokes” of our Hub and Spoke model.  There are 6 pieces of Spoke content that I love creating:
Create a Hub piece of long-form content:  We’re going to start with a Hub piece of long-form content, like a:   - Newsletter - Podcast - Video  My Hub piece of content is my Saturday newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.  In June, I wrote this issue about content production:  https://t.co/ikArSxvlUQ
There are far more than just monetary benefits to this:  1. It’s easier to stay focused 2. It’s easier to create more relevant content, faster 3. You’re sales pitch and "asks" will be way more natural 4. You’ll show off your deep expertise in your topic of choice  Let's dive in:
I made $142,000 selling online courses in July.  That's a 50.7% improvement from June.  It's all from a new content &amp; monetization strategy.  Steal it for your business here:  🧵  https://t.co/DYnRU3mTbZ

@tdinh_me Thanks for building such a great tool, Tony.  I'm loving it.
@TMitrosilis Audience is a recurring group of people with whom you interact.  Distribution is learning how to leverage that channel to create revenue.

@dickiebush 1 idea, 1 block of time, 1 tab.
@arvidkahl I really enjoyed Factfulness by Hans Rosling.  At a time when I felt really downtrodden about the world, it provided a better lens through which to view it.  I still read it once per year.
@thedankoe Do this each morning for either a 5-mile outside walk or a 3-mile treadmill walk.  Urge is always there, but this is the best creative time (for me).  Stay off that phone.
@Nicolascole77 The romantic notion of sitting in a log cabin, writing for years and releasing some smash hit is highly unlikely.  Just publish daily for your readers and follow their signals.  (a lot less lonely too!)
@ericleynolds I think that's probably pretty true.
@TKAllDay62 For sure. That's why I recommend getting deep on one before moving to another.
@SeanPHogue It certainly does, Sean. You're learning and growing and that's what matters.
@CharlesNwani_ Absolutely, Charles.
@jacob_cardy Yep.
@GabeMarusca I'd focus on whatever has the lowest barrier to entry for you personally.

The most successful creators are always building leverage:  - Capital - Network - Audience - Community - Distribution - Productization  Choose a path, get to 100%, and then add another.  Diversified leverage maximizes your chance of success.

3 Lies About Solopreneurship:  1. It's risky: I've seen more people go from $300k to $0 overnight w/ layoffs than fail as solopreneurs  2 You have no help: I have an incredible spouse, VA, and support system.  3. You must go all in: Diversifying my revenue has created stability.
@SeanAnthonySays Thank you, my friend. Much appreciated.
@dickiebush Thank you, my man!
@thedankoe Thank you, Dan!
@benjaminbseiler Definitely. I just think doing 1 meaningful thing each day is helpful. Could just be a bike ride, a great conversation, or a few pages of a book.

@dvassallo Partner that with a solid recurring revenue stream, and you've just increased survival rate.
@agazdecki You've got that playbook down, my man.
@yakshitshh Do something much smaller.  Read 5 pages. Go for a 10-minute walk. Talk to a smart friend.  All of those make it a better day than zero.

Lesson #24: Stand for something (but not everything)  While it's important to fight for your causes, you can't please everyone.  You'll never "do right" by 100% of people, so don't try and don't worry about it.  Know your values. Stay 100% true to them. Move the mission forward.
Lesson #23: Speak up  When you see something wrong, say something.  If you feel strongly about a cause, speak up about it.  Only wimps run their business with zero personality and avoid all conflict.  What's the point of getting wealthy if you're not true to yourself?
Lesson #22: Use data and your ears  "Data is everything".  No, it isn't.   I've built a multi-million dollar one-person business &amp; a $70M SaaS.  Data is important, but it doesn't say everything.  Get out and talk to people, especially your customers.  Quantitative &amp; Qualitative
Lesson #21: Say no more often  I know your uncle's dog-sitter has a podcast with 9 listeners, but you have friends and family who want to spend time with you.  And you've got a business to build.  When you say yes to everything, you're saying no to family and friends.
Lesson #20: Get paid so you can help others  Most people have a crap relationship with money.  If you do, you become one of those people who think they're helping because they complain on the internet all day long. Silly.  Money drives change.  Get some so you can actually help.
Lesson #19: Understand your hourly value  Once you find a price that people are willing to pay you, ignore those who aren't.  Your job isn't to service everyone, it's to be the exact right solution for the exactly right customer.   Know your value and don't waver.
Lesson #18: Take lots of small risks  Everyone wants to be successful and wealthy, but nobody wants to get out of their comfort zone.  It doesn't work that way.  Don't make silly mistakes, but move to that place, start that thing, publish that content, and get on that stage.
Lesson #17: Cut people who don't reciprocate  The healthiest way to show that you're invested in a relationship is to reciprocate.  If you're always there for someone and they aren't there for you?  Cancel that relationship.   It's a two-way street.
Lesson #16: Read the room  Do people cut you off constantly in the middle of explaining things?  You probably talk too much. Stop.  Constantly arguing?   You probably don't listen enough. Start.  Ask people how you can improve and be open to their suggestions.
Lesson #15: Don't be a liability  Everyone is f*cking busy.  Nobody has a bunch of free time to pander to someone who can't even take 10 seconds to Google how something works.  If you can't function on your own, you're a liability.  Don't be one.
Lesson #14: Ignore the hate  No matter what you choose to do, someone will hate it.  But, they don't really hate you or your business.  They hate themselves and they express it by tearing successful people down.  Block and move on.
Lesson #13: Look out for number one  You'll never find time for your friends, family, and business if you can't learn how to say no to things that are less important.  "You can't help the world until you help yourself" - Kendrick Lamar  Get yourself right, then go help others.
Lesson #12: Average competence is enough  90% of the people that I meet who are successful don't have a superior intellect.  Sure, they're usually decently intelligent, but rarely "genius".  They have a bias toward action and learn from everything that happens.  That's it.
Lesson #11: Learn to accept responsibility  Learning to take responsibility for your failures is an epiphany-like moment.  If it's always somebody's fault or some company's fault, you're never going to grow.  People who blame everyone but themselves are cancer to business.
Lesson #10: Your knowledge has value  Once you begin to learn valuable information, you'll forget what it was like NOT to know it.  But, amazingly, the stuff we think everyone knows?  They don't.  Your knowledge is valuable and should be treated as such.  Don't forget that.
Lesson #9: Expertise is subjective  Most people don't get started because they think:  "I'm not an expert!"   Nonsense.  Everyone's an expert compared to someone else.   Find those people a few steps behind you on the journey and you have an audience that views you as one.
Lesson #8: No "zero" days  A "zero" day is when you do nothing to push yourself forward.  Don't have those days.  That doesn't mean "don't take time off" or "don't vacation".  Hustle 24/7 is silly.  1 meaningful conversation or reading 5 pages means you're advancing.
Lesson #7: Be auto-didactic  If you can't learn to teach yourself, then you're going to struggle to build anything meaningful.  I don't have all the answers. Google doesn't have all the answers. Your mentor doesn't have all the answers.  Go learn by doing things on your own.
Lesson #6: Learn to write  There is no better skill for marketing yourself and your business than writing.  Write every single day.  Don't even worry about if it's good. Just do it.  If you do, you'll look back one day and realize just how much better you've become.
Lesson #5: Comparison really is a thief  Don't compare where you are at, to where I'm at or anyone else.  We're all running completely different races with totally different start dates.  Don't worry about anyone else.  Just finish your race.
Lesson #4: Audit your environment  You can't win surrounded by pessimists &amp; haters.  Nothing will help you accelerate faster than by surrounding yourself with high-quality, high-integrity, motivated, optimistic people.  People either give you energy or take it.   Choose wisely.
Lesson #3: Persistence pays  If you believe in your idea, stick with it.  You'll hear some "No's". That's to be expected!  Don't be defeated, but also don't do the same thing if ALL you're hearing is "No."  Learn from the no's and adjust your strategy accordingly.
Lesson #2: Consistency wins  The best builders tend to show up every single day.  Are there cases where this isn't true? Certainly.  Is it true in 90% of the best business builders I talk to? Yes.  Sometimes, being the last person standing wins.
Lesson #1: Just start  The most prolific business builders don't procrastinate or wait until everything is "perfect".  It never will be.  They simply start, then learn as they go.  Have an idea? Put it out into the market and test it out.

@luisgdelafuente Ha. Wasn't trying to be cynical, just realistic.  I wish more well-intentioned people were serial self-promoters.  I'm trying to fill that gap :)
@luisgdelafuente Depends on your definition of "best". Most of the people who are "best" at their thing are too scared to tell anyone about it.  Therefore, you get serial self-promoters at the top. They went for it and got it.
@TheRobbMann Awesome thread, Rob.  Appreciate you including me here!
The luckiest people I know have coincidentally been working hard for decades.
@dickiebush Great thread man.   I’ve found that writing is mostly about having a good idea. That’s why I prioritize the walking and ideating.

@ShaanVP @carrd Choose a reasonable price point:  Start with a price that people are willing to pay.  But make it 2x to 3x what you make at work.  For example, if you make $100k at work, that's basically $50/hour.  Try $150/hour.  Experiment often to find

Create Red Pill content around one challenge:  "Red pill" content is something I heard @ShaanVP say and I've never forgotten it.  Your content should present a new take. A new angle.  A different approach than other people take to solve a challenge.  Be different.
Clean up your profiles:  Your social media profiles are mini landing pages.  With one glance, prospects should know:  - Who you are - What journey you are on - What people should expect if they follow you  Capture attention by being clear, not clever.

That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
Funnel People To Your Website:  There's a workaround for linking out on LinkedIn.  Write a good long-form piece of content, and add a link at the bottom.  Close out the "preview" image and then post.  20% reduction in impressions doesn't matter when your CTR is improved 6x!  https://t.co/QJeoGqWicV
LinkedIn Newsletter:  You can apply for, and get a LinkedIn newsletter easily.  When you launch your newsletter's first issue, LinkedIn will promote it to all of your followers.  That's why it's good to get 10k to 15k followers first, then launch.  https://t.co/8GwLUmGdsv
Notification Bell:  It used to be that LinkedIn didn't have a notification bell, like Twitter.  That changed a few months ago.  Now, you can set it up to receive notifications for when your favorite creators drop new content.  https://t.co/bKcbjyVAvg
Carousel Posts:  Last week, LinkedIn officially rolled out their carousel beta and people are taking advantage of them.  Just create a 4X5 inch Canva PDF and upload it.  Easy win.  https://t.co/MbrbtpsYJs
Profile URL Link:  I drive at least 100 people to my website each day via the new LinkedIn profile URL.  You simply edit your profile, scroll to the bottom and add a link.  Similar to a link in your Twitter bio, but can be edited to display as a CTA.  https://t.co/w8q0YnyMGJ
Leverage Little-Known Features:  Here are a few little-known features you can use to grow:  1. Profile URL link 2. Carousel posts 3. Notification bell 4. LinkedIn Newsletter
Interact With Top Creators:  When I was getting started, I wanted to build a high-quality network.  Here's how:  1. Shared a resource 2. Engaged with their content 3. Featured them in my newsletter 4. Praised something specific they did 5. Introduced them to someone meaningful
Recycle for 2x Engagement:  After 3 years, I have over 1,500 pieces of unique content.  So, for my 2nd post (Noon CST), I recycle.  I go back 365 days and update a piece of content from last year.  There are 100k+ new followers who never saw it.  And most people won't remember.
The Takeaway &amp; CTC:  My goal at the end is to give the reader a nice little takeaway.   Think of it as the last thing they'll remember reading before I call them to the conversation with a simple question.  Like this:  https://t.co/ghauZJuxAm
The Trailer:  The next part of the content I create is the "trailer."  The trailer is the opener and has 2 jobs:  - Break the scroll pattern with the first line. - Make each line intriguing enough to get the reader to the next.  Here's the trailer for that piece of content.  https://t.co/oEUFwxpmRE
The Meat:  The first thing I do is create "the meat" of the content.   This is where you’re teaching something.  It’s the information you want to convey.  In this example, I am teaching 10 steps that help build your first side hustle:  https://t.co/bL8DDXYaSb
Write High-Performance Content:  High-performance LinkedIn content has 3 different parts:  - The Meat - The Trailer - The takeaway &amp; CTC  I use this to write a piece of content each morning at 7:15a CST.  Here's how it works ↓
Featured Section:  This section is a lot like a pinned Tweet but more powerful.  Use it to deplatform to a newsletter, podcast, or YouTube channel.  Have a product? Let people buy it if they are ready.   Different options for different stages of a journey.  Next up? Content.  https://t.co/ig0vWk805X
About Section:  Your about section is all about social proof.  That means it's time to brag!  - What have you done in your career that makes you worth following? - What are your customers saying about your business? - What awards have you won?  Don't be shy.  Show off.  https://t.co/NgepXPhZJF
Tagline:  Your tagline is often a make-or-break moment.  The goal of the tagline is three-fold:  - Tell people who you are - Tell people what you're working on - Tell people what they should expect if they follow you  It's not time to be cute or clever.  It's time to be clear.  https://t.co/DELZcNzBn2
Headshot:  Headshots should evoke a feeling:  - Kind - Tough - Playful - Powerful - Empathetic - Professional  Your headshot should align with your brand. I sourced a specific photographer to get the headshot that evokes a feeling of confidence.  A terrific investment.  https://t.co/40eghqzI0C
Banner Image:  The first thing people see on your profile is your banner image.  Use it to achieve a specific outcome:  - Build brand awareness - Drive newsletter sign-ups - Send people to your website - Sell a digital product or service - Get them to follow you on social media  https://t.co/nzqPcuedc3
Design A Profile That Converts:  Here is the journey of a prospective follower.  1) Reads your content 2) Clicks your profile 3) Sees your banner 4) Looks at your headshot 5) Reads your tagline 6) Reads your about section 7) Checks your featured section 8) Follows or doesn't  https://t.co/2JHKKvW6eN
Inside of this thread, you'll learn how to:  1. Design a profile that converts 2. Write content that goes wild 3. Recycle for 2x engagement 4. Interact with top creators 5. Leverage little-known features 6. Funnel people to your website  And more.  Let's dive in.
Twitter hates LinkedIn.  But I'll do 130M+ impressions &amp; $1.4M on the platform in 2022.   Here's how I use LinkedIn unlike anyone else:  🧵
@shushant_l @tibo_maker @arvidkahl @thisiskp_ @sveta_bay @5harath @sauravarya @HainingMax @theadityapati @heyeaslo @thecodaguy @NoCodeCreative @aagreet Thanks, man!

@TheRahulMall I agree, Rahul.
@MakadiaHarsh Good stuff, Harsh.
@shushant_l Great thing to study, Shushant.
@Johnson_AsiNG Certainly, Johnson.
@phol_huynh I wrote a whole thread about it:   https://t.co/Xpwydl4DcC
@naman_designs Also really good ones, Naman.
@luke_netti So far, Luke.
@keyurkumbhare Agreed, Keyur.
@ionalpha_ True, but within character limitations, these are most important IMO.
@juancolamendy Good call, Juan Carlos.
@jamie_dru Definitely one I forgot, Jamie.
@hey_dhruv I agree, Dhruv!
Every solopreneur should study:  1. Human psychology 2. Outsourcing 3. Copywriting 4. Community 5. Storytelling 6. Delegation 7. Persuasion 8. Empathy 9. Selling  I'm sure I'm missing something, but these are key.
@NeelBParekh Both.   I’ve done about $1.5M on impulse buy products at a $130 ARPU and 95% margin, and I assume this install base will feed higher ticket products in the future (although unproven at the moment.)
@Kaushik_901 Lots of information about this on my website:  https://t.co/64c9clqIuz
@MarkPraschan  https://t.co/64c9clqIuz
@drernestomd Absolutely, Dr. Ernesto!
I've built a million-dollar business on "Trust Tripwires"  Affordable products that:  - Can be an easy impulse buy - Provide 100x in value vs. the cost - Build deep trust to grow future sales - Generate word-of-mouth through sheer quantity  An option everyone should consider.
@singhcredible @ShaanVP @ItsKieranDrew @blakeaburge @SahilBloom @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Thanks, Jeremy!
@arvidkahl One thing you might try is shortening up the "Bootstrapped Founder #146" to "BF #146".  You'll notice I chose "TSS" instead of "The Saturday Solopreneur" so the length doesn't bleed the actual subject line off of the page.  LMK if that makes se
@brendancahill_ @Its_Jenn_Here I don't think so!
@willstew Such a great time, Will.
@dickiebush So funny man. Lo-Fi is my go to!
@DrFord407 For sure, Brent.
@AdsFunnelCoach Thanks, Alan.
@CheetSheets And very few are providing high-quality customer service.
@LouMalnatis @craigwoodson @ChicagoCut @murphysbleacher I'd love to see you too 🍕
@henwalkco Right??
@sachdevasampark That's what I've found, Sampark.
@insightjuice 100%
@brendancahill_ It's such a shame.
@TheCoolestCool Simple things, man.  I try to get back to people within 2-3 hours at latest, and with a happy, cheerful demeanor that's focused on solving their issue.  Ya know...mind-blowing stuff.
Customer service has plummeted since COVID hit.  This is a massive opportunity to stand out:  - Rapid email responses - Cheery demeanor - Flexibility  Great customer service used to be par for the course.  Now I see it as a competitive differentiator.   Surprise &amp; Delight.
@Nicolascole77 ❄️  I want it now, but I'll still pay you for it later :)
@KateBour One of my faves! Congrats on crossing 14k, Katelyn.
@TKAllDay62 Boom!
@DocMikeWrites Thanks, Doc!
@oledoteth Don't start from scratch. Just work to build great content and keep at it.
@KalimoLeboela It's a helpful framework to write valuable stuff rather than impressing with philosophical one-liners.
@AkBakhshi Thanks, Akbar!
@declan_writes Thanks, Declan!
@spacemakerco Something related to your journey, what you tall about, etc.
@pyewaw Hell yeah, Pye.
@KurtisHanni Like great threads!
@hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv.

@arvidkahl All advice requires context.   That’s why my FAQ page has this:  https://t.co/qxk8Uz17E5
Twitter observation:  Accounts growing crazy fast don't have the best content.  They have:  1. A clear profile: What are they doing? Why should you follow? 2. Helpful content: Educating their audience daily 3. Deep network:  They engage regularly  Nothing fancy.  All meaningful.
@davidfuesser @dickiebush Hmm. I don't feel like I "curate content". I just share lessons I've learned from my own journey.  Oh well. I'll take the compliment either way 😀
@dickiebush What about short, original thinking? I feel like that's where mine fits in. Looking fwd to seeing how you frame this up!
@dvassallo What's the saying? Pessimists are often right, while optimists are often wealthy?
@thedankoe Most people let the game play them, and spend most of their time yelling at the other players rather than working to change the game itself.
@cristinavanko @LeylandJacob This is awesome. Thank you.
@PBraselmann90 I think this is a false narrative where people are more likely to point at the survivors rather than those who have failed.
@ItsKieranDrew Love it, Kieran. Insane opps.
@thePhilRivers Haha
@garydarna @fast For sure. I recognize that not everyone has the luxury to time it just right, but given the choice, I'd take it slow.   I hope it's going well for you!
@OscarMasiello Yep. Don't be swayed by the survivors.
@ItsBenCarpenter I love that, Benjamin.
@BuzzRobTaylor I like that, Rob.
@Brett_Trainor It often is. Reality is important.
@NickB2005 BOOM. get after it brother.
@SikiraAmer For sure, Amer.
@oledoteth For sure. At some point you need to jump in, but it's almost always smarter to do it after reaching certain milestones.
@shushant_l It's advice to be taken through whatever lens you choose.
@AdsFunnelCoach I think it's important to take small, calculated risks, which is what I try to recommend.
Please don't quit your job and go "all in".  Find an hour each day to grow a side project.  Replace 60% of your current income while trending in the right direction.  Then make your move. Almost always a better decision.
Just arrived in Chicago.  What should I do, see, eat?  (especially eat)
@natolisnuggets Willet Rye 104 for this guy.
@Zbijelic Thanks, Zlatko!
@GavinSLavelle Get after it, Gavin!
@thedankoe Thank you, my man. That means a lot coming from you.
@Nicolascole77 If you get into a good enough flow state, you can enjoy that Old Fashioned when you're done 😉
@austinbelcak Lotta people out here in massive relationship debt...
@thedankoe The smartest people often speak last.  I found this to be true in the board room as well.
@agazdecki A startup's culture is often defined in the toughest moments.
@KateBour 1. Eliminate: What should I remove? 2. Simplify: What scope can I reduce? 3. Automate: What can Zapier handle? 4. Delegate: What admin tasks can I outsource?  Whatever is left is yours.
@CheetSheets NICE!
@mathiaslindell Thank you, Mathias!
@keyurkumbhare Nice! Thanks, man.
Struggling to grow a Twitter audience?  There are 4 dead-simple plays that literally anyone can run.  Yesterday, 36,411 people got my 90-day playbook.  Miss the issue? Grab it below ↓   https://t.co/xi6yiSwQbl
@donniccolo @BunchuBets @NYCPunter @ChrisJourdan Good to see you here, Nick! Hope you're well brother. 💪
@Dmurr68 Dishoom for Indian. Delicious.
@CurtTigges If you build a business like a traditional entrepreneur, then maybe.  But if you understand how to build a bit of leverage online, you can certainly create several different revenue streams as a one-person business outside of your 9 to 5.  And
@matt_gray_ Nice work here, Matt. Love the Ikagai concept!
@austinbelcak Too much focus on the uncontrollable. Not enough on what you can actually do to stand out.
@thedankoe Or you learn that your preconceived notions are often wrong, and are open to new ways of thinking.
@heyeaslo In fact, you shouldn't hustle 24/7. You should hustle 3/4.  Bursts not burnout.
@writingtoriches Simple and magical. Nice work, Charles
@KateBour I feel like most business owners spend more time talking to mentors and other people they are generally impressed with, and not enough time talking to the people who pay their bills: customers.
@SimonHoiberg I agree!
@ItsBenCarpenter Thanks, man. About to get a massive upgrade on September 5th, too.
@nithish__1 Thank you!
@gib_hurst @eltheobald Yep. I do think so. Even if it doesn't and I only make it halfway, not bad...
@eltheobald Awesome! Congratulations :)
@blakeaburge Thank you, my friend!
@eltheobald It certainly can be the least risky option if you spend time building it out.
@Ownit_Fran Love that, Francisco!
@SahilBloom Practical and tactical. That's my motto.
@blakeaburge I keep thinking you're going to run out of Excel hacks. Feel like you've got 100 more in your pocket 😆
@omarakhaddaj So glad you had a safety net, Omara!
@ItsBenCarpenter Nailed it here, Benjamin.
@DrewKopera It's literally everything.
@Valucop True story...
@CheetSheets Exactly.
@burkr_ Of course we do. I don't expect that I'll Tweet this and get 100% compliance. Hopefully just one person will make a change. Ya know?
@thegoldsuite I mean building several different revenue streams as a one-person business.
@jameskonn 100%. That's the plan right there, James.
@TheRobbMann Because that's what I believe in based on my experience.
@afunnelguy True story, Rohan.
@jasonstrimpel Gotta start somewhere, Jason.
Every news story is about layoffs.  This is the often-ignored risk of being employed.  $75,000 salary one day. $0 the next.  This is why I champion the principles of diversified solopreneurship.  Start today and build your future safety net.
@_Hustle_Hustle @wealthduck @pluckyjones @ianwrush @benkellyone @ReiniLackner Thanks!!
@dickiebush I sure hope so, man!
@natolisnuggets I think it will be helpful, man.
@austinbelcak Wild huh? :)
@gjsequeira For sure it does, GJ.
@ashappdev Congrats!
@KateBour Marketing, like most things, isn't binary. It's not 1 or 0. It's an aggregation of many things done well.
@wes_kao Great thread, Wes, especially the one about teaching without people falling asleep.  Thanks for putting this together 🔥
@CheetSheets Thank you!
@domestic_nair @SahilBloom @ElizabethSBloom LOL
@SahilBloom @ElizabethSBloom That's a helluva strategy right there.   A new Twitter growth course from Sahil &amp; Elizabeth.
@keyurkumbhare See you tomorrow morning, Keyur.
@YongYuYY Looking fwd to sharing it, Yong.
Anyone can add 5,000+ Twitter followers in 90 days.  Here's how:  1. Maximize your profile 2. Livestream your journey 3. Double down on your best 4. Build an ecosystem  Tomorrow, I'll show 36,411 people how to run these plays effectively.  Subscribe here:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
@AlexAndBooks_ My faves: Last Bookstore in LA and Pendulo in CDMX.   Overrated: Al Ateneo Gran Splendid in BA.
@writingtoriches I’ve never learned more in my entire career than the last 3 years.
@AlexLlullTW I’ve heard good things about it.   Might have to check it out.
@KateBour Get after it and enjoy yourself!
@empowersobriety Thanks, Esther!
@jayclouse That shirt is BLUE.
@SahilBloom That's the ticket right there.
@petesena Thank you, thank you! I appreciate that.
@tom_butorac NICE!
@austinbelcak Thank you, my friend. All started with a PDF :)
@RyanJonesSEO Nice, Ryan!
@blakeaburge Exactly. And networking online is just like offline.
@SachinRamje Right back at you, Sachin!
@dickiebush Damn. 100? I lost 40 back in 2019, then found 20 of them again. 😂 Back to the treadmill...right...now...
@KurtisHanni Exactly, Kurtis.
@jappleby Appreciate you sharing it, Jack.   I feel you on the "bad eggs".  Everytime someone Quote Tweets my stuff, I brace for whatever miserably nasty thing they are adding 😂
@dklineii "Hi."
@AdsFunnelCoach Exactly.
@DanWhiteCRE This made me laugh 😂
@Zbijelic That's the ticket right there.
@KateBour Haha. I need to turn it into a PDF I can just send out.
@afunnelguy Definitely a good point, Rohan.
@sweatystartup You nailed it.   Online is just like offline. Use the same strategies and tactics to network effectively on both.  Or walk around asking everyone for help and get ignored.
@hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv.
@TnvMadhav Awesome, thanks, man!
@keyurkumbhare That's it, Keyur.

@SachinRamje @itsterryrice @thedankoe @austinbelcak It’s been 3 years since our first DM exchange, and we’ve supported each other’s growth since.  This is a really good example of building an organic relationship over time, and how you can work with peopl

@SachinRamje @itsterryrice @thedankoe An example of this in action:  One of the strongest online relationships I’ve formed over the past 3 years has been with @austinbelcak.   We first exchanged messages in July of 2019 as up-and-coming creators.   Here’s
@SachinRamje @itsterryrice Use DMs effectively to build relationships:  I don't need to reinvent the wheel here.   So, if you’re looking for an excellent primer on how to use DMs to build relationships online, read this Tweet thread from @thedankoe   http
@SachinRamje Make a meaningful introduction  Connecting 2 people who can help one another is powerful.  Solve their problem with a connection &amp; you leapfrog hundreds of other people trying to build that relationship.   @itsterryrice learned I needed h
Permissionless support:   Support someone w/o asking their permission.  You could share their content in your newsletter or create a visual of their Tweet.  That's exactly what @SachinRamje did with me, creating this beautiful visual that he shared:   https://t.co/7VK7tbkXYQ
Use a relevant, specific compliment:   Tell them something specific they’ve done that you enjoy.   If you liked a specific podcast/article, tell them why, and what impact it had on you.   Use a soft “out”:  i.e. "No need to reply, just wanted to share how it impacted me!"  https://t.co/zt0ussf4EV
Create a value-driven relationship approach:  When you reach out to someone, imagine you are one of 1,000 people doing the same thing. Yikes.  How can you differentiate yourself?  Provide value upfront with no expectation of immediate return.  Try 1 of these things weekly ↓
Your profile cheat sheet:  - Banner: Show off your brand - Headshot: Clean and polished - Bio: What are you doing &amp; what can people expect? - Pinned Tweet: Provide deeper context on your journey  Answer this: “What am I doing that's interesting enough for someone to follow me?”
Create a clear &amp; compelling profile  To build strong relationships, you need to give people a reason to be interested in you.  Start with a clear and compelling profile.   This is your "digital first impression", just like a first impression offline.   https://t.co/JEHfKz0S2Q
Here's what you'll learn in this thread:  1.  Creating a digital "first impression" 2. Using a value-driven approach 3. Combining specificity with support 4. Making relevant intros 5. Using DM's effectively 6. An example of this in action  Let's go ↓
To start, trust me when I say this:   Your online network determines your level of success on platforms like Twitter, and largely in your business.  The bigger and stronger your network is, the more likely you are to be successful in whatever endeavor you choose.
Most people suck at building relationships online.  It's always:  - Help me! - Can I pick your brain? - Will you like my Tweet?  A terrible approach.  Here's how the top accounts on Twitter build real relationships:  🧵
@realstephenlock Thanks for the shout, Stephen. Glad my content is helpful and resonating. Cheers.
Ask yourself 3 questions before you publish content:  1. Does this teach the reader something? 2. Does this challenge the reader's thinking? 3. Does this motivate the reader to make a change?  If the answer to all 3 is no, then go create something else.
@matt_gray_ Huge community man. Nice work here.
@blakeaburge Let’s get you teaching me notion tricks soon please.
@Shaynmtl Thanks, Shayn!
@nerita_ll Appreciate it Nerita!
@sahilkhosla Got the idea from watching @arvidkahl
2 weeks ago I added purchase power parity (PPP) to my website.   My mission is to make information accessible to anyone regardless of currency.   So far, I’ve enrolled 182 new students from India, Thailand, Mexico, Brazil, Vietnam, UAE, Singapore, and more.   How cool is that?
@schlaf Everyone is addicted to something, so options for help should be abundant.
@MatthewRDoan @jayclouse Great stuff, Matt!
@OladejoKayode_1 Yep.
@IAmPatyRubio Of course. There is some fact gathering and whatnot, but at some point you must get started.
@OneMike33 You'll never have the perfect idea, and even if you think you do, you won't know until you try it.
@AdsFunnelCoach 100%, Alan.
@TheChrisEgan FOMI: Fear of missing information.  The information people are missing is actually what they get when they start.
If you're thinking about starting your own business, you don't need another Twitter thread or blog post.  Just start.  You'll learn 100x more by falling on your face than by reading someone else's advice.
@HeathDingwell @jayclouse I love hearing that!
@TnvMadhav @heyeaslo Kajabi.
@thedankoe Bursts &gt; burnout
@heyeaslo I literally built a 6-figure business on Carrd landing pages. Wild.
@creation247 Whatever, whenever, whomever.
@Valucop Absolutely!
@BuzzRobTaylor Definitely important, Rob.
@SimplyTom It's a great exercise, Tom.
@TheMBA_coach Exactly.
@sahilkhosla It's certainly a lot of it, Sahil.
@seunojo_ Certainly.
@MantaisMoney Parkinson's Law at work.
@TrentAnders0n No right answer. Generally once I have enough data.
@paulcanetti Yep. Parkinson's Law. Timebox it out and get moving. You can always make it better later.
@Billionaire_CL It's a journey for sure.
@hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv!
@SahilBloom Start with the right focus and much of this falls in place.
How to build a better online business:  1) Focus: Pick the 20% of tasks that actually move the needle.  2) Timebox: Set a deadline to make progress, not be perfect.  3) Analyze: Figure out what worked, and what didn't.  4) Iterate: Implement changes based on number 3.  Repeat.

@24CARATINC They sure do.   I don't want to be crazy rich. Just satisfied and with a nice social life.
@Nathan_Boucher For sure. If you can just learn to eliminate, you're way ahead of most people.
@amorwriter Love it, John
@sweatystartup If you can do just 1 of these things, make it that one.
@IAmAnasAmrani That's right. All starts at the top.
@mejessop Thanks, Matt!
@NandinoZderic Thanks, Nandino!
@SahilBloom The biggest unlock here is just saying no in the first place. SO many people struggle with it.
@khemaridh $10k questions. I love that.
@coachgmuncy Sure thing, Gabby! Thanks for reading it.
@LeonLifeDesign Yep. I don't want to be some productivity machine, but I'd rather work 3 hours on something and make the largest impact possible.
@thedankoe For everyone. Myself included.
@blakeaburge I still need to as well!
@afunnelguy Only if they aren't meaningful to the business.
@copywithkush Thanks, Kushagra.
@KurtisHanni 100%. Most people just keep saying yes. I'm looking at myself here.
@TMitrosilis Thank you so much, Teddy. I appreciate it!
@Zbijelic Thanks for reading it, Zlatko!
That's a wrap!  I Tweet about all things audience and business growth as I work towards building my portfolio of one-person businesses to $5M in revenue.  If that's relevant to you then give me a follow here → @thejustinwelsh  Thanks for reading.
And a normal day usually looks like this:  - 7:15a: Interact on LinkedIn/Twitter for 45 minutes - 8:30a: Go to the gym with my wife, Jennifer - 11:00a: Create content &amp; eat lunch - 2:00p: Open for client calls -3:30p: Day over
So, what’s left?  There are 5 non-negotiable pieces of work that end up on my calendar:  - Interact for 45-60 minutes with my audience - Create my newsletter &amp; content - Eat lunch with my wife - Go to the gym - Client calls
If you don't have a VA, consider hiring one.   Use a service like Zirtual or find someone on Fiverr or Upwork.  “Can this be delegated?”  Yes: Delegate effectively with a process document + video. No: This is work left to be done by me
4. What can I delegate?  Release control of work that is less valuable than the time it would take you to do it.  I delegate to my VA using process documents &amp; videos that show her exactly what to do.  Here’s a thread breaking down my entire process:   https://t.co/RY5XsPKFXt
This frees up hours of time for my consulting business each month.  One-click and the entire automation goes off smoothly.  “Can this be automated?”  Yes: Build an automation No: Continue on to question 4
3. What can I automate?  Next, I look for places to automate.  An example would be my coaching business.  My old process involved emailing, sending Stripe links, reminders, calendar times, etc.  I automated every piece of this using Kajabi, Zapier, Airtable, and Calendly.
The lesson, as usual, is that processes and systems help simplify.   Always be on the lookout to improve yours.  “Can this be simplified?”  Yes: Build out a better process No: Move to question 3
2. What can I simplify?  Once things are eliminated, I simplify.  This usually comes in the form of simpler processes, or a reduction in scope of work.  An example is a new content system I've created.   What once took me 15 hours per week, now only takes me 5-6 hours per week.
If you already have a bunch of meetings on your calendar just ask:  "Does this move me closer to my most important goals?"  No: Eliminate Yes, this is critical: Move to next question
1. What can I eliminate?  Each week, my calendar has:  - Meetings I shouldn't have booked - Podcasts I don't need to be on - Favors for friends of friends  Eliminate these &amp; learn to say no moving forward.   Not good at saying no? Use this template:   https://t.co/VycAtgo2e9
Most businesses I advise spend an exorbitant amount of time working on things that don't matter.  They are not productive.  But productivity is the outcome of intrinsic motivation + systems.   And those systems drive repeatable behavior.  Here's my 4-question system:
4 questions to save you 40+ hours of meaningless work:  🧵
@Nicolascole77 Epic day.
@thedankoe Pick one. Figure it out. Maximize it, then automate it.  Then?  Pick another.
@SahilBloom The worst 😂
@Schmittastic 💪
@theMetaFi For sure. But trending. Silly.
@webhmn Could be.
@SimplyTom Not gonna happen.
@bruno_nwogu Of course. But the article lives up to the headline.
@shushant_l It's silliness.
@lfreiredev The purest.
@IAmZachHackett Haha.
@drernestomd I also thought that. Hilarious.
I can't imagine having skills, an internet connection, 4.6B potential customers, &amp; listening to nonsense like this.  https://t.co/5QDMjA8JGh
@jayclouse Thanks for having me, Jay. Looking fwd to checking out the finished product!
@GeorgeSiosi @mikekarnj @marshal @nicholaspardon @girdley @jwmares Thanks, George.   Hey Michael 👋 We met a long time ago at Skillshare.   Hope you’re well.
@dickiebush I'm good at all of these except I love a nice Hazy IPA. Almost there!
@Nicolascole77 Number 4 is how I write everthing. For one person.  Because if you can help one person, you can generally help 1,000.
@aaditsh That's the best way. Keep this focus and everything else generally falls into place.  Customer first.
@imThomasMorales For sure, Thomas.
@The_GreatBonnie Awesome!
@HoyereStrategy @ms_aegas This 👆🏻
@Jeffrey_Funk Thanks, Jeff.  Combine obsession with something people will pay for, and you're off to the races.
@jessicajychan Thanks, Jessica.
@sean_specie I'm so glad, Sean.
@melindamgolden That 2nd part is key.
@ms_aegas You sure can, but the work is much more enjoyable.  Burning out doing something you hate is the worst.
@natolisnuggets For sure, Anthony.
@RichFromPassion The Niche of One
What's the point of working for yourself if it isn't enjoyable?  That's why you shouldn't "choose a niche".   Instead, embrace an obsession.  Here's how:   https://t.co/U3KyElDKvi
@BrianFeroldi Love these visualizations, Brian.   In a world of get rich quick, stay long term investing and win out.
@CSMikeCardona @AnthonyCastrio @AlexHormozi Shit. Thanks, man.
@iam_mattharris @liamsandford Thanks, Matt.  Liam - I've amassed about 250k followers and run several successful revenue streams on LinkedIn.   Check out my website for tons of relevant content:  https://t.co/64c9cl975Z   Hope that's helpful.
@gregisenberg “When someone treats you like an option, help them narrow their choices by removing yourself from the equation. It's that simple"  This is one of the best sentences I’ve read related to this in a long time.
@KateBour @amandanat @Dmurr68 @mrsharma @GrowthTactics @harrydry @LouisSlices @TheDecision_Lab @arihappywick Thank you!

@dvassallo Build a career on things that you're intrinsically motivated by.  That means significantly less slogging away and "caffeine" motivation.
@TheRobbMann @thedankoe Factfulness is fabulous.
@austinbelcak Every time I say yes to a 30-minute "brain pick", I'm choosing a stranger over my wife.
@thedankoe And take multiple, small risks.  Can't make a fortune with zero risk.
@AlexAndBooks_ The Minimalist Entrepreneur by @shl
@heyeaslo Very little downside.  Immense upside.
@thedankoe They are all excellent.   My favorites are Factfulness and Atomic Habits.
@sourav_sinha @SahilBloom Same!

@TheDannyNaz You too, my man!
@NateAnglin It was so instrumental in improving my outlook.

@TheSamuraiMind @shl It's a great book.
@blakeaburge @warikoo Factfulness, while not a business book, was fascinating to me.
@omarakhaddaj It's definitely interesting.
@MantaisMoney @Psy_of_Money Yep. It's my favorite finance read of all time.
@NateAnglin I recommend all of these, especially Factfulness.

@BrianFOConnor Good stuff, Brian. Thanks for the shout out!
@blakeaburge You're becoming THE go-to guy for Excel stuff. Love this little corner of the internet for you. 💪
@austinbelcak Key word here is "giving".   Don't wait for people to give you anything.   Go create noise and attract attention. That attention will turn into opportunities that you created.  That's a great feeling.
@dickiebush Same. Writing daily has unlocked an entirely new life for me.  400,000+ followers, wild opportunities, 5 different revenue streams, meeting incredibly interesting people.  It's one simple thing I refuse to stop doing.
@Nicolascole77 This is my jam. You know that!
@thedankoe A masterclass in one tweet. Nice work here, Dan.
@gregisenberg 4 hours per day of high-quality, focused work will always yield more than slogging through meaningless busy work.

How to turn 1 idea into 7 Tweets:  Start with a pillar piece of content like a newsletter or podcast.  Then, turn it into:  - A story - A listicle - A teardown - An observation - Past vs. present - Contrarian take - A Twitter thread  That's it.  1 idea, 7 Tweets.

Nearly everyone is winging it:  Are some people light-years ahead when it comes to their thing? Of course.   Elon, Steve Jobs, etc.  But most people who you admire are still figuring it out.  Every day, just plugging along. As nervous as you are.  Find comfort in that.
Consistency trumps all traits:  There are lots of skills you can learn.  But as a pure trait? Consistency is tough to beat.  Athlete, businessperson, creator, etc.  Do your thing every single day and reap the rewards downstream.
You can't say yes to everyone:  I've learned that saying yes to everyone means saying no to yourself and the people you care the most about.  A 15-minute brain pick with a stranger or 15-minutes more with your spouse?  It should be that easy of a choice.
Money is not the root of all evil:  Money is simply the key to unlocking whomever you are as a person.  Get your hands on some money so you can be the best version of yourself.   Help other good people get theirs too.  Bad people with money are what's evil.
Time is the single greatest asset:  It's a cliche for a reason.  Of all of the things I wish for, having more time is number one by a long shot.  My 20s moved fast, my 30s moved so much faster.  I wish I would have appreciated time at a much younger age.
Divorce from anyone who drains you:  As I mentioned before, your environment is critical to success.  People either add to your energy or subtract from it.  You'll spend 10x more time dealing with the subtractors.  Cut early.
You won't do anything special without a little risk:  Those at the top of their fields nearly always took some risk.  - Risky idea. - Risky execution. - Risky go-to-market. - Risky advertising plan.  Don't be catastrophically foolish.  But do take some chances.
Don't spend time with people who don't reciprocate:  My therapist put it best when she told me this:  "Reciprocity is an indicator that someone is invested in the relationship."  Thanks, Erin.
If you can't teach yourself, you're a liability:  If people have to spend their time teaching you simple things that you can learn on the internet, you'll always be considered a liability.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living.  Being auto-didactic is a differentiator.
10% of people will hate what you do no matter what:  I've seen it in every industry and with every creator.  There is a group of people that will always dislike you and your mission. No matter what.  Focus on the 90%.  Not the 10%.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with being selfish:  Can you be selfish to a fault? Of course.  If you always put the needs of others over yours (and your families), life will be more difficult.  Give and take.  Or get taken advantage of.
Everyone has knowledge that other people will pay for:  The idea that you have to be an "expert" or have a certificate to teach or sell something is a fallacy.  Expertise is linear.   You can make a living helping those 2-3 steps earlier in the journey than you.
Getting 1% better at something means leaping millions:  1% of the total internet-connected population is 46M people.  Continue to get 1% better each month, quarter, or year, and you're making significant strides in the overall ecosystem.
Throw your 10-year plan in the trash:  When I look at the people in my network who are on top, most have embraced pivots, chance, and randomness.  They had a plan. They had milestones.  They changed them when data (and qualitative feedback) suggested doing so.
The most important skill to learn is how to learn on your own:  Mentors are great, but they are overrated.  Mentors work well when you've reached a ceiling of teaching yourself everything you could possibly know about a subject.  Learn to learn and you're unstoppable.
It's difficult to build a work ethic without the right environment:  Everyone talks about "hard work" and "outworking the competition".  It's tough to forcefully create this behavior.  Curate your environment and the behavior is a more likely outcome.
Comparing yourself to others is the easiest way to get distracted:  You can only control how successful you are, not how successful someone else is.  Be the best version of yourself, not a better version of someone else.
99% of people are out for themselves, even if it doesn't appear so:  Most people might find this pessimistic, but I just find it realistic.  Curious about someone's motivation?   Look at how they are incentivized.
The 2nd biggest difference between success &amp; failure is persistence:  Successful friends &amp; peers of mine have almost always been doing their "thing" for decades.  Not years.  Most people give up in the "I suck at this" phase without considering the journey from a 30k ft view.
The biggest difference between success &amp; failure is getting started:  The majority of people I know fantasize about things that actually can be accomplished.  They just never get started.  If you get started and play the long game, you have a great chance of winning.
Things I know at 41, I wish I had known at 21.   🧵

@RBouschery I love keg stands.
@paulcanetti Ha. Good call.
@keyurkumbhare Yes sir.
@SterlingKurtz For sure.
@luqmanshantal Yep. Ecosystem means everything.
@TheAmineAouragh Yup.
@rachanashinde_ Nice, Rachana!
@itsjustpiyush Only if that's who you choose to follow.
Twitter is like college but with relevant professors.
@Nibsio It's one of my favorite reads ever. I have it bookmarked to revisit it monthly.
I say no to 90% of what comes my way.  Prioritizing our time is the best decision for ourselves and our families.  Get yourself right. Get your family right. Get your friends right.  Then you're in a better position to help others.
@Nicolascole77 Building out S30for30. Show us the secret sauce!
@thedankoe If you take a complex topic and simplify it, you can keep a reader's (or listener's) attention for hours.
@alexgarcia_atx Smart move :)
@agazdecki The more I remain optimistic in the face of doom and gloom, the less it tends to impact me.
@heyeaslo Context switching is solopreneur kryptonite.
@LoftedLearning Oooh. Like that.
@Nibsio For sure. That's a great point!
@Schmittastic Wow. I love that, Amy.  This came right from my therapist and it was really eye opening.
@IAmZachHackett Most of us need to start by avoiding, and once we've avoided, it's about pursuit. Interesting huh?  Note: Stole this from my therapist.
@omarakhaddaj True!
@hey_dhruv Exactly, Dhruv.
@darentsmith It's a good point, Daren.
@blairmacgregor The latter. I've conquered my former self and now I need a new target to shoot for.
There are 2 phases in our growth:  1. Push: when we're trying to be better than who we once were.  Usually manifests as "I don't want to be X"  2. Pull: when we've done that, &amp; now need new motivation.  Usually manifests as "I want to be X"  Important to understand where you are.
@dvassallo Congrats, Daniel!   Aside from making great money, you also inspired people like me to throw my hat in the ring.  I'm grateful that you did.
@sliauzys I spent about 45 minutes writing a newsletter, which became this Tweet thread, which also became 17 pieces of other content.
@davidmiracle_ Thank you, David!
@DefilippiCharly 7k and some change.
@itsjustbri_yt  https://t.co/v3EarXoSHk
@ecomchasedimond Damn, this is a great thread. Saved to review 🙌
@DanKulkov What do you mean exactly?
@enriqueaquiles_ Slack is just to notify you?
@CSMikeCardona Damn. That’s pro level right there
@YogiRavi Very cool. Love it.
Solopreneurs:  What’s the most helpful Zapier automation you’ve built?
@josiahfitness Appreciate that!!
@SikiraAmer Thank you so much!
@Agrauro @HarrisFanaroff A very meta and ironic comment, no?
@TMitrosilis Thanks, man!
@jtron9k For sure!
@shushant_l Certainly.
@The_GreatBonnie It's great for organic growth.
@HarrisFanaroff Yep. Stories, for the most part.
@storymentor Thank you so much, man!

@aaditsh Thank you so much, Aadit. Right back at you.
@dickiebush Thank you, my man. Just trying to catch you!
@Nicolascole77 Exercise your brain and your body daily.
@dickiebush Build that habit muscle.  Once you do, digital writing becomes easier and much less scary.
@thedankoe Couple this with understanding other people's perspectives and you're on your way to a better mind.
@gregisenberg If you get the experience for the members right, everything else becomes so much easier.
@agazdecki The timing to go all-in on yourself will never be 100% exactly perfect. That's why now is the best time.
@SeanPHogue Ain't that the truth, Sean.
@KateBour @AlexAndBooks_ @Dmurr68 @amandanat @arihappywick @p_agnew Thank you, Katelyn!
@asearchforvalue Haha. Thanks.
@SergioRocks That's awesome, man!
@SachinRamje Thank you so much, my man. Appreciate you.
@dcwhatwhat For the first 90 days, yes.
@thegoldsuite For sure. Systems are my backbone.
@AlexAndBooks_ Appreciate you, man. Looking fwd to connecting!
@IAmZachHackett Sure thing, Zach!
@ManjhunathRavi Thanks, Manjhunath!
@blakeaburge You too, man. Your growth is wild.
@sahilkhosla How often are you writing threads?
@thedankoe For sure. That's how I met you. Get social out there...
@imrane_dessai Keep going, Imrane!
@sahiljamkhedkr_ Thanks, Sahil!
@FlorianMielke I don't really use them that frequently. I use @blackmagic_so to respond to my favorite people.
@colby_ch 45 minutes in the morning normally.  Then maybe 15 minutes later today.  That's about it.
@gregisenberg Anyone, anywhere, anytime.  I have 1,000+ pieces of content working on my behalf in the universe at all times.  Pretty wild.
@jappleby @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @heykahn @aaditsh @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup @hypefury @TwemexApp @typeshare_co @TwitterBlue I use Typeshare for Thread and Newsletter templates but end up posting them through Hypefury
@matt_gray_ For sure. It's social media...might as well treat it as such.
@CheetSheets Thanks!
@YongYuYY You're welcome. Thanks for reading it!
@Nicolascole77 Appreciate you, brother. Thanks for building Typeshare :)
@jappleby @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @heykahn @aaditsh @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup @hypefury @TwemexApp @typeshare_co @TwitterBlue I'm not super familiar with Chirr. Worth a look?
@KurtisHanni For sure, Kurtis.
@rychieverse Yep. Learn one first, then add on.
@dklineii That's right, man. Consistency trumps most.
@sweatystartup Same, Nick. Pretty wild.
@SahilBloom Thanks, man. Gotta build the habit muscle first.
@SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @heykahn @aaditsh @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup @hypefury @TwemexApp @typeshare_co @TwitterBlue That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the

A step-by-step thread once weekly:  Weekly threads power my growth.  I gained thousands of followers by sharing detailed threads.  My goal is to walk someone step-by-step through something critical in solopreneurship.   https://t.co/ajS4ODrlb7
An educational tweet each PM:  Each afternoon, I share a lesson from my solopreneur journey.  Topics include:  - Audience growth - Service businesses - Building info products - Using social media effectively  I pretend I'm writing to help ONE person.   https://t.co/zRuGfCGl3p
Built my publishing habit each AM:  In October, I committed to publishing daily on Twitter.  I started with a "Happy {Day} to X" Tweet each morning.  I had 2 goals:  1. Build a habit of posting each day. 2. Put my name &amp; face in front of people daily.   https://t.co/uqiitqmrPr
A growing Twitter audience is an asset to any entrepreneur.  I've added 120,476 followers in just 8 months.  Here are the 7 dead-simple things I did:
@Chadmgreenlee Thanks for the 2x Welsh shout, Chad!
@SimplyTom Haha. Are you sure John Collins just doesn't call me "Bill"?   (just kidding - thanks for pointing this out, man)
@gregisenberg Great thread. LinkedIn is crazy powerful right now and not just for b2b. b2c too!
@thegoldsuite Oh, for sure!
@theficouple I love that.
@amorwriter Awesome :)
@MerrylDmello Not a bad plan, Merryl.
@IAMIDarlington It sure can! I've had that happen.
@joshdviner It's a great feeling.
@lexpaval It's fun to finally remove them.
@TheAmineAouragh Not quite, but almost!
@Ayaaaansk That's what I'm working toward.
@keyurkumbhare You got this.
@davidfuesser Yep. My goals!
@Hunckler Ha. Ain't it though?
My business plan for the 2nd half of 2022 is to avoid things I don't like doing.
@AlexAndBooks_ Inn-N-Out homie.
@thedankoe This is my entire mantra.
@thedankoe Be the calm voice of reason in an otherwise crazy world conversation.
@AlexAndBooks_ Eat burgers to make the mind happy and then exercise to eat more burgers.
@aaditsh Nice! As someone who recently stood up a LinkedIn business page, you got me, Aadit.
@writingtoriches Nailed it. This is so spot on.
@sweatystartup Daniel Wellington is great. Clean, sophisticated, affordable.
@OnlyLearnOnce Crazy, Tom.
@KurtisHanni Same, man.
@pbasilstrength Ain't that the truth, Pat.
@dennishegstad Happy 4th, Dennis!
@heyflus Agree.
@thegoldsuite For sure.
@priyankaiitk Awesome. Keep going!
@ManjhunathRavi I think that could be true.
@jasonstrimpel For sure. Like anything, a little practice works wonders.
@mrdanielamadi So true, Daniel.
@blairmacgregor You too, Blair. Make it a good one!
@gregisenberg Amen, Greg. Have a great 4th, man.
@artkulak Amazing, Art.
@simpleisprofit Keep it going, man!
@Maryam_Dollar For sure, Maryam.
@eitan_levy101 For sure. It's why I post and run away.
@blakeaburge Isn't that wild? Same thing happened to me in 2019.
@CheetSheets Absolutely!
@hey_dhruv Love this, Dhruv.
@shushant_l Nice, Shushant.
@theficouple Wild. I love it!
@copywithkush Thank you, Kushagra.
@copyforcreators That's 100% correct.
@georgetaffs It's just what I'm familiar with, so I stick with it.
@luqmanshantal Thank you, Luqman!
@LuisDuquePE Awesome. So glad to hear it, man.
@ChaseAHappyLife Appreciate it, Chase.
@writingtoriches Thank you, Charles!
@thedankoe What am I likely to learn if I follow this person?
@AlexAndBooks_ Because a lot of books I've read should just be Tweets 😆
@aaditsh Wonderful thread, Aadit.  Audience building is more than great content.  It's an aggregation of intentional plays that build trust and deepen relationships.  Well done.
@heyeaslo You don't even need a laptop at all to make money online.   Ain't that crazy?
@thedankoe Thank you, Dan. Means a lot coming from you, man. Appreciate it.
@SahilBloom Thank you, man. Much appreciated!
@ankitvekaria Love it, Ankit!
@TMitrosilis I have to or else I get all over the map!

@readershubham @AlexAndBooks_ Thank you!
@KateBour That's probably a better way to say it :)
@AlexandraAllen_ Thank you so much for sharing it, Alexandra!
@NotionYoule Thank you!
@ms_aegas Ha. I DID write this on LinkedIn in November of 2021, just to be clear.  https://t.co/1gCimdjISy
Life gets easier once you realize the entrepreneurs you admire are just like you.  A more consistent, curious, &amp; less risk-averse version of you.  So, if you want to join them, you only have 2 options:  A: Get started. B: Don't.  Option A is scary, but option B is scarier.
@mauriciosampaio Basically.
@SachinRamje For sure it is, Sachin.
@TaniaDiscovered That's awesome. I love making people happy!
@yoursilverlight @thedavelyman Crypto (of course)
@thedavelyman Thanks. There are about 10 of them now, so I've stopped trying.
@CopySpell It sure is.
@3PillarsParent Lol
@sahilkhosla You too, my man.
@artkulak That's exactly what the best marketers are doing today, Art.
@henwalkco I love that, Henry.
@Ayiyi_Daniel01 It certainly does.
@yoursilverlight Try Building a Storybrand to start.
Happy Saturday to entrepreneurs who realize psychology is just as important as marketing.
@blakeaburge I need a Zapier thread with your favorites.
@Natalie_Furn @arvidkahl @NotechAna @NigelGodfrey @u15yale @JelmerPe @nocodelife @bentossell @agazdecki @alexwestco @ThatChristinaG @chiefmartec Nice work! Keep going :)
@SachinRamje Congrats on the launch! Looks awesome man.
@AlexAndBooks_ @dickiebush @AlexHormozi @Codie_Sanchez @alexgarcia_atx @wes_kao Thank you, my man! I appreciate being amongst these folks.
@austinbelcak Instead of answering generic questions, show the company that you know how to solve problems that are relevant to the business.
@thedankoe People tend to project their own insecurities as facts.
@agazdecki  https://t.co/IMkKCVUW6K
@heyeaslo Must haves:   - Skills - Payments page  That's it.
@sweatystartup There is no faster way to grow as a person, or inside of a business, than by being solutions-oriented.
@litwin_sonia Awesome. See you tomorrow, Sonia!
@thedankoe Thank you, Dan!
@gregisenberg Appreciate that, Greg.
@dennishegstad 💪💪
@freelanceninja1 Thank you, Mubeen.
@NotionYoule Absolutely, Youle.
@DeskboundT It's the #1 thing I do. Eliminate or just say no in the first place.
@csasarman98 Nailed it, Constantin.
@blairmacgregor Thanks, Blair! Looking fwd to sending it.
@CheetSheets Definitely a good Matrix. I think it's a bit high-level and misses automation and simplification.
@artkulak Lots of people set goals and then work on things that don't actually help you reach them.
@SimplyTom Thanks so much, Tom. Been fun.
@SahilBloom Thank you!
