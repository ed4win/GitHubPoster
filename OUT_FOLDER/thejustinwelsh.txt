1620924793192124416 2023-02-01 23:19:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush My favorite prompt is this:  Start by feeding it something you've written and ask it to analyze using NLP for tone, voice, and style.  Then, ask it to write something, and be very specific, while telling it the tone, voice, and style.  Pretty interesting.
1620870145269985280 2023-02-01 19:42:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamfra5er @hypefury @TwemexApp @typeshare_co @blackmagic_so @tryshotsnapp @followerwonk @birdy_so Hear amazing things. Need to add that.
1620870071781588992 2023-02-01 19:41:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coppensstom @hypefury @TwemexApp @typeshare_co @blackmagic_so @tryshotsnapp @followerwonk @birdy_so Heard great things about it.
1620865896829931520 2023-02-01 19:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6 tools every Twitter creator should know about:  1. @hypefury: Publishing + growth 2. @TwemexApp: User's best Tweets 3. @typeshare_co: Content templates 4. @blackmagic_so: Rapid engagement 5. @tryshotsnapp: Beautiful iPhone mocks 6. @followerwonk: Net followers + best times
1620831832660148225 2023-02-01 17:09:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamfra5er Not all of them, no. Some have been friends forever and I'm determined not to discard them.
1620831508000026631 2023-02-01 17:08:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pgthethird I love that, Peter.
1620831341230325761 2023-02-01 17:07:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NHammondDesign Yeah - I had a lot of negative quote Tweets in the beginning. Over time, those people fade away because they exhaust even themselves.
1620830885888278533 2023-02-01 17:06:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyJordanRistow So many!
1620830803495374849 2023-02-01 17:05:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DilaniaDigital Great change!
1620830747090391040 2023-02-01 17:05:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AnthonyLatona Smart moves, Anthony.
1620830669382500352 2023-02-01 17:05:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup True story.
1620823093710131215 2023-02-01 16:35:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Some people's entire identity is "everything is terrible and unfair."  That must be so exhausting.
1620799101855236096 2023-02-01 14:59:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ZssBecker I remind myself daily.
1620789760464719872 2023-02-01 14:22:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse You have to look at it this way because creator revenue isn't linear. YoY is a great way to see the improvement.
1620789639953915910 2023-02-01 14:22:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I great example of this is Andrew Gazdecki over at Acquire.
1620789524249935873 2023-02-01 14:21:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Business is one vehicle for life transformation. It pays to understand that.
1620789219022049283 2023-02-01 14:20:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Not just problem solving, but opportunity creation. My best ideas come during this time.
1620789083600478209 2023-02-01 14:20:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom People like that are absolutely exhausting. It's cyclical, too. Hate everyone - have less success - hate everyone even more - even less success.  What a shame.
1620788499376119809 2023-02-01 14:17:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @svpino This is the same message I get from people who I assume have it all figured out.  It's so great to know everyone feels this way.
1620783034827182080 2023-02-01 13:56:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge That's a good sign!
1620782836893777920 2023-02-01 13:55:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Interesting. Looking it up now. Thanks, Teddy!
1620779490908733441 2023-02-01 13:41:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder This is the lesson I've learned over time.  Still fall victim to the former though.
1620778927991173124 2023-02-01 13:39:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lunatic_sain Sure. For example, I love talking about intentional lifestyle design. But I mess this up all the time. Some days, my life gets out of control and I think, "Should I be allowed to be talking about this?"   But then I remember that nobody is perfect.
1620778611577085952 2023-02-01 13:38:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CharlotCrowther @evielync @dickiebush Just use @testimonialto by @damengchen
1620778105643372544 2023-02-01 13:36:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Same.  I still have to remind myself of this literally every day.
1620776142675517440 2023-02-01 13:28:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Appreciate you, Bryan.
1620775414355628033 2023-02-01 13:25:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Reid_HFC Exactly.
1620775346332385280 2023-02-01 13:25:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @V2Christina I read your mind because it's my mind :)
1620775290602659841 2023-02-01 13:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer It hasn't - that's the interesting part.  If anything, it gets a bit worse. I wake up every day wondering if I'm still relevant or canceled or whatnot.  I don't think a lot of people talk about it because their ego gets in the way.
1620774447706955778 2023-02-01 13:21:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bishant_baniya @drewrcarr @writes_eve @ItsKieranDrew @GrammarHippy Thanks, Bishant!
1620774332686553088 2023-02-01 13:21:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejoshuageelen That's a really good way to capture what I was trying to say. Thanks, Joshua.
1620773849527898112 2023-02-01 13:19:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachary_ashburn Same.
1620773836135464972 2023-02-01 13:19:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JonMThurlow I agree, Jon. Felt it forever (and still do).
1620773764085727232 2023-02-01 13:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamgregjackson Ha. True.
1620773725321969669 2023-02-01 13:19:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sean_deloughery I feel that, Sean.
1620773096734035968 2023-02-01 13:16:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every Solopreneur I know faces similar struggles:  Fears of irrelevancy, feeling fraudulent, impostor syndrome, wondering if they are "good enough", chasing other people's success, yo-yo'ing confidence, etc.  In a weird twist, this is what keeps them driving forward, too.
1620607692594352128 2023-02-01 02:19:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BHeathMarketing There’s no funnel. I talk about the topic a lot. People find my website. They purchase. I also invest a bit in SEO but hardly at all. That’s it.
1620545310056660993 2023-01-31 22:11:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfcarlson For example, I follow @dvassallo and interact with his content.  But I never see it on my "For You" timeline.   This means that many of my followers aren't seeing my content, which has led to a 43% reduction in impressions.
1620543083648811011 2023-01-31 22:02:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DominikBetner @raymeaguirre I don't actually know. It's probably an unfounded fear.
1620542240581111809 2023-01-31 21:59:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realAaronErnst I appreciate that, Aaron.
1620539661843333120 2023-01-31 21:48:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KylerStocks_ @thedankoe 1. Study the biggest names. 2. Write the way you talk. 3. Don't stop.
1620538827650760706 2023-01-31 21:45:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @raymeaguirre Haha. Thanks. I prpobably should, but I hate the thought of annoying my subscribers.
1620538038156955652 2023-01-31 21:42:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert I follow very little writing advice from Twitter.
1620537835228135424 2023-01-31 21:41:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joe_lurie @thedankoe Thanks, Joe!
1620537659625205760 2023-01-31 21:41:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MeetMattL Nope. None. Forgot that.
1620537597562064896 2023-01-31 21:40:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvanThomson01 Thanks, Evan!
1620537554994089985 2023-01-31 21:40:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjohnjamison Thanks, John.  I hope more people approach this non-traditionally.
1620537408508022786 2023-01-31 21:40:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSam10x But everything that peopel say not to do seems to work. Maybe best practices need an update?
1620537300215275520 2023-01-31 21:39:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessedanyusufco I appreciate that, Jesse.
1620536819128635392 2023-01-31 21:37:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I follow almost zero best practices for selling information products:  - Low-cost - Zero editing - Very short length - No email marketing  And I still haven't found someone doing more revenue at higher margins.  Remember to always challenge what's "best".
1620501573544857602 2023-01-31 19:17:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @InTheMoneyAdam @BrianFeroldi The point is that the default view is showing my 311,000 followers much less of my content - so my engagement is down 60%.  When I choose to "Follow" someone, I'm basically saying, "I want this person's content" so why wouldn't that be featured in the "For Me"?
1620500228511268866 2023-01-31 19:12:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamSinger I didn't really, I just have an auto-plug that goes out once a Tweet reaches a certain number of likes.  But, definitely always be closing :)

1620458426504712192 2023-01-31 16:26:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tclarkmedia Yes. Happened to me and I was very confused.
1620448940532563970 2023-01-31 15:48:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Yeah I’m not a shitposter so I can’t hack it in that environment. 📉
1620447508051951619 2023-01-31 15:42:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp @SamanthaPostman Show up daily for years and get repaid that way. Wild.
1620445759182352384 2023-01-31 15:35:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SteveOnSpeed That’s good! I’m hoping it’s just a temporary thing but who knows. Just feels very different suddenly.
1620442060313755649 2023-01-31 15:21:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamanthaPostman Down 60%
1620441687196848128 2023-01-31 15:19:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SportsBoyTony Miss you buddy.
1620441676933378050 2023-01-31 15:19:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday For sure. Weird moves.
1620441553172070400 2023-01-31 15:19:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikestottwp Both.
1620441355200892928 2023-01-31 15:18:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkShust @petergyang Agreed. I want to see people I choose to follow.
1620441195502776321 2023-01-31 15:17:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamierusso Haha. Same.
1620441150292398083 2023-01-31 15:17:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hitimobas  https://t.co/DBj7uFFcm6
1620440684263251968 2023-01-31 15:15:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby It’s pretty lame.
1620440562120671238 2023-01-31 15:15:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter feels really dead right now.  I'm being shown less of what I care about, and more of what I don't care about.  Creators I love following have disappeared from my timeline.  Trending is all about vaccines and politics.  Anyone else feeling this?
1620419402515759109 2023-01-31 13:51:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew When we create things for ourselves, not only is it easier, but the results we were looking for start magically appearing.
1620419292721455109 2023-01-31 13:50:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder I'm not sure I can get behind that in Upstate NY in February :)
1620419181354299395 2023-01-31 13:50:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe I think what you're describing with the latter might be "joy".   Happiness is fleeting. Joy is a steady state that comes from having a purpose that you're working towards.  Good stuff here, Dan.
1620418908649041920 2023-01-31 13:49:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I have about 5 friends that will be there through ups and downs.   It's about being around when it's the lowest of the low.
1620418513126191107 2023-01-31 13:47:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Love that - congrats man! Keep going :)
1620415928700919813 2023-01-31 13:37:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Hanseflats This is awesome, Hans! Great work, man. Thanks for creating it.
1620415423576694785 2023-01-31 13:35:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It absolutely does. Especially how you think.
1620415363975626752 2023-01-31 13:35:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Thanks, Alex!
1620415331406856193 2023-01-31 13:34:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday 100%. That's why I recommend people work on just getting that first $1.
1620413476266184705 2023-01-31 13:27:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkWi11is A video course on how to build a LinkedIn audience.
1620413360507613186 2023-01-31 13:27:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer I don't remember, to be honest. Probably a bottle of wine.
1620413158027587584 2023-01-31 13:26:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcharlesburch Not there yet (but almost)
1620411757461393409 2023-01-31 13:20:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @prolificholas It feels magic even to this day.
1620411695624761350 2023-01-31 13:20:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WitAndWellbeing Sold a video course for $50 on how to build your LinkedIn audience.
1620411625613455360 2023-01-31 13:20:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shrawanrajkc Selling a digital video.
1620411566800900098 2023-01-31 13:19:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JayMacBiz That's why making your first $1 is so important.
1620410786119131136 2023-01-31 13:16:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The very first time I made $50 on the internet in 2019, I knew working for someone else was a choice, not a requirement.
1620176671885373443 2023-01-30 21:46:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheNoahHein @CahlDee I heard it from someone else (who likely also heard it from someone else)
1620108532359237632 2023-01-30 17:15:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The only hard work some people will do is look for a shortcut.
1620098337117446146 2023-01-30 16:35:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You don't need a flashy new idea to build a business.  Go find:  - Antiquated industries - Slow companies - Poor service  Use technology to do a better job and you'll likely start chipping away.  A much easier lens to view entrepreneurship through.
1620068770881363968 2023-01-30 14:37:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Ain't that the truth.
1620052979238961153 2023-01-30 13:35:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks The complete AHA moment.
1620052942010335232 2023-01-30 13:34:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyKMedia Wow. Love that :)
1620052917800800260 2023-01-30 13:34:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Nice! Keep going, Leo.
1620051575577399296 2023-01-30 13:29:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LifeWthCat This is awesome, Cat! Congrats.
1620051451396620288 2023-01-30 13:28:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSoleJasper This is the truth.
1620051383398596608 2023-01-30 13:28:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegoldsuite For sure. I know that's true.
1620049073826041856 2023-01-30 13:19:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LaughsAndWrites Certainly. It's when you find yourself doing it 40 years later that isn't optimal.
1620048893366112256 2023-01-30 13:18:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maffeodrinks That's the truth, man.
1620048760859676672 2023-01-30 13:18:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer Really good stuff, Chris. Keep writing, man!
1620048372030910465 2023-01-30 13:16:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Exactly, Marcus.
1620048325176336384 2023-01-30 13:16:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy No. I have a shelf life os about 5 years. I get too excited to try new things.
1620048268603559936 2023-01-30 13:16:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Same for me, Jay.
1620047736572727298 2023-01-30 13:14:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So many people make money &amp; support their families by doing something they don't enjoy.  Part of why I love Solopreneurship is that it helps reverse that.  There's nothing better than waking up energized and focused on an enjoyable North star.
1620024719616655360 2023-01-30 11:42:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @karlsutt @LBacaj @CoreyWilksPsyD @arcnotes @myusuf3 @p_millerd Thanks, Karl!
1619906698562650113 2023-01-30 03:53:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliAbdaal Wow. So pleased people find value in my courses, and I appreciate you sharing them, Ali.  Surprisingly, of my 2 courses, I would honestly rank this one 2nd, but I'll take it! :)
1619815868334223360 2023-01-29 21:52:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomaldertweets @aaditsh @DenseDiscovery @nonmayorpete @MilkRoadDaily @tldrdan @notboringco @IndieHackers Thanks, Tom!
1619688379611742208 2023-01-29 13:26:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone has $100,000+ of knowledge in their brain right now.  The idea that you have to be an "expert" or have a certificate to teach or sell something is a fallacy.  Expertise is linear.   You can make a living helping those 2-3 steps earlier in the journey than you.
1619407368672124928 2023-01-28 18:49:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh @SahilBloom @SystemSunday @DruRly @JamesClear Thank you, Harsh!
1619392776038416385 2023-01-28 17:51:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamdeweyrodgers What podcast? I'm not familiar with Lex.
1619337606751457285 2023-01-28 14:12:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjfinley7 This crosses my mind in some way, shape, or form, daily.   I'm unemployable, yet 100x more employable than ever.
1619334016133627904 2023-01-28 13:58:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer I don't mind the questions, but a hello would be a nice opener :)
1619331353077760001 2023-01-28 13:47:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_Noahwainwright For sure, Noah. That's exactly it.
1619330987359629314 2023-01-28 13:46:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Love that simple decision tree.
1619327759544913920 2023-01-28 13:33:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikemckeewrites Good work, Mike 💪
1619327599146328065 2023-01-28 13:32:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maffeodrinks Funny how we're more capable than we thought.
1619327464693723136 2023-01-28 13:32:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RyanHVaughn Love this, Ryan.
1619327415398068224 2023-01-28 13:31:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks True story.
1619324061791801347 2023-01-28 13:18:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Some risk is easy to see: Failing or losing part of your income.  Some risk is much harder to see: Regret or a life without purpose.  The former is why people skip entrepreneurship.  The latter is why they shouldn't.
1619121658266112001 2023-01-27 23:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @digtoolsonline Thanks, Jason!
1619101777105915906 2023-01-27 22:35:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theothermjordan I don't mind DMs at all. And I'm just being funny here, I'm not upset.  But a simple "Hello" is always helpful - ya know?
1619096138891644929 2023-01-27 22:12:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheChainograph Ultrarealistic, 8k, high face detail -- 5 iw
1619095168527003648 2023-01-27 22:09:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HBrebaugh A "Hello" might be nice.
1619094928943882249 2023-01-27 22:08:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Good question 😂
1619094854067458049 2023-01-27 22:07:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Clintism This made me laugh :)
1619094409106317313 2023-01-27 22:06:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 90% of my DMs are people treating me like ChatGPT.  https://t.co/IlMF4lsXuo
1619029044963721216 2023-01-27 17:46:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realAaronErnst This is basically being successful in anything, summarized. I love it.
1619028697918623750 2023-01-27 17:44:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy I agree
1619028261551636482 2023-01-27 17:43:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Super similar. Love that.
1619028168169639937 2023-01-27 17:42:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tatha_choko By realizing that stopping guaranteed that continued.
1619028045154877440 2023-01-27 17:42:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexxroy That's the key.
1619028030328016896 2023-01-27 17:42:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @modern_mindset Zero point in waiting.
1619027579998175232 2023-01-27 17:40:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Marketing yourself on Twitter is about taking a million shots on goal.   Good or bad, everything you publish is a data point.
1618979245719699457 2023-01-27 14:28:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Smart, man.  Systematizing your networking comes in handly. Make the plan. Run the plays.

1618797077060005888 2023-01-27 02:24:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shubhankarchau7 Use Shield App.
1618796723924799489 2023-01-27 02:23:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJackForge Awesome, Jack. Just FYI - you're one of my fave Twitter accounts that I just lurk on. 😂
1618720220344111106 2023-01-26 21:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Haha.  If you're being serious, LMK. My wife and I have long-term investing locked down pretty well.  Always down to help you.
1618717965612126209 2023-01-26 21:10:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianFeroldi Beautiful!! Keep going.
1618700662992412673 2023-01-26 20:01:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @recostseg I was literally just Tweeting about this earlier.  Making money is one thing. Keeping it is another.  Multiplying it is even different.

1618670885988339712 2023-01-26 18:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ConsumerNick My thoughts exactly.
1618670481535803392 2023-01-26 18:01:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vilibic @Antogando1 I know 2 people who have more than 1 million dollars sitting in an account earning 0% for the last 10 years because they "don't know what to do with it".
1618669892324192256 2023-01-26 17:59:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rask_ola If you think he's $20 more per month than your landscaper, then you don't know how your financial advisor makes money.
1618669595031916544 2023-01-26 17:57:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ConsumerNick Literally everything.   "I've had this million dollars just sitting in my bank earning 0% for the past 10 years. Is that bad?"
1618669435396714496 2023-01-26 17:57:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nicol3a Definitely...but...read a book...ya know?
1618647854272348161 2023-01-26 16:31:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WitAndWellbeing That's a really, really bad plan.
1618647510523973636 2023-01-26 16:30:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growinggray I know what I'm doing 😀
1618647432711278592 2023-01-26 16:29:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattbarkercopy It is. I'm surprised by how many people don't spend the time to simply learn the basics.
1618647233632833541 2023-01-26 16:29:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @1MartinMatthews My wife and I always talk about that.
1618647163726340096 2023-01-26 16:28:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realAaronErnst It is.
1618647126124433410 2023-01-26 16:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @btc_zack That's what I'm talking about. But you would think high earners would be more likely. Not judging by the conversations I have.
1618646492818046976 2023-01-26 16:26:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm shocked by the number of high-earners I know that know absolutely nothing about money or investing.  It's an absolute epidemic.
1618614521186353153 2023-01-26 14:19:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Amazing man! Congrats :)
1618606791918747648 2023-01-26 13:48:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Thank you so much, Dan. Appreciate it. You're killing it over there.
1618604568451100672 2023-01-26 13:39:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Absolutely true.
1618604475358547968 2023-01-26 13:39:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegerhardt True story.
1618604238401343492 2023-01-26 13:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DoanDemiran Talk to your boss and set expectations. That's what I did. Get support.
1618602878511493121 2023-01-26 13:32:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabe_llewellyn Welcome, Gabe!

1618602750664933376 2023-01-26 13:32:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheTomYoungs I appreciate it, Tom.
1618602689897836545 2023-01-26 13:32:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Thank you, my man.
1618601268846661638 2023-01-26 13:26:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Abraham LinkedIn.  https://t.co/2QSvNXrVKO
1618601124722020352 2023-01-26 13:25:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer Try it :) I don't have too much of an opinion.
1618601036675174400 2023-01-26 13:25:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rofimans I haven't but I could. Great idea.
1618600643006189568 2023-01-26 13:24:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DadMoneyClub I laughed way too hard at this.
1618600595484737537 2023-01-26 13:23:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshhamiltonX Thank you, Josh. I appreciate it!
1618600487133270019 2023-01-26 13:23:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justinslimm Sure thing. Most good things are uncomplicated.
1618600365347463168 2023-01-26 13:22:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse I appreciate that, Jay.
1618600318266404864 2023-01-26 13:22:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel @pyquantnews I'm so glad!
1618599753767346176 2023-01-26 13:20:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you want to take it a step further, I'd greatly appreciate if you:  1. Give me a follow here → @thejustinwelsh.  2. Retweeted the first Tweet below to your audience to share.
1618599751536058368 2023-01-26 13:20:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you liked this thread, you'll love my newsletter.  I write about how to launch, grow, and monetize internet businesses every week to 75,000+ people.  Each issue can be read in less than 4 minutes.  Join us here:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
1618599749115854848 2023-01-26 13:20:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Funnel People To Your Website:  There's a workaround for linking out on LinkedIn.  Write a good long-form piece of content, and add a link at the bottom.  Close out the "preview" image and then post.  30% reduction in impressions doesn't matter when your CTR is improved 6x.  https://t.co/tBnhkjyZeR
1618599743474614275 2023-01-26 13:20:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> LinkedIn Newsletter:  You can apply for, and get a LinkedIn newsletter easily.  When you launch your newsletter's first issue, LinkedIn will promote it to all of your followers.  That's why it's good to get 10k to 15k followers first, then launch.  https://t.co/jt5oBnSNFe
1618599737162190848 2023-01-26 13:20:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Notification Bell:  It used to be that LinkedIn didn't have a notification bell, like Twitter.  That changed a few months ago.  Now, you can set it up to receive notifications for when your favorite creators drop new content.  https://t.co/wop94hBN3T
1618599724650577921 2023-01-26 13:20:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Carousel Posts:  Last year, LinkedIn officially rolled out their carousel beta and people are taking advantage of them.  Just create a 4X5 inch Canva PDF and upload it.  Easy win.  https://t.co/UZut23SBp5
1618599715469131777 2023-01-26 13:20:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Profile URL Link:  I drive at least 100 people to my website each day via the new LinkedIn profile URL.  You simply edit your profile, scroll to the bottom and add a link.  Similar to a link in your Twitter bio, but can be edited to display as a CTA.  https://t.co/1fU6LuPpKU
1618599704161394688 2023-01-26 13:20:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Leverage Little-Known Features:  Here are a few little-known features you can use to grow:  1. Profile URL link 2. Carousel posts 3. Notification bell 4. LinkedIn Newsletter
1618599697614078127 2023-01-26 13:20:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Interact With Top Creators:  When I was getting started, I wanted to build a high-quality network.  Here's how:  1. Shared a resource 2. Engaged with their content 3. Featured them in my newsletter 4. Praised something specific they did 5. Introduced them to someone meaningful
1618599691121315840 2023-01-26 13:20:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Recycle for 2x Engagement:  After 4 years, I have over 2,000 pieces of unique content.  So, for my 2nd post (1p EST), I recycle.  I go back 365 days and update a piece of content from last year.  There are 100k+ new followers who never saw it.  And most people won't remember.
1618599683466616832 2023-01-26 13:20:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Takeaway &amp; CTC:  My goal at the end is to give the reader a nice little takeaway.   Think of it as the last thing they'll remember reading before I call them to the conversation with a simple question.  Like this:  https://t.co/Jdn8t1GG4T
1618599671538106368 2023-01-26 13:20:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Trailer:  The next part of the content I create is the "trailer."  The trailer is the opener and has 2 jobs:  - Break the scroll pattern with the first line. - Make each line intriguing enough to get the reader to the next.  Here's the trailer for that piece of content.  https://t.co/ES6DUlQ5K8
1618599659970101248 2023-01-26 13:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Meat:  The first thing I do is create "the meat" of the content.   This is where you’re teaching something.  It’s the information you want to convey.  In this example, I am teaching 10 steps that help build your first side hustle:  https://t.co/bnM8l3B1Vb
1618599653397696512 2023-01-26 13:20:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Write High-Performance Content:  High-performance LinkedIn content has 3 different parts:  - The Meat - The Trailer - The takeaway &amp; CTC  I use this to write a piece of content each morning at 8:15a EST.  Here's how it works ↓
1618599645533323264 2023-01-26 13:20:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Featured Section:  This section is a lot like a pinned Tweet but more powerful.  Use it to deplatform to a newsletter, podcast, or YouTube channel.  Have a product? Let people buy it if they are ready.   Different options for different stages of your journey.  Next up? Content.  https://t.co/YFAKDQeKhF
1618599628793942016 2023-01-26 13:19:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> About Section:  Your about section is all about social proof.  That means it's time to brag!  - What have you done in your career that makes you worth following? - What are your customers saying about your business? - What awards have you won?  Don't be shy.  Show off.  https://t.co/wGs9vS6fxu
1618599613732118530 2023-01-26 13:19:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tagline:  Your tagline is often a make-or-break moment.  The goal of the tagline is three-fold:  - Tell people who you are - Tell people what you're working on - Tell people what they should expect if they follow you  It's not time to be cute or clever.  It's time to be clear.  https://t.co/wE84LcFL0w
1618599600390115328 2023-01-26 13:19:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Headshot:  Headshots should evoke a feeling:  - Kind - Tough - Playful - Powerful - Empathetic - Professional  Your headshot should align with your brand. I sourced a specific photographer to get the headshot that evokes a feeling of confidence.  A terrific investment.  https://t.co/7l7X3DWkoq
1618599593117089792 2023-01-26 13:19:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Banner Image:  The first thing people see on your profile is your banner image.  Use it to achieve a specific outcome:  - Build brand awareness - Drive newsletter sign-ups - Send people to your website - Sell a digital product or service - Get them to follow you on social media  https://t.co/RkJTE4YwUU
1618599580609675264 2023-01-26 13:19:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Design A Profile That Converts:  Here is the journey of a prospective follower.  1) Reads your content 2) Clicks your profile 3) Sees your banner 4) Looks at your headshot 5) Reads your tagline 6) Reads your about section 7) Checks your featured section 8) Follows or doesn't  https://t.co/GkfBxCQUtb
1618599574418952192 2023-01-26 13:19:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Inside of this thread, you'll learn how to:  1. Design a profile that converts 2. Write content that matters 3.

1618599571596214272 2023-01-26 13:19:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter hates LinkedIn.  But in 2022, it accounted for $1.2M of my revenue from 175M+ impressions.  Here's how I use LinkedIn unlike anyone else:

1618359611463176192 2023-01-25 21:26:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Onejamel @BramVGenechten Thanks, fellas.

1618308093175291904 2023-01-25 18:01:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pragyanatvade And then we stay in the same tribal thinking forever.
1618308021297483776 2023-01-25 18:01:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe One of the best things you can do. 2022 was a big year for me in that way.
1618307893299937280 2023-01-25 18:00:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WitAndWellbeing Haha.
1618307768922017792 2023-01-25 18:00:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 It really is. I should journal this daily.
1618307491078746114 2023-01-25 17:59:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WStevensNiche Could you give me an example? I can think of a few people who talk poorly about me on a regular basis and neither are blocked.  But, if I've done that in the past I'd love to know to whom.
1618286385168846852 2023-01-25 16:35:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Next time you read something on Twitter that makes you angry, ask yourself this:  "Is there a chance this person could be right?"  An excellent way to keep your critical thinking skills sharp.
1618244468695773184 2023-01-25 13:48:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom There are a few folks online who claim to hate me even though we've never met, I've never interacted with them, etc.  I like to think that if we sat down and had a beer, they'd be surprised.  But then I think - Who wants to spend time with someone like that anyways?
1618243529746309121 2023-01-25 13:44:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Same. My existence on the internet is not to make everyone happy.
1618242105176100865 2023-01-25 13:39:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gera_wsl You are your first testimonial. I love that.
1618241980856950791 2023-01-25 13:38:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejoshuageelen That's the story right there, Joshua.
1618241174514585600 2023-01-25 13:35:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @monk_mode23 Start.
1618241053534081026 2023-01-25 13:35:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @junwatu Welcome.
1618241002048991234 2023-01-25 13:34:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KrisOgrabek Yep!
1618240960877727744 2023-01-25 13:34:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Yep - in fact, if you're winning everyone over, you likely don't have that interesting of a point of view.
1618240840366948352 2023-01-25 13:34:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Seems like good oddss.
1618240790421188608 2023-01-25 13:34:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue It absolutely is, Sean.
1618240741779853312 2023-01-25 13:33:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamEskow You're welcome, Adam.
1618240704081432576 2023-01-25 13:33:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomharari That's right, Tom. The more, the better.
1618237920800047107 2023-01-25 13:22:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Promote yourself online every single day:  - Your work - Your brand - Your opinions - How you think  People will either:  - Love you (customers) - Hate you (who cares) - Join you (network) - Follow you (students) - Ignore you (already are)
1618009955327692800 2023-01-24 22:16:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tibo_maker @ProductHunt WOAH. Wow.   Congrats! That's huge. 🔥📈
1617998549467402241 2023-01-24 21:31:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup I love the delegation stuff, man. As I onboard a new VA, I'll be excited to dive in.
1617924664508166145 2023-01-24 16:37:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch Not sure. I'm not very entertaining when writing, so I don't try :)   I think just do what comes naturally, but make sure it falls into one of these.
1617924500234043393 2023-01-24 16:37:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JonathanAverett @noahkagan Thanks, Jonathan!
1617924039288160260 2023-01-24 16:35:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5 types of content builds a following:  1. This person inspires me 2. This person teaches me 3. This person entertains me 4. This person makes me think 5. This person understands me  That's just about it.
1617918741328842760 2023-01-24 16:14:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nkazhin Thanks, Nikita!

1617880278793596929 2023-01-24 13:41:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @prolificholas Very, very strange. I loved this whole perspective.
1617878743447662600 2023-01-24 13:35:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AryaVahedi This is a specific blog post. It's one of his best, IMO.   https://t.co/r46H8hw7L5
1617878088398049281 2023-01-24 13:32:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RJ_Youngling I don't agree.  I've never seen a guy driving a Lamborghini and thought "that guy is so cool".   In fact, it's often the opposite.
1617877717206339585 2023-01-24 13:31:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @liamdillon This is so true, Liam.
1617877650793705486 2023-01-24 13:31:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni I've read this specific article about 100 times.
1617877615699988482 2023-01-24 13:30:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom @morganhousel He's one of my favorite writers.
1617876488224911362 2023-01-24 13:26:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theshahkunal It's true.
1617876399460868096 2023-01-24 13:26:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chenso_kendall The best way to start.
1617875756251774977 2023-01-24 13:23:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I think about this piece from Morgan Housel a lot.  To me, it reinforces that admiration comes from helping other people succeed, and not from material wealth.  If you're a Solopreneur, it's worth remembering why you're doing what you're doing.  https://t.co/SP0yZquutv
1617720501912358919 2023-01-24 03:06:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeoffTRoberts Hey Geoff - if you ever wanna chat about it, LMK.
1617627590696783872 2023-01-23 20:57:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsDanny_V Nice thread, Danny. Well written.
1617627212739645441 2023-01-23 20:55:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz You won the internet
1617627113116545026 2023-01-23 20:55:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eclecticpolymat It does. Doesn't mean people need to stop hearing it.
1617627047983190018 2023-01-23 20:55:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copystarr Or both!
1617626976315150342 2023-01-23 20:54:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Haha. Always decompress. It's great for you!
1617626831229964288 2023-01-23 20:54:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SideHustleInspo 6 to 630
1617626774258737152 2023-01-23 20:54:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsDanny_V Awesome. Great hook for this story.
1617626668587454464 2023-01-23 20:53:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Certainly one of them, right?
1617626620566831106 2023-01-23 20:53:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SWComposer Always.
1617626571124400129 2023-01-23 20:53:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dariushbarinjou We all did :)
1617626518481702912 2023-01-23 20:53:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JayMacBiz For sure.
1617604402092642305 2023-01-23 19:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to flex your Solopreneur muscle:  Stop telling people what you're going to do.  Go do it, and then tell people what happened.
1617579565614006273 2023-01-23 17:46:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marc_louvion @capacitorjs @martindonadieu Congrats, Marc!
1617578358820175880 2023-01-23 17:41:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonathanwilson Great Tweet.
1617578136593367098 2023-01-23 17:40:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NHammondDesign I thought this Tweet was relatively worthless. Turns out, other people felt differently.   https://t.co/s0q6hWNqhE
1617577945366921216 2023-01-23 17:40:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @petecallaghans I simply wonder if they are valuabel.
1617577863133134850 2023-01-23 17:39:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maxwellcopy I mean, I've published 4,000 pieces of content so I wouldn't say I'm scared.   But, because I'm human, I often hesitate.
1617577731738460169 2023-01-23 17:39:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeoffTRoberts Wow. I love that. I'll remember that.
1617577687869947920 2023-01-23 17:39:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @albadawee It's not even "edgy" per se. Just more, "is this helpful?"
1617577607582846976 2023-01-23 17:38:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Yeah, it's a good lesson and something to always keep in mind.
1617577520093593623 2023-01-23 17:38:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CaseyMMcCormick Publish everything.
1617577481862774785 2023-01-23 17:38:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess It's most just wondering about how "good" something is.
1617577414045102082 2023-01-23 17:38:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mike_heap_ That's an astute observation.
1617577344931069974 2023-01-23 17:37:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanODowd15 Just how "good" I think it is. But good is so subjective.

1617552234891599874 2023-01-23 15:58:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @petergyang Thanks Peter!
1617552020893745157 2023-01-23 15:57:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Theholisticpsyc Excellent advice all around here. Nicely done.
1617522077250060288 2023-01-23 13:58:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Good starting point.
1617522021843492869 2023-01-23 13:57:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav Over a long period of time.
1617519930009845763 2023-01-23 13:49:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyjrmoraes Pick up one book. Read it to completion. Practice like hell.
1617519715085332481 2023-01-23 13:48:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Ooh. I like that :)
1617517925019095040 2023-01-23 13:41:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcgheeriley I feel like both can be true. Justification:  I felt comfortable charging $250/hour when I started in 2018.  I wish I would have charged $800 an hour back then. But, I gained tons of clients &amp; learned how to raise my rates.  The lesson was valuable. Does that make sense at all?
1617516828678578178 2023-01-23 13:37:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge I'm terrible at plenty of them. That's why they have been lessons!
1617516755076939780 2023-01-23 13:37:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daniel_nguyenx Just do.
1617516699028459521 2023-01-23 13:36:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @inboundrevenue I can guarantee I handled many things more poorly too.
1617516611426189312 2023-01-23 13:36:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Ha. good call out.
1617516571332644866 2023-01-23 13:36:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday I appreciate that Ben :)
1617516483399254019 2023-01-23 13:35:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rfordej It's literally the easiest way to avoid most problems we face at work.
1617515706953891841 2023-01-23 13:32:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Basically :)
1617515682287218689 2023-01-23 13:32:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide It's true. So why try?
1617515612632408067 2023-01-23 13:32:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @babujiaravind I'm always adding to this list, so it's being created over many years.
1617514584406908929 2023-01-23 13:28:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheBrandonCraig Appreciate it, Brandon.
1617514561086828544 2023-01-23 13:28:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ranbirsinghlive Thanks, Ranbir!
1617514539414867970 2023-01-23 13:28:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill Yep. It's easier to be negative and right more often.  You just likely won't get very far.
1617513841331671040 2023-01-23 13:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it for today.  If you enjoyed this thread, then I'd greatly appreciate if you:  1. Give me a follow here → @thejustinwelsh. I talk about launching, growing, and monetizing internet businesses.  2. Retweet the first Tweet below to your audience to share.
1617513839054016512 2023-01-23 13:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Take every piece of advice in this thread with a grain of salt.  I'm just some random guy on the internet sharing what I've learned.  That doesn't mean it will be 100% true for you.  But, if there is one takeaway, it's this: Get started.  That's how you'll learn your lessons.
1617513837007192065 2023-01-23 13:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 44. Everyone has the same 24 hours. It's how you use it. 45. It's not helpful to study Elon and Bezos if you're making $0. 46. Quitters win a lot because they know when to give up. 47. You can't control your past. 48. You are 100% responsible for your future.
1617513834960551936 2023-01-23 13:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 39. Nobody is coming to save you. 40. Arguing online is a waste of time and energy. 41. Don't be arrogant, but have a mindset that you can do anything. 42. You never know what will resonate. Try a lot of different things. 43. Don't argue with your customers.
1617513833014116353 2023-01-23 13:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 34. Use data to create better content. 35. Never plagiarize people but borrow shamelessly. 36. Stop trying to be cool. Be successful. Cool will come. 37. You're a lot less clever than you think you are. Be clear. 38. Be on time for important things. You're not a teenager.
1617513831101497344 2023-01-23 13:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 29. Start with one revenue stream, but diversify shortly after. 30. Anyone selling instant results is a con.  31. Systems beat motivation &amp; discipline every time. 32. Quit focusing on tools and tech. Just use what you know. 33. Experiment often, but never with 2 new variables.
1617513829218361344 2023-01-23 13:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 23. Promote yourself online every day. 24. Write daily for at least 30 minutes. 25. Ignore haters. They are the least interesting people. 26. Help others and let them reciprocate. If they never do, move on. 27. Go to therapy and be honest. 28. Drink less alcohol.
1617513827066839042 2023-01-23 13:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 19. If you can make $1,000 you can probably make $100k. 20. Don't ask random people questions. Ask your customers. 21. You don't need meditation and sunlight. You need action. 22. Don't "find a mentor". Do interesting things &amp; attract mentors.
1617513824558497793 2023-01-23 13:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 14. Always over-communicate. 15. Assume you can learn something from everyone. 16. Assume everyone you talk to is also full of shit. 17. Your business heroes are regular people who took action. 18. If you can make $1, you can make $1,000.
1617513822624923649 2023-01-23 13:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10. Your network can either speed you up or slow you down. 11. Stop reading 50+ business books. Just get started. 12. Stop asking everyone, and start figuring shit out on your own. 13. If people root for you to fail, cut them out of your life.
1617513820695453696 2023-01-23 13:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6. Thick skin is a prerequisite for building in public. 7. You go 10x faster by supporting people, not tearing them down. 8. No matter how good your product is, someone will hate it. 9. Price whatever you offer at a rate you'd be comfortable paying.
1617513818682429446 2023-01-23 13:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. If you don't respect people's time, they won't respect you. 3. The best entrepreneurs know how to teach themselves. 4. You learn 100x more by trying than by reading ab someone else. 5. If you don't know how to sell, you're going to struggle.
1617513810838933510 2023-01-23 13:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every piece of advice I could think of after 4 years as a Solopreneur.  1. Pessimists are often right, and optimists are often wealthy.
1617153719602393089 2023-01-22 13:34:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Appreciate you, Dennis :)
1617151248989405184 2023-01-22 13:24:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Great addition. That's exactly how I feel.
1617151153434681344 2023-01-22 13:24:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It's like widening the pool of talent that you can learn from. Especially if you understand how to filter out the noise.
1617150776463220742 2023-01-22 13:22:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rav_pandya I love that.
1617150688965922820 2023-01-22 13:22:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Think of it as a game. Just keep playing.
1617149912021454848 2023-01-22 13:19:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theshahkunal Best way.
1617149899706875906 2023-01-22 13:19:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexandrerizos I like your Grandpa.
1617149236054790144 2023-01-22 13:16:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've been an executive at startups that raised $300M+ and generated $500M+ in revenue.  But I've never learned more than I'm learning now -  just screwing around trying to build my own thing on the internet.  Build something of your own.  A skill worth having.

1616953286136938497 2023-01-22 00:17:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @petergyang Hired.
1616796222806806530 2023-01-21 13:53:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Pre-stored templates keep me sane in Gmail. I wish HEY would add them.
1616791911204782081 2023-01-21 13:36:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew It's hard, fun, and rewarding.
1616791660079337480 2023-01-21 13:35:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni Great observation, Kurtis.
1616789946500616194 2023-01-21 13:28:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hillseeker Aint that the truth, Jeff.
1616789407805341696 2023-01-21 13:26:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Absolutely. One of the best puzzles you can figure out.
1616788145500213249 2023-01-21 13:21:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spontaneousbkpk Montreal, Lisbon, Mexico City so far...
1616788083109953541 2023-01-21 13:21:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel So many.
1616787382933626880 2023-01-21 13:18:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ProcureBites And find those people or get found.
1616786937938956290 2023-01-21 13:16:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jayyanginspires Will always be true.
1616786675123867649 2023-01-21 13:15:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Something you can do with your eyes closed is worth millions of dollars.  The catch is getting it to a small sliver of the global population that's looking for it.  It's a puzzle worth putting some time into.   Have a great weekend.
1616510517685719052 2023-01-20 18:58:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thepatwalls Epic. Super motivating, Pat.
1616475840031727616 2023-01-20 16:40:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sean_deloughery It's such a great quote.
1616475760168165376 2023-01-20 16:40:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artkulak True. And things done poorly that are well analyzed and understood.
1616474877808226305 2023-01-20 16:36:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shrawanrajkc It's one of the most difficult skills to build yet one of the most valuable.
1616474648388009984 2023-01-20 16:36:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NealOGrady That's really true.
1616474084723785731 2023-01-20 16:33:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> All massive accomplishments are simply the aggregate total of many small things done well, over a very long period of time.  A marathoners mentality.
1616452661955670020 2023-01-20 15:08:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jakobgreenfeld Or at all.
1616452531269296128 2023-01-20 15:08:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ryan___Doyle Congrats!
1616431281759191040 2023-01-20 13:43:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BorisBeceric Agreed. It will mostly be helpful to those who are already well-skilled.
1616429936960479233 2023-01-20 13:38:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nicolivesabroad It certainly provides some interesting advantages.
1616429872720519170 2023-01-20 13:38:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theMPEproject Thank you!
1616429820740571151 2023-01-20 13:37:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge It's not written by AI. Just how I use AI :)
1616429769096060936 2023-01-20 13:37:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Thank you, Ben! I appreciate that man.
1616428287756210179 2023-01-20 13:31:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom One paragraph to test.
1616428232693121025 2023-01-20 13:31:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Haha.
1616428203425284096 2023-01-20 13:31:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jefferyrobi Awesome. Thanks, Jeffrey.
1616428173511589888 2023-01-20 13:31:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomharari I think both can be useful. I love learning the nuances of it.
1616428097078697984 2023-01-20 13:31:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chenso_kendall That's a smart move.
1616428064346624001 2023-01-20 13:30:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje It's not a miracle machine as many are branding it, but it's certainly useful.
1616428001494765569 2023-01-20 13:30:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theleoalexandru For sure.

1616156503819288587 2023-01-19 19:31:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sam_starkman This is 100% accurate.

1616115243536597002 2023-01-19 16:47:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GSkrovina The best.
1616115166285905938 2023-01-19 16:47:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattchiacpa Totally, but it's easier to find the right ones by doing stuff.
1616115075495886849 2023-01-19 16:47:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chase_arbeiter Literally never a perfect day. Action takers win.
1616115017727852553 2023-01-19 16:47:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheNovaLegacy This is exactly how you should approach it.
1616114971875713025 2023-01-19 16:46:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanbaugh27 Skimmed it. I should read it.

1616072625221996544 2023-01-19 13:58:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thelucidflow Thanks, Jack!
1616072484050325508 2023-01-19 13:58:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spontaneousbkpk I think so :)
1616067970077462529 2023-01-19 13:40:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Great to put a face to the name yesterday, Danny. Hope you're well :)

1616067086270308354 2023-01-19 13:36:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Marcusluft Yep. That's awesome you did that :) Congrats.
1616067031899463680 2023-01-19 13:36:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Thanks, Ben!
1616067006624677889 2023-01-19 13:36:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom So damn easy. Of course, you'll need to upgrade tech at some point, but this is such a simple MVP.
1616064950065311744 2023-01-19 13:28:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheAbbasBlog @thedankoe Dan's a smart fella (and inspiring)
1616064074592423938 2023-01-19 13:24:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Simple and fast. As an MVP should be.
1616064026785599489 2023-01-19 13:24:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Totally. Tons of nuances.  But these are the basics.
1616063960272216064 2023-01-19 13:24:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MartinSlaney Nice!
1616063947656015874 2023-01-19 13:24:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sean_deloughery That's the whole point of this. It's probably not a great business, but who cares, ya know? Test it out :)
1616063185584267265 2023-01-19 13:21:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it for today.  If you enjoyed this thread, then I'd greatly appreciate if you:  1. Gave me a follow here → @thejustinwelsh  I talk about launching, growing, and monetizing internet businesses.  2. Retweet the first Tweet below to your audience to share.
1616063182807638020 2023-01-19 13:21:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Once you validate that there is local demand, you can collect reviews, raise prices, expand coverage, improve tech, hire more contractors, and enjoy better margins.  The sky is literally the limit.
1616063178881769474 2023-01-19 13:21:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> - Logic built into the form capture. - A custom calendar that displays contractor availability. - Post-calendar workflows to send the assignment to an open contractor. - A much more robust landing page with an about section, reviews, etc.  But for an MVP, it's not necessary.
1616063176575012868 2023-01-19 13:21:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I also could have chosen to make it much more complicated as well.  For example, I could have added:
1616063173559463936 2023-01-19 13:21:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Some Takeaways and Notes:  There are a million different ways to build an MVP, with this just being one of them.  I could have chosen to build a completely different business, pre-sold a product like a course, or delivered a paid ebook or Airtable page filled with information.
1616063170971422720 2023-01-19 13:20:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Connect the Form to Twilio using Zapier:  Lastly, I'll use Twilio to send an SMS to a contractor.  Once the form has been filled out, I used Zapier to collect the info, send it to Twilio, &amp; let Twilio send a text to the contractor.  Time: 11 minutes Cost: $0.0079 per text  https://t.co/UXlJQ3xRGP
1616063164499595265 2023-01-19 13:20:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Redirect Stripe to a Booking Form:  After payment, I can send the person to a hidden page on my Carrd website.  On this page, I’ll collect all relevant information for the contractor to show up.  Time: 5 minutes Cost: Free  https://t.co/pjj2by6urK
1616063153351151617 2023-01-19 13:20:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Connect Carrd to Stripe:  I'll need to collect payment before a dog gets walked.  You can create a product in Stripe, generate a payment link, &amp; redirect a button to the link.  Time: 3 minutes Cost: 2.9% + $.30 per transaction  https://t.co/dGuhFU7AYm
1616063142127173635 2023-01-19 13:20:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build a Landing Page on Carrd:  I'll need a place to send local traffic.  You can build a beautiful, functional, no-code page with Carrd.  I grabbed a template, uploaded a photo from Unsplash, and chose a free URL from Carrd.  Time: 8 minutes Cost: $19 per year  https://t.co/fJXalaJfD5
1616063124129316865 2023-01-19 13:20:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I’m going to build an MVP for a startup.   It will be a Rover competitor that will send a local dog walker to any house in my neighborhood for a 20-minute, $35 walk.  The business will be automated, cost less than $25 &amp; 30 minutes to build, and be functional with zero code.  ↓

1615750625656012800 2023-01-18 16:39:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JayMacBiz I agree with that.
1615750555619524609 2023-01-18 16:38:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NHammondDesign I can imagine it's not easy.
1615750450342494208 2023-01-18 16:38:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Damn - I love that.
1615749670017421312 2023-01-18 16:35:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Leonardo Da Vinci had a saying:  "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."  It's a reminder that the more complex people make things, the less they understand them.  So, ignore jargon users &amp; the overly complicated.  Instead, follow those who simplify the complex.
1615708268671733764 2023-01-18 13:50:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fitnessmanou True story.

1615707162260701185 2023-01-18 13:46:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mauraball It's just a number I chose to suggest it's worth my time. I try to move quickly and I can see myself getting stuck on that if I don't just pick something and move on.
1615706132877639680 2023-01-18 13:42:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @themartinlilly Thanks, Martin!

1615704079237365760 2023-01-18 13:34:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thank you, my friend.
1615704037302886407 2023-01-18 13:33:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chenso_kendall There probably is, but audience growth is a good one.

1615703905488216066 2023-01-18 13:33:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gera_wsl Absolutely.
1615703848315916288 2023-01-18 13:33:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ant_carlton I don't sell it anymore. It's included in the LinkedIn OS
1615703781160747008 2023-01-18 13:32:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @geerodge You're welcome!
1615703750341009410 2023-01-18 13:32:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Of course!
1615703724747268096 2023-01-18 13:32:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder So much cash, but also such an opportunity to impact at scale.

1615701935541174272 2023-01-18 13:25:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  1. Listen for problems 2. Find a solution that already exists 3. Promote it 4. See if it sells 5. Send the content to someone on Fiverr to put together 6. Review the work 7. Distribute to audience

1615701924761722880 2023-01-18 13:25:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Outsourced the Creation:  I went onto Fiverr and found someone who could pull that data into an eBook.

1615701900514525184 2023-01-18 13:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Announced the New Product Online:  I used some old copy from another product launch and updated it to announce The Swipe File.   I wrote about it on Tuesday, July 20th, 2021  https://t.co/psdwEWsejb
1615701892310650880 2023-01-18 13:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Listened For Problems That Can Be Solved:  Someone on LinkedIn told me they save a lot of my posts but wished there was an easier way to access them.  I had a simple idea to solve this.  Just like that, the "Swipe File" was born.  My top 50 pieces of content, seen 21M+ times.
1615701889990942720 2023-01-18 13:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I spent $40.93 and 10 minutes to generate $7,500 in sales.  Here's how:
1615696733773889540 2023-01-18 13:04:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl Of course I recommended it! Your book is fabulous, Arvid.

1615437237474283520 2023-01-17 19:53:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Exactly, Joseph. Karma.
1615437194075967488 2023-01-17 19:53:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic It's not even that hard :)
1615437162203451394 2023-01-17 19:53:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegoldsuite Absolutely, Sharyph.
1615437131907833857 2023-01-17 19:53:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza That's the correct mindset.
1615430060348956694 2023-01-17 19:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every time you're angry about someone's success &amp; want to write a shitty comment to them on Twitter, just send someone you admire else a really nice note instead.  You'll feel better, grow faster, and have an insane network.

1615395845796397079 2023-01-17 17:09:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe I've started adding a bit of human touch this year.  More enjoyable for me, hopefully more enjoyable for others.
1615387281489121281 2023-01-17 16:35:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Social media algorithms &amp; trends change daily.  How people behave won't change in your lifetime.
1615350979330969603 2023-01-17 14:10:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BlinkBackVideo Same.

1615342529183977474 2023-01-17 13:37:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bitocrates @chrisguillebeau Then you might have something.
1615342406643159044 2023-01-17 13:36:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder It's an awesome book.
1615341346080063492 2023-01-17 13:32:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Well shit. I appreciate that, man. Right back at you.
1615340811041882112 2023-01-17 13:30:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge @wdmorrisjr Ooh. This looks interesting.
1615340187336278018 2023-01-17 13:28:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chenso_kendall A yellow highlighter for me.

1615340029336817664 2023-01-17 13:27:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattchiacpa I love that.
1615339963888852992 2023-01-17 13:27:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy Funny thing is, I've read these over (probably) 10 years. I actually don't read very much (sorry to burst the bubble!😂)
1615339836616884224 2023-01-17 13:26:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Yes. When to Jump by Mike Lewis.
1615339801502179329 2023-01-17 13:26:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel @shl Love them.
1615339698792144896 2023-01-17 13:26:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert How do you like them?
1615338611997646851 2023-01-17 13:21:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ASimpleNotion @shl Similar, but more focused on entrepreneurship in general.
1615338526845079555 2023-01-17 13:21:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mohitbatham_ @chrisguillebeau Same, Mohit.
1615338497996619776 2023-01-17 13:21:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It's one of the books that has helped keep me sane over the last 3 years.
1615338414877843457 2023-01-17 13:21:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ProcureBites Game changer, Tom.
1615337963092676608 2023-01-17 13:19:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it for today.  If you enjoyed this thread, then I'd greatly appreciate if you:  1.

1615337960471248896 2023-01-17 13:19:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When to Jump by Mike Lewis  How it helped:  The book that convinced me to quit my job when I was ready. Lots of people don't like the book, but it gave me motivation.  Key quote:  "There is a difference between crazy and stupid. The difference lies in knowing when to jump."  https://t.co/SWutJwj5Pp
1615337954175483904 2023-01-17 13:19:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Company of One by Paul Jarvis  How it helped:  Paul breaks down the benefits of staying small, rather than going big.

1615337933988306946 2023-01-17 13:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Psychology of Money by @morganhousel  How it helped:  Helped me set up a better strategy to feel financially secure &amp; is the only finance book I've found interesting.  Key quote:  “Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money."  https://t.co/mFApHOGQEo

This book helps keep me positive.  Key quote:  “There’s no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.”  https://t.co/Lc8xwcjs7p
1615337920478470145 2023-01-17 13:19:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Atomic Habits by @JamesClear  How it helped:  Gave me systems and frameworks for building strong, repeatable habits.

1615337891978252288 2023-01-17 13:18:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10 books that played an important role in building my 7-figure business:
1615133737989165057 2023-01-16 23:47:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JordanTLynch @morganhousel @heydannymiranda Thanks, Jordan! Always nice to hear something like that.
1615070144568655874 2023-01-16 19:35:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ModestMitkus Producing content is one thing.  Then what? You have to be somewhat business savvy to get any use out of AI.
1615069915832016897 2023-01-16 19:34:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattchiacpa @Joseph__Seifert Prompting is one thing.   Knowing what to do with the information presented is another.
1615069794063056902 2023-01-16 19:33:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markstruczewski You cannot (effectively)
1615069611057094659 2023-01-16 19:32:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theshahkunal It will help extremely smart people.  People who don't understand business will waste tons of time.
1615069482107502606 2023-01-16 19:32:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide That's it right there :)
1615067674123403265 2023-01-16 19:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You have to master natural intelligence before artificial intelligence becomes useful.
1615059698989899777 2023-01-16 18:53:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Congrats :) That's huge!
1615037875405324289 2023-01-16 17:26:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LawyerLiam Interesting perspective. I think of it a bit differently.   Sure, Amazon has "taken over" (can't argue that) but there are probably hundreds of thousands of small Shopify brands making $500,000+  I think the opportunity to be a 6-figure or 7-figure creator will be here to stay.
1615032288055787520 2023-01-16 17:04:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Perfectly stated, Danny.
1615032074825789443 2023-01-16 17:03:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamiePGood You're using it now.
1615032037060104194 2023-01-16 17:03:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rfordej Oh, for sure.
1615031838233198597 2023-01-16 17:02:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsNickPayne Exactly. Never been cheaper. Never been easier.
1615031738454925313 2023-01-16 17:02:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adityatheverma It's a required skill.
1615031676572209152 2023-01-16 17:02:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alanwmarch Worth it 100x over.
1615031606049112069 2023-01-16 17:01:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LawyerLiam Curious - what makes you say that?
1615031558175326226 2023-01-16 17:01:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjustincscott Will people take advantage of it? That's the question.
1615031492337627139 2023-01-16 17:01:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Yep - if you can't get past that, it's certainly difficult.
1615024896341311495 2023-01-16 16:35:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The decline of traditional media puts power in the hands of the Solopreneur.  Constant learning, creativity, resiliency, and discomfort are the keys to success in this new landscape.  Best of all? We nearly all have access.   A truly wild time.
1615018513466359808 2023-01-16 16:09:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJackForge If you have the means, always tip your server well.   I have a hunch this gets passed forward often.
1614991057388716035 2023-01-16 14:20:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Same. I stopped coaching for this reason.
1614990869194543104 2023-01-16 14:20:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tobi_emonts I honestly don't know.  100% are in it to make money and we should normalize the desire to earn money &amp; build wonderful lives without guilt.  I would guess a large percentage want to make an impact, but on what level, I'm not sure.
1614980660254445570 2023-01-16 13:39:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks It really is, Alex. BTW - did I see you crossed an MRR milestone the other day or am I remembering that wrong?
1614978890874732552 2023-01-16 13:32:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CHBernasconiC If you do that, you might just hit 10k MRR anyways.
1614978808964329474 2023-01-16 13:32:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maffeodrinks Something like that. I black out often when I'm talking ;-)
1614978672292761600 2023-01-16 13:31:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Oh. I really like that. Where did you hear it?
1614978564088029185 2023-01-16 13:31:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Say yes early, say no later. One of my faves.
1614978500657836033 2023-01-16 13:30:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattchiacpa Thanks, Matt.
1614978368608296961 2023-01-16 13:30:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexanderFYoung More can also be more, as long as it's the right "more".
1614978277923295233 2023-01-16 13:30:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmillspatrick I'd establish a minimum income stipulation.  What do I need to live my life comfortably and what type of work am I willing to do to get there?  In the beginning, maybe you have to do more work that you don't like, but as you get more tuned in, you can start being a bit more picky
1614977972515086338 2023-01-16 13:28:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvanThomson01 Exactly. Ask yourself: "Am I willing to do what it takes to scale to X?"   Then, just be honest.
1614977366622892033 2023-01-16 13:26:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSoleJasper That's the truth, Jasper.
1614977120932970498 2023-01-16 13:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The happiest solopreneurs I know don't maximize income.  They maximize income to effort ratio.  Their goal is to build a lifestyle where they enjoy the fruits of their labor, rather than being addicted to the almighty dollar.  If you can't ever say no, you'll always be trapped.

1614756169926545409 2023-01-15 22:47:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davecraige I wish you the best with your business. I'm bummed to see you attack me for no reason with very little context, and having never purchased or participated in a product of mine. Have a good night, Dave. I genuinely wish you well.
1614753997331787777 2023-01-15 22:38:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davecraige People want the knowledge I have, they pay for it, and 99.9% of people love the product. Is that a grift? Sounds like a successful business.  I suppose all authors who put their knowledge in books and then sell it are grifters by this definition too.
1614744528598048770 2023-01-15 22:01:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davecraige My landing page copy for my course and the Tweet I wrote about how to simplify big daunting goals into smaller goals don't appear to be related.  I guess I'm not understanding your point here. Mind elaborating?   Genuinely happy to answer.
1614667600339914754 2023-01-15 16:55:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Good stuff, man.
1614637402789711873 2023-01-15 14:55:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennishegstad @thesamparr That's just the software side, but the only person I have (had) was a VA for $750 per month. I no longer have a VA but am actively hiring.   Even so, margins are still above 90%.
1614633171437621248 2023-01-15 14:38:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregmushen @thesamparr @dennishegstad  https://t.co/O9q8RHjvRm  I'll probably increase costs this year by adding something like ConvertKit and maybe doing a brand redesign.   But all businesses have costs.
1614632590987886592 2023-01-15 14:36:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thesamparr @dennishegstad I spend about $623 per month to run a $190,000 per month information product business.
1614628557371613184 2023-01-15 14:20:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gneuman I use social media. But there are many ways.
1614618283256479744 2023-01-15 13:39:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheTomYoungs The upside is enormous, but most people want the upside first.
1614616409975185408 2023-01-15 13:32:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlanJLSmith Most info products aren't recurring revenue, so no.
1614616198477406209 2023-01-15 13:31:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisDu83309085 Yep.
1614616081636671495 2023-01-15 13:30:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @benjaminlatsko It doesn't account for either. It's just an example.
1614616016125919232 2023-01-15 13:30:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DadMoneyClub Followers aren't a good proxy for web traffic unless you drive 100% of your web traffic from social media.
1614613558377037824 2023-01-15 13:20:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JonGumero True. Plus it’s just easier.
1614613454798704640 2023-01-15 13:20:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheHunterBohm Get after it man.
1614612581552996352 2023-01-15 13:16:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Making $200k/yr selling info products broken down:  - $16.7k per month - Which is ~$540/day - Which is 4 customers @ $135/ea - Which is 285 daily web visitors at 1.4% conversion  None of this is easy.  But it's certainly easier than staring $200k in the face without a plan.

1614331230375354368 2023-01-14 18:38:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SonnyBlaze702 It was influenced by watching two people argue on Twitter about politics for 20 minutes.
1614286340824104962 2023-01-14 15:40:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IterateIdeas @thedankoe Did Dan write that? Shit. Sorry Dan 😂 must have been subliminally influenced.
1614285641176563718 2023-01-14 15:37:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You can get a lot of free time back by simply not having an opinion on everything.
1614278836341952513 2023-01-14 15:10:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bentossell @nevmed @copy_ai @Superhuman @levelsio Yes please. 🔥
1614278506237632513 2023-01-14 15:09:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Congrats Alex!
1614252804876697601 2023-01-14 13:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ A unique offer alone gets you further than 90%.
1614251214685749249 2023-01-14 13:20:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aryan_kochhar I have plenty of close friends who are at a level of success that is intimidating to me.   That, in no way, shapes whether or not we're friends.  Life isn't all about growth, you're right. I'm assuming people will read this as leaning toward business.
1614250462542442497 2023-01-14 13:17:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsLeeBrain Definitely. Remaining humble throughout the process is critical.
1614250373719392257 2023-01-14 13:17:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AbduKhol That's the key right there, Abdu.
1614250291930533890 2023-01-14 13:17:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess If you want to get in good shape, hang around with people who are in good shape.  Want to build a business? Hang around with business builders.  It's just true...
1614249389425364994 2023-01-14 13:13:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @numbufera Will always be true.
1614249312023715840 2023-01-14 13:13:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Fijian_flow727 You too, Bradley.
1614249274253926401 2023-01-14 13:13:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachary_ashburn It's the best place to find people 10x smarter than myself.

1613940030925414401 2023-01-13 16:44:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Not even close.
1613937734292312073 2023-01-13 16:35:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People will do anything to learn about business other than start one.

1613907749993156608 2023-01-13 14:36:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni I'm looking fwd to sending it, Kurtis. Thanks, man.
1613906550434959360 2023-01-13 14:31:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Keep growing brother!
1613906333031333889 2023-01-13 14:30:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Thanks, man. Just the truth.
1613906286424236034 2023-01-13 14:30:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattchiacpa That was 2018. Kept most of it off. Some I didn't. Trimming down now. Fast.
1613906186029654017 2023-01-13 14:29:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Put some of it back on. In the process of working it right back off :)
1613906119868522499 2023-01-13 14:29:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Thanks, Bryan!
1613889916693250048 2023-01-13 13:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I started burning out again.  Same grind, same hours, same abuse - all brought on by me.  I was the culprit. The one to blame.  So, rather than look for a quick fix, I worked to improve in 7 areas.  Tomorrow, I'll break it down for 72,433 subscribers:    https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
1613889914583617543 2023-01-13 13:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> On December 16th, 2018 I had a massive panic attack.  It was the culmination of 10+ years of long hours, stress, and loss of control.  So I quit my job.  I spent the next year losing 40 lbs, working on my mental health, and building my own business.  But then something happened:
1613714250144583680 2023-01-13 01:47:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets I'll obviously hit ya up when I'm headed there. Forgot you're nearby.
1613714110369206273 2023-01-13 01:46:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @khemaridh @danshipper Thanks for the rec Khe. Hope you're well my friend.
1613695321103831040 2023-01-13 00:32:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ You in BK?
1613695241638350850 2023-01-13 00:31:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @foreplayzach @RyanBegelman Let’s do it.
1613672338469306372 2023-01-12 23:00:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Sam_DuncanB Part of the reason we moved here.
1613671423897223169 2023-01-12 22:57:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sammarelich Cool. I'll let you know when I'm headed into town.
1613669937729380352 2023-01-12 22:51:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Recently moved 1.5 hours north of NYC to the Catskills.  I'd like to spend one weekend per month in the city.  Who from the creator/solopreneur space is still living there?  Would love to meet some interesting folks for a coffee.
1613610232407523352 2023-01-12 18:53:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW That Justin Welsh fella is sneaky.
1613608401040179203 2023-01-12 18:46:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_adityajethwa Any fear-confirming grifter.
1613531891830767617 2023-01-12 13:42:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Marcusluft Yep. That's my recommendation at the end. Start with one, master it, add another.
1613530981914361860 2023-01-12 13:38:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Social influences many of the others, which is why it's so important.
1613530916634198017 2023-01-12 13:38:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hesbythesea Social media content on LinkedIn to start.
1613530846685990912 2023-01-12 13:38:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Honestly, I think direct traffic is a result of organic + social + referral. The more you get your name out there, the more people search for it. It's almost an outcome vs. a target. Does that make sense?
1613530640531464193 2023-01-12 13:37:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Definitely. I'm branching out drastically this year.
1613530595753091073 2023-01-12 13:37:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Appreciate it, man.
1613529187763224577 2023-01-12 13:31:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Probably 2-3 days. Moving a bit slow :)
1613529111267364869 2023-01-12 13:31:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Dude - same.
1613529025305260032 2023-01-12 13:31:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @C47 100%. One of the rare ones.
1613528652745940998 2023-01-12 13:29:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CicmilJovan It really is. It impacts everything.
1613528624509980672 2023-01-12 13:29:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MRatcliffe_RB Definitely. All in time. It's an iterative game which makes it fun.
1613528520105271301 2023-01-12 13:29:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Definitely. I'm just on 2 of them. Going for 3 here soon.
1613528468490276871 2023-01-12 13:28:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy Traffic first, then product even.
1613527542736080896 2023-01-12 13:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lastly, I would be greatly appreciative if you'd RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience.

1613527538873024512 2023-01-12 13:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> To recap the 5 types of web traffic:  • Direct Traffic • Organic Traffic • Referral Traffic • Social Traffic • Paid Traffic  Here's my recommendation:   Attack one channel get really good at it, and then bolt on another.  Don't try to master them all at once!
1613527536884916225 2023-01-12 13:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Paid Traffic:  Paid traffic comes from people who visit your website after clicking on an ad that you paid for.  Why it's good: Fast, easier to track, campaign optimizations, etc.  How to get some: Run ads (Meta, Insta, LinkedIn, etc.) or hire an agency to run ads on your behalf.
1613527535068876800 2023-01-12 13:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Social Media Traffic:  Social media traffic means people visit your website after clicking on a social media post.  Why it's good: Builds a lot more awareness at the top of your marketing funnel!  How to get some: Post regularly &amp; drive people to the website on your profile.
1613527533269487616 2023-01-12 13:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Referral Traffic:  Referral traffic happens when someone visits your website by clicking on a link from somewhere else.  Why it's good: Sends potentially qualified visitors to your website from trusted sources.  How to get some: Guest blog posts, podcasts, newsletter trades, etc.
1613527531306582019 2023-01-12 13:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Organic Traffic:  Organic traffic comes from visits to your website through different search engines.  Why it's good: This traffic comes from people searching for something specific, increasing your lead quality.  How to get some: Analyze keyword gaps &amp; low-competition keywords.
1613527529410727938 2023-01-12 13:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Direct Traffic:  Direct traffic basically means users who visit your site by directly typing in the URL.  Why it's good: Shows your brand is becoming popular with searchers.  How to get some: Become known for one specific thing &amp; increase your social presence &amp; social network.
1613527526680166402 2023-01-12 13:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every Solopreneur must generate internet traffic.  And if you can master getting traffic from multiple sources, you can build a 6-figure business.  A simple breakdown of 5 types of web traffic (and how to get some):
1613352782412513280 2023-01-12 01:50:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thesamparr I agree.   I lived in all 3, and each one was instrumental in helping my career grow substantially.   I encourage everyone I know to live in NYC once. It’s an energy you can’t get elsewhere in the US, IMO.
1613346858243325959 2023-01-12 01:27:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley Glad you're ok my friend ❤️❤️

1613180511249367049 2023-01-11 14:26:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak I've interviewed thousands of people. Less than 2% have probably asked questions this good.
1613166489204293634 2023-01-11 13:30:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @remoteoliver Most people are conditioned to believe they have no choice.
1613165926991413249 2023-01-11 13:28:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the_mvp_guy Or angry.
1613165879784607745 2023-01-11 13:28:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsmarcosruiz Yep.
1613165859135971328 2023-01-11 13:28:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess That's exactly it, Marcus.
1613165141905793024 2023-01-11 13:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Being a Solopreneur is extremely hard, but it's not as hard as feeling undervalued for 2,100+ hours per year.

1612885022695981056 2023-01-10 18:52:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Great topic.   Curious question - outside of Huberman, there has to be someone else worth listening to.   Any thoughts on who?
1612879026623848452 2023-01-10 18:28:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tony_Lantes Gracias por presentarme, Tony.  Realmente lo aprecio. Salud.
1612874357738508289 2023-01-10 18:09:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe  https://t.co/gLSHj0MAdN
1612852404550090752 2023-01-10 16:42:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe If I could recommend something that makes this entire path easier to navigate, it's marketing/self-promotion/PR.  Attention makes anything you do easier and faster.  More feedback, faster feedback, better feedback.
1612851824477831168 2023-01-10 16:40:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ranbirsinghlive You either are the marketing funnel or you're in one.
1612851732496920576 2023-01-10 16:39:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @selvas__ Not all of them. In fact, I'd argue most people who run our governments are great at promoting themselves and do almost nothing.
1612851593493491712 2023-01-10 16:39:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UnderstoryBard True story.
1612851311745335297 2023-01-10 16:38:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @petecallaghans Sure, sometimes.  But, when I do, I pull back or figure out a way to make it more automated.  Balance is key for me.
1612850411290988552 2023-01-10 16:34:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfanimations Unless you understand the game.
1612850146563194881 2023-01-10 16:33:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvanThomson01 Yep.
1612850031429558273 2023-01-10 16:33:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @leandromachado_ It's a painful truth even for extroverts.
1612849838676221953 2023-01-10 16:32:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collinmcooper Feels truer and truer by the day.
1612849610258612225 2023-01-10 16:31:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Once you realize the whole world is run by shameless self-promoters you almost have no choice but to put yourself out there.
1612808224352206853 2023-01-10 13:46:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Definitely. This should have been the first step, and I just skipped it like a dummy 😂
1612807992130547712 2023-01-10 13:46:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Fear of failure ranks very highly for me.  It's what has kept me from delegating for a long time.   Great thread, Dave.
1612807772113870851 2023-01-10 13:45:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @waronweakness I've had less than probably 5 people put in that level of work, and 100% of those have led to long-term relationships.   Great comment, Eddy.
1612806953603932160 2023-01-10 13:41:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanbaugh27 SO far. I almost never get them.   When I do, it's so awesome.
1612806817679122432 2023-01-10 13:41:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Exactly. It's not: "Will you be my mentor?"  It's identifying someone who is perfect to help you achieve a very specific thing, and then building a mutually beneficial relationship for years to come.
1612806525118214144 2023-01-10 13:40:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarcAngelosNYC Yep. I think I mentioned to ask what they need in return? I may have missed it though.
1612806399032950784 2023-01-10 13:39:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday I love that. Met @noahkagan a few weeks ago. Super sharp, super nice guy.
1612806317474709505 2023-01-10 13:39:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge 100%.
1612806279298273289 2023-01-10 13:39:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak That's right.   It's not: "Hey I have a business idea" and then a mentor comes and makes you millions.  It's "Hey I have a business idea" and then a mentor shows you a couple of steps to take your first action.
1612804694992392192 2023-01-10 13:32:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mginstar Well then you need to try something different other than, "How can I get you to be my mentor?"
1612804590084452352 2023-01-10 13:32:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JayMacBiz Yep. I hear that all of the time.
1612804544978624513 2023-01-10 13:32:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai I'd say @dickiebush and @Nicolascole77 were 2 of the first who helped me navigate the landscape effectively.
1612804414749954052 2023-01-10 13:31:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ 100%. You do this well, Matt.
1612804368494989312 2023-01-10 13:31:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Definitely. It's probably the most important part and I left it out. Whoops.
1612804286874017801 2023-01-10 13:31:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @callmehouck Less than 1% of people who ask me something, make it specific, and easy to answer/say yes to.
1612804164785938432 2023-01-10 13:30:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thesyedhuq Yep.
1612804140899487744 2023-01-10 13:30:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel One of the most critical parts.
1612804101011546117 2023-01-10 13:30:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Someone just reached out after I posted this and asked: "How can I get you as my mentor?"   🤦‍♂️
1612802436304977922 2023-01-10 13:23:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lastly, if you enjoyed this, I would be greatly appreciative if you'd RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience.  Have a great Tuesday.
1612802434148990976 2023-01-10 13:23:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> To recap:  • Survey landscape • Look for specialists • Reach out • Hyper-specific ask • Share results • Always climb  Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more content like this.  I also write about this and more in my newsletter. Join 72K+ others:   https://t.co/xAMv4vmdw6
1612802432290930688 2023-01-10 13:23:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Always Climb:  As you do this, you'll constantly move a rung up the ladder.  The best thing you can do is strive to be the weakest member of your inner circle at all times.  This means you are always growing, learning, and changing faster than anyone you know.
1612802430059560960 2023-01-10 13:23:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Share Results:  To close the loop, take their advice &amp; remember to share the impact.  Take what you learned and see if there is something of value you can do in return.  Unsure? Ask them!  You'll be surprised to find out that people you admire need help too.
1612802427459100672 2023-01-10 13:23:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Hyper-Specific Ask:  Your "ask" should be specific &amp; thoughtful.  Show them you are taking steps towards a specific goal &amp; believe only their expertise can help.   This demonstrates that you value their advice and believe their response can make a significant impact.
1612802424795717634 2023-01-10 13:23:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Reach Out:  To land a mentor, you must reach out.  Start by expressing gratitude &amp; explain how their advice has inspired you to take action.  Then, make an ask in a way that adds value. The best way?   Show them you have done something extraordinary because of their advice.
1612802422325366784 2023-01-10 13:23:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Look for Specialists:  Consider what specific skills you want to develop.  Start by finding mentors who specialize in those core areas and are 2-3 steps ahead of you, not at the top of the mountain.  Look for relevant experience in the beginning, rather than status.
1612802420085559297 2023-01-10 13:23:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Survey the Landscape:  Curate a list of individuals in your field of interest.   Follow them online and pay close attention to their interactions to get a better understanding of what makes them tick.  Building a SaaS marketplace? You'd damn well better know the players.
1612802417476734979 2023-01-10 13:23:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How elite performers attract world-class mentors.  A proven, 6-step method you can use today:
1612528269605101569 2023-01-09 19:14:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Hey man - also considering #6 but in a non-traditional way. Lmk if you wanna chat on it.

1612512483331170331 2023-01-09 18:11:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Understood. Thanks, Bryan.
1612509696207773716 2023-01-09 18:00:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Just curious - what makes it fluff?
1612509536388108288 2023-01-09 18:00:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ViktorRevesz About 2 hours.
1612508974003150855 2023-01-09 17:57:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomharari Love it!
1612508892063227905 2023-01-09 17:57:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor I will write a newsletter about it after launching, promoting.
1612508753013739523 2023-01-09 17:57:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic I hope so too.
1612508631089438720 2023-01-09 17:56:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IrishJFK A cancelation from a sponsor. I'll recap once done.
1612508479771533329 2023-01-09 17:55:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @deisbel Thank you.
1612508463564787713 2023-01-09 17:55:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @torreydawley Haha.
1612508420963434496 2023-01-09 17:55:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oliverhackett I don't think so. Maybe.  Either way, I'll recap in public.
1612508333356814336 2023-01-09 17:55:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Could be a 50k+ business for maybe 2+ hours of work.  I'll do a write up in 6-12 months.
1612507996361302018 2023-01-09 17:53:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I just got a sneaky good idea for a new micro-business.  - Light lift - High revenue potential - Incredibly high margins - Distribution channel already built  Domain purchased &amp; tech stack set.  Let the building begin.
1612506327560904720 2023-01-09 17:47:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Congrats, Katelyn!
1612506296506277888 2023-01-09 17:47:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew My guess? Very well.
1612489441980948480 2023-01-09 16:40:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dealconfession The thing I dislike about FIRE is that it suggests living life in 2 phases: accumulation and enjoyment.  Many people accumulate and something happens where they never get to enjoy.  I'd rather merge them together.
1612489239970865152 2023-01-09 16:39:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EmJoServices Maybe.  Some people are doing something they love but taking clients they don't love - why? The almighty dollar.
1612489059355566081 2023-01-09 16:38:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD It's an incredibly difficult mindset shift.  Maybe one of the hardest.
1612488982113165312 2023-01-09 16:38:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Most people who make a lot of money spend a lot of time doing things they hate with people they dislike.
1612488440280645635 2023-01-09 16:36:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Web3_Savant The worst kind.
1612488407925538825 2023-01-09 16:36:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IterateIdeas I feel that. I used to do the same thing.
1612487924498448386 2023-01-09 16:34:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It doesn't matter if you work for yourself or someone else - as long as your calendar is filled with unwanted obligations, you're not truly wealthy.
1612474572040806404 2023-01-09 15:41:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ADutchEngineer @scrumtuous @anna__geller @DataScienceHarp @unclebobmartin Thanks, Sarah!
1612453397730320392 2023-01-09 14:17:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak If you miss getting the salary you want, you miss all of the compounding over time as well.
1612447443399892992 2023-01-09 13:53:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ The simplest formula ever.
1612446898836721665 2023-01-09 13:51:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew So smart. I still suck at this.
1612444770961334272 2023-01-09 13:42:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni I've forgotten more than I remember.
1612443756602564608 2023-01-09 13:38:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ZeeZee_ETH That's silly. 99.999999% of people do nothing with information.
1612443646825009152 2023-01-09 13:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PradeepB_Tweets Yep. Information doesn't replace wisdown.
1612443570559934464 2023-01-09 13:37:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ViktorRevesz I take notes on a lot of things. I also forget to often.
1612443439588675588 2023-01-09 13:37:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom And the easiest.
1612443392339845122 2023-01-09 13:37:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hesbythesea Most people give up on everything too early.
1612443319090532353 2023-01-09 13:36:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Good stuff here, Leo.
1612443279571787777 2023-01-09 13:36:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Everyone's trying to be an "expert" and missing the millions of people a few steps behind them...
1612443185170505729 2023-01-09 13:36:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Man - this is so smart, Sachin.
1612443138496385024 2023-01-09 13:36:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz I've missed so many notes, myself. I wish I had more.
1612443094326325248 2023-01-09 13:36:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Easy peasy.
1612440369735651328 2023-01-09 13:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship 101:   Work on yourself, take notes, share them with others.
1612264548819677186 2023-01-09 01:46:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Love it. Highly considering.
1612215995170529282 2023-01-08 22:33:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thepatwalls This is really great, Pat.  Love the video!
1612078474549776385 2023-01-08 13:27:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Exactly.  Knowledge is a commodity now. Wisdom is what will win.
1612078371378237444 2023-01-08 13:26:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Nice thread, Matt.  Now people have the instructions. Acting on them is the next step.
1612076224234364928 2023-01-08 13:18:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OzolinsJanis For sure, Janis.  I enjoy a good curation or a nice list of things I wasn't aware of everyone once in a while.  But I'm in awe of those who can share true and personal lessons from their unique and specific journey.   That's what I'm here for.
1612074575314952193 2023-01-08 13:11:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Sure. I do it sometimes as well.  But I love following people because of something they did or think personally.
1612074450278555651 2023-01-08 13:11:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexxroy Exactly.
1612074148398006272 2023-01-08 13:10:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theleoalexandru Your journey is your unique product.
1612073983129649152 2023-01-08 13:09:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LeadGrowThrive Be authentic unless you are authentically not interesting.  If that's the case, go do interesting things.
1612073896609550339 2023-01-08 13:09:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JustAnotherPM This is one thought of many.
1612073863558332419 2023-01-08 13:08:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Haha. Hardly the goat, but I try my best to share unique thoughts.
1612073211205750787 2023-01-08 13:06:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tweeting listicle threads all day will get you some attention, but rarely trust or revenue.  Go out on a limb and tell me something interesting you've done, think or believe in.  Not something you Googled.

1611833275051384832 2023-01-07 21:12:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki If I ever joined a company again in my life it would definitely be pre Series A.
1611799328770740225 2023-01-07 18:58:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @johnnyxbrown Many thanks for including me here, Johnny. Not sure how I missed this a few days ago.  Much appreciated 🙏🏻
1611795729043058688 2023-01-07 18:43:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshFromCMG Thank you, Joshua. Much appreciated, man.
1611795653620895747 2023-01-07 18:43:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GoLimitlesss This is awesome. Absolutely love it.
1611779634646994950 2023-01-07 17:39:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Don't let a customer treat you poorly. Nip that in the bud and move on. Lots of customers out there.
1611779471324979200 2023-01-07 17:39:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 A good exercise might be going through your daily routine and asking yourself what you hate doing that also doesn’t do much for your business (if you haven’t already). Surprisingly I found some stuff that was easy to cut.
1611779227430305793 2023-01-07 17:38:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Love how you framed that, Dan.  If you know how to find an answer, the exercise of finding it will teach you way more than simply being told.
1611727377276751873 2023-01-07 14:12:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Appreciate your kind words, Ben 💪
1611725547796631553 2023-01-07 14:04:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Same. Perfectionism has always been a killer for me.
1611725472127139842 2023-01-07 14:04:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy Brainstorm a few times per week mostly.
1611725321761427457 2023-01-07 14:03:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill Thanks, Barrett!
1611725198549565440 2023-01-07 14:03:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Ain’t that the truth.
1611717227874500608 2023-01-07 13:31:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni When reports of mine would knock on my door and ask a question they could find in a document, it was my least favorite conversation to have.
1611717029651976192 2023-01-07 13:30:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Exactly. People will be forced to call you lucky if you work that long and hard.
1611716951944073217 2023-01-07 13:30:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Antogando1 That, I agree with.
1611716893181607936 2023-01-07 13:30:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @takezopure Yep. Mantra: Stay alive.
1611716780749381633 2023-01-07 13:29:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Exactly, Jason. That's where it misses.
1611716303592595456 2023-01-07 13:28:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dailyfloww Thank you.
1611716270059036674 2023-01-07 13:27:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje A huge difference. I love the latter.
1611715969117786113 2023-01-07 13:26:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew For sure. And the only way to get 100,000 eyeballs is to pump a bunch of stuff out, find what works, and then narrow in.
1611715872183181317 2023-01-07 13:26:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collinmcooper You have to.
1611715850683179009 2023-01-07 13:26:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSoleJasper Keep going, Jasper.
1611715116147302402 2023-01-07 13:23:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it for today.  If you enjoyed this, I would be greatly appreciative if you'd:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1611715114155089920 2023-01-07 13:23:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Like business content like this?  Each week 70,000+ my subscribers get one tip to launch, grow, and monetize their internet business:   https://t.co/xAMv4vmdw6
1611715107750350849 2023-01-07 13:23:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you have faith in yourself, you don't need a Plan B:  Again, randomness and chance are at play here.  Build your career like a venture capitalist, not a venture-backed founder.  Have a plan A, B, C, D, E, and F.  Increase your chances, and decrease your risk.
1611715105489620992 2023-01-07 13:23:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Work a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life:  I love my job more than anything.  I've transitioned out of executive leadership in tech and into a full-time creator helping thousands of people.  It's still a ton of work.   The most work I've ever done.
1611715103224651776 2023-01-07 13:23:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Good things come to those who wait:  Good things come to those who take action in the short term and stay consistent in the long term.  Waiting and waiting until everything is "perfect" will yield the opposite of "good things".  It will likely yield nothing.
1611715101161148418 2023-01-07 13:23:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are no stupid questions:  "Stupid" is a pretty subjective term, but there are questions that can easily be Googled.  If you skip Googling and ask (at work, in life, etc.) you'll be labeled as a liability rather than an asset.  Teaching yourself is a wonderful habit.
1611715098124378112 2023-01-07 13:23:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Cheaters never win:  Nearly everyone who is someone has cheated in their ascension to the top.  It doesn't necessarily make it right, but it's 100% true.  And unfortunately, that's why we have a lot of poor academics and rich criminals.  Always be heavily skeptical.
1611715096077651969 2023-01-07 13:23:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Quality over quantity:  Not at all in the beginning.  When you're just starting out in any new endeavor, repetition matters.  So start with quantity to help find the quality.  Then do both - high output, high quality.   Win/Win.
1611715089018544132 2023-01-07 13:23:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Money doesn't buy happiness:  It may not buy happiness, but it buys freedom and flexibility.  The more that you have, the easier it is to say no to things you don't like.  Doing less of what you hate and more of what you like makes you a much happier person.
1611715086262878209 2023-01-07 13:23:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most business clichés are lies.  Here are 7 of the worst:

1611450824265273344 2023-01-06 19:53:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Thanks, man!   200,000 📈
1611409342569267213 2023-01-06 17:08:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mayukh_goswami I don't hire as a one-person business, but surely good advice if you're building a small company.
1611409168266575887 2023-01-06 17:07:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gid_dev Organic social.
1611409079578017806 2023-01-06 17:07:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonbrosio Excellent additions, Jon.
1611407151381069824 2023-01-06 16:59:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CrushingDigital Systematize your most important input.  For me, that's producing high-quality content daily, so that's probably #1 for me (could change in the future).
1611405978628407312 2023-01-06 16:54:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulineRiviere The moment ego starts to dominate is the moment you start to slip.
1611405603863150599 2023-01-06 16:53:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChetanKale_ Definitely key as you grow.
1611405457893265412 2023-01-06 16:52:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danielcberk Missed that one. Huge killer.
1611405229462900737 2023-01-06 16:51:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simplybysusanne Most are.
1611405212324872197 2023-01-06 16:51:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SVTHOTH Future business woman.
1611405138014666752 2023-01-06 16:51:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mike_begg It's not controversy per se. It's understanding what you're against and using it in a strategic way.
1611404774225678336 2023-01-06 16:50:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8 one-person business killers:  1. A huge ego 2. Not networking 3. No experimenting 4. Ignoring feedback 5. Too many meetings 6. Very little marketing 7. Not saying "no" enough 8. Lack of business systems  Avoid as many of these as possible.
1611359597633191936 2023-01-06 13:50:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @xBenJamminx Correct.  You don't have to attack. I rarely (if ever) do.
1611359180392112128 2023-01-06 13:49:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IamRaivo Yep. And it doesn't have to be mean, cruel, or divisive.
1611358809506865152 2023-01-06 13:47:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adamzaorski It doesn't have to be controversial.  If someone is always making it controversial, I'd argue they don't actually understand it all that well.
1611358627004129280 2023-01-06 13:46:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom See ya there, Sahil.
1611358506086731776 2023-01-06 13:46:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realmememen It's working.
1611358479536779267 2023-01-06 13:46:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @meraperspective It doesn't have to be extreme at all.
1611358437778006016 2023-01-06 13:46:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @a11hard Haha.
1611358375383633920 2023-01-06 13:45:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RahulHakhla No, that's not my enemy.
1611358190070792192 2023-01-06 13:45:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nusualabuga It doesn't have to poke fun or be mean though.  It can simply be pointing out the negative alternative.
1611358087494893570 2023-01-06 13:44:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder That's exactly what I'm talking about.
1611358025436073984 2023-01-06 13:44:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge You will :)
1611357995350519810 2023-01-06 13:44:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz True story, but this is slightly different.
1611357469317468161 2023-01-06 13:42:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom You're definitely top 1%, and I'd argue you do.  While it may not seem like it at first glance, your enemy appears to be complacency, lack of clear thinking, and anything else you push people to work against.   Doesn't have to be a person.
1611354526677716994 2023-01-06 13:30:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrismrhume It doesn't have to. It can be done in both an authentic and kind way.
1611354479525335041 2023-01-06 13:30:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sfronc Sure thing, Sebastian!
1611354416627466241 2023-01-06 13:30:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Yep. It doesn't have to be upsetting if done right.
1611354349283704832 2023-01-06 13:29:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsmarcosruiz Here's one:  https://t.co/JElqOQ5D08
1611354249216118789 2023-01-06 13:29:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai It's one of the best quotes ever on marketing.
1611354199413108738 2023-01-06 13:29:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide 100% fan. It just has to be done in a way that is authentic and kind.
1611354137345626114 2023-01-06 13:28:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel It really isn't. I'm not a mean guy.

It's often called, "throwing rocks at your enemies."  It's a growth strategy that's difficult (but works well if you get it right).  Tomorrow, I'll show 70,447 people how to do it.  ↓

1611096000747167747 2023-01-05 20:23:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheEvanBarn True as can be, Evan.  I cringe at myself from two years ago, and will cringe at this two years from now.
1611095878852579328 2023-01-05 20:22:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adamkstinson I publish almost everything I draft up.
1611095723290005504 2023-01-05 20:22:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yorudan I publish almost everything I write.
1611081410370048001 2023-01-05 19:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That content you deleted before publishing was absolutely mind-blowing to someone just getting started.
1611060368587063296 2023-01-05 18:01:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Monster thread, Dan.  You would really enjoy Adlerian Psychology if you're not familiar with it.  Keep these coming.
1611041650427428873 2023-01-05 16:47:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gary_nation Start, test, analyze, iterate, repeat.  I wish there was better advice (maybe there is) but I went b2b to b2c. Just tried as much as I could, threw away what didn't work and 2x'ed what did.
1611041380435886082 2023-01-05 16:46:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mitchell_Writes It takes a ton of self-belief and commitment to learning to do nearly anything worth doing.
1611041220297359376 2023-01-05 16:45:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesTollefson_ That's how I think about it, James.
1611041155549986818 2023-01-05 16:45:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanrush_ Anything worth doing is hard, so it's a good thing to get used to.
1611039449835573248 2023-01-05 16:38:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Absolutely, Joseph.
1611039392453230598 2023-01-05 16:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tevinkittoe 100%.
1611039373734060033 2023-01-05 16:38:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew The bare minimum. It's a numbers game and you're a spreadsheet line.
1611038643216318471 2023-01-05 16:35:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It becomes very attractive to own a business when you realize the company you work for rents your time at a significant discount.

1610995126498889730 2023-01-05 13:42:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Of course. How could I not?
1610994697849434114 2023-01-05 13:40:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austin_rief Of course. Keep showing up in my inbox each morning with great info from @MorningBrew   One of a few things I read.

1610992481835053062 2023-01-05 13:31:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy That they are. They are also great at promoting the companies they invest in.
1610992161985626113 2023-01-05 13:30:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Thanks for giving them a read, Dan. I have a feeling 2023 is your self-promotion year.
1610992075075452929 2023-01-05 13:30:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby @sweatystartup 100% this.
1610992052526895105 2023-01-05 13:30:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Yep. People are skipping the table stakes stuff.  The best way to be interesting online is to be interesting offline.
1610991889641005057 2023-01-05 13:29:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sam_starkman I think so too, Sam. Systems are important once you have the right plans in place.
1610991791360163840 2023-01-05 13:29:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collinmcooper @sweatystartup I'd agree.
1610991722871259136 2023-01-05 13:28:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheTomYoungs Love it. Thanks, Tom!

1610361019616088064 2023-01-03 19:42:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @selfientdavid But only if you'd enjoy doing it.
1610360943619473409 2023-01-03 19:42:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adamkstinson I've found the same. So many opps, so little time.
1610360871305498625 2023-01-03 19:42:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WMoneyhustler Nailed it, Myron.
1610360802514735104 2023-01-03 19:41:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danielcberk 100% it is. It's actually easier to say what you don't like doing, than what you do.
1610360704229429256 2023-01-03 19:41:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicholas_Ruest Profitability doesn't matter if you don't want to do it.
1610360640358735874 2023-01-03 19:41:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RunTheMoney @MichaelHyatt Same!
1610360601360101376 2023-01-03 19:41:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew @sivers My favorite author.
1610356620709568514 2023-01-03 19:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is about priorities.  Every time you have an idea, ask yourself:  - Does this fit into the life I'm building? - Do I really want this responsibility? - Will I be happy in 6 months?  If the answer is no to any of these, 100% skip it.
1610316392955248641 2023-01-03 16:45:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nkazhin Some people have a more automated business than I do. That's about it.
1610316181407432704 2023-01-03 16:44:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scamdemic2020 Envy isn't a bad word. Using it the incorrect way or feeling it when you shouldn't is what's bad.
1610315991992483844 2023-01-03 16:43:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanrush_ Being able to impact more people.
1610315941077975040 2023-01-03 16:43:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adamkstinson I think being able to impact more people is amazing but not at the cost.
1610315842390040576 2023-01-03 16:43:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @xBenJamminx Not much, really, to be honest. Their success is amazing and they are incredible people. But the work and responsibility that comes with it is not the trade off I'm looking for at this point in my life.
1610315698177282048 2023-01-03 16:42:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RoisinPovall It's definitely not perfect. Social media has a way of making it look a bit more that way. I'm working on it though.
1610315624789458944 2023-01-03 16:42:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NHammondDesign I fail often, but mostly get it right :)
1610315581890383872 2023-01-03 16:42:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JayMacBiz That's how I feel, Jay.
1610315532615524360 2023-01-03 16:41:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @petergyang Nah.
1610313840155103234 2023-01-03 16:35:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've met many of the top 1% of creators on Twitter and other platforms, and I rarely envy their lifestyle, team size, or obligations.
1610294240042426371 2023-01-03 15:17:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The best way to get what you want is to be crystal clear on what you don’t want.
1610271136771723273 2023-01-03 13:45:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nailingthreads I haven't really thought about it that way, tbh.
1610269253281742849 2023-01-03 13:38:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SremmLifeK Great comment, Kerry.
1610268987685994503 2023-01-03 13:36:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amaelbogne No line drawn. Be compassionate always, and always hold yourself accountable.
1610268912079216641 2023-01-03 13:36:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeJanover @RyanHoliday I've heard great things. Will pick some up this year.
1610268812233904129 2023-01-03 13:36:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje 100%. Start with why.

1610266649898131458 2023-01-03 13:27:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theleoalexandru I plan on it, Leo. Thanks!
1610266597750349831 2023-01-03 13:27:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder I think so too, Dan.
1610266561603829761 2023-01-03 13:27:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @donnelly_ceo It's good to be embarrassed. There is no other way to go from beginner to expert.
1610266494906302464 2023-01-03 13:27:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Smart addition, Jason.
1610266437284675585 2023-01-03 13:26:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Same. Plus I have some pretty direct friends (thank goodness)
1610265481637666821 2023-01-03 13:23:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I want to start writing a bit more about the mindset for solopreneurship rather than just the tactics.  If you like that, LMK in the comments and then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1610265479251206144 2023-01-03 13:23:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  1. Practice mindfulness 2. Have self-compassion 3. Seek out new experiences 4. Reflect on your values 5. Practice gratitude 6. Seek feedback 7. Practice humility 8. Seek out meaningful purpose
1610265476503830530 2023-01-03 13:23:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Seek out meaningful purpose:  Lastly, having true purpose in life helps you let go of your ego by being connected to something larger than yourself.   When you have purpose, you seek knowledge &amp; clarity.  It no longer becomes about money &amp; status, but instead about fulfillment.
1610265474373238785 2023-01-03 13:23:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Practice humility:   Nothing is cooler, IMO, than modesty.  People who overvalue their abilities &amp; opinions are a chore to be around.  So, look for opportunities to be humble with others and let go of that need to always be right.  Instead of being "right", be curious.
1610265471990878208 2023-01-03 13:23:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Seek feedback from others:   Wondering whether or not your ego is out of control? Ask a close friend.  Give them permission to be honest with you.  Make sure to actually listen to the feedback you receive, and ask them to call you out on it so you can become more aware.
1610265469876830209 2023-01-03 13:22:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Practice gratitude:   Last month, I started practicing gratitude with my wife.  At the end of each day, we say 3 things we're grateful for.  It's a humbling experience to remember how good we have it &amp; it chips away at my need to play status games.  Fewer games = less ego.
1610265467305840641 2023-01-03 13:22:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Reflect on your values:   We all get caught up in the comparison game.  More status, more money, more followers, more attention.  This is the fastest way to let your ego get blown out of proportion.  Instead, reflect on your values as a person - what do you stand for and why?
1610265464919187458 2023-01-03 13:22:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Seek out new experiences:   When you do new things, your ego notices.  Nothing helps tame an ego better than being uncomfortable in a new situation, skill, or environment.  Step outside of your comfort zone and watch yourself be humbled pretty quickly.
1610265462960537600 2023-01-03 13:22:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Cultivate self-compassion:   Be kind to yourself.  Let go of perfectionistic or self-critical thinking.   You'll feel more at ease and more open to learning and growing, rather than being driven by a need to constantly show off or prove yourself.
1610265461005946883 2023-01-03 13:22:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Practice mindfulness:   Pay attention to the present moment &amp; how you act.  Become aware of your thoughts and feelings and how your natural behaviors are often driven by your ego.  Always seeking validation? Notice it, stop, &amp; think rather than being driven by impulsive behavior.
1610265458699128833 2023-01-03 13:22:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to lose your ego:  (and improve your relationships, development, &amp; well-being)

1610001497135128579 2023-01-02 19:54:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hariscopywriter Depends on what good money means to you.
1610001442009673729 2023-01-02 19:53:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justincsimon Amazing!
1610001294172766214 2023-01-02 19:53:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WojtekRowicki It certainly will be, Wojtek.
1609995569203650581 2023-01-02 19:30:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sam_starkman Great comment, Sam.
1609995501964857347 2023-01-02 19:30:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @torreydawley It literally tells you (often - not always) who your target market and customer is better than most exercises.
1609995250897928194 2023-01-02 19:29:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @raaviratheee All good. I understand!
1609995178554675200 2023-01-02 19:28:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CalebFranzen The best way.
1609995149001560065 2023-01-02 19:28:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Incremental.
1609994231753441291 2023-01-02 19:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you've never made money working for yourself, don't build some big plan on how to make $500,000.  Instead, ask yourself, "what would I do if I needed to make $100 online in the next 24 hours?"  You probably know what you would do.   So go do that thing.
1609993312957566978 2023-01-02 19:21:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I just built something new that is automating more of my future repurposing + helping me create more content on addiitonal platforms.
1609953851972501505 2023-01-02 16:44:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Exactly. It's nice just to think through different perspectives.
1609953360303595520 2023-01-02 16:42:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz And the people we think have all the answers, are often incorrect.
1609953150856732673 2023-01-02 16:41:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jameskonn Search?
1609952960309501952 2023-01-02 16:41:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IlianDaviaud There are always outlier reasons why/why not, but in general, it's a good practice.
1609952848292511746 2023-01-02 16:40:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tommyjhback That's sort of what i do too. Good advice.
1609952758571962379 2023-01-02 16:40:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarretblaze Not a bad idea.
1609952376903045126 2023-01-02 16:38:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pereusfrance I don't explicitly disagree with "accounts" - I should have worded that better.  I won't call anyone out, but I like to have my political, philosophical, and business buttons pushed.
1609952130508505089 2023-01-02 16:37:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesTollefson_ 100%. That stuff isn't worth following, IMO.
1609951956784537600 2023-01-02 16:37:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcelwrites Same here, Marcel.
1609951934634680321 2023-01-02 16:37:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @undopamine Thanks.
1609951452763508739 2023-01-02 16:35:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One of the best ways to use Twitter is to follow accounts that you explicitly disagree with.  It takes a lot of courage to read with an open mind and find out you're occasionally 100% wrong.
1609910671071928320 2023-01-02 13:53:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thetomthorley Do something different. But make it easy on yourself to get started is all I'm saying.
1609910560887300097 2023-01-02 13:52:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmeetM @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @KateBour @SystemSunday @blakeaburge @sweatystartup @FitFounder Commented, added value, permissionless apprentice style stuff.
1609910457271214081 2023-01-02 13:52:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UsmanHSheikh You have to.
1609910368003923969 2023-01-02 13:51:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tevinkittoe Nice!
1609910335057678336 2023-01-02 13:51:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @volodarik 750,000.
1609907271751925760 2023-01-02 13:39:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill I like that.
1609906732943441921 2023-01-02 13:37:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer 1. I don't know. Some, but not much, I'd say. I Tweeted in 2018, 2019, and 2020 when I was "big" on LinkedIn and got almost nothing. I'm sure there's some though.  2. Ghostwriters don't help you improve your skill of writing, which, IMO, is an important skill to have.
1609906048889982977 2023-01-02 13:34:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom ❤️
1609905918874976257 2023-01-02 13:34:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OzolinsJanis I appreciate that, Janis.  Awesome new headshot, btw.
1609905843427852288 2023-01-02 13:33:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Love it, Leo 💪
1609905802281717763 2023-01-02 13:33:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_BrianReisman There is a ton of noise (like any platform).  It's hard finding the content that resonates, but when you do, curating the ecosystem becomes fun.
1609905503563309058 2023-01-02 13:32:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I appreciate your support, Sahil. Was great getting to know you in 2022. Big year for you again, I'm sure, in 2023.
1609905395543285762 2023-01-02 13:32:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejoshuageelen @SystemSunday It's like investing in the market. Didn't feel like much when I started, but the compounding has been nice (until 2022!)
1609905100364955650 2023-01-02 13:31:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JyotishreeDatt1 Thanks for following along. I appreciate it.
1609903940723671043 2023-01-02 13:26:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Thanks for being such a supportive part of my circle in 2022, Jay. I have a feeling we'll get to know each other even better in 2023.
1609903846016552961 2023-01-02 13:26:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday I appreciate you, Ben. Just trying to share as much as I can as often as I can.
1609903754513641477 2023-01-02 13:25:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel It's all about making a decision to give it a go for a specific period of time.
1609903651815936002 2023-01-02 13:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Absolutely, Blake. Right back at you. Big 2023's for us both I feel.
1609903506961342466 2023-01-02 13:24:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza You're welcome, Antonio. Thanks for being a customer.
1609903458949152768 2023-01-02 13:24:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @leadsstrategist Sounds like a plan though...
1609903416595054592 2023-01-02 13:24:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imMohamedKhaled Appreciate that, Mohamed.
1609903376258502656 2023-01-02 13:24:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @beast_eth Appreciate it.
1609903354909724672 2023-01-02 13:24:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @selfientdavid Thank you, David. Hope it's helpful to someone.
1609903301486678017 2023-01-02 13:23:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch Posted once more :)
1609902612534394883 2023-01-02 13:21:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it for today.  If you enjoyed this, I would be greatly appreciative if you'd:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1609902610554753024 2023-01-02 13:21:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> And that's it.  TL;DR  1/ Built publishing habit in the AM 2/ Educated my audience each PM 3/ A step-by-step thread once weekly 4/ Engage with 5-8 people in my niche each week 5/ Commented underneath large accounts 6/ Eliminated what wasn't working 7/ Setup inspiration tools
1609902608302448640 2023-01-02 13:21:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Improved My "Inspiration" Swipe File:  Writing a lot of Tweets means constantly being inspired.  Here are the tools I use to find that inspiration:  @hypefury (Tweet templates) @TwemexApp (User's best Tweets) @typeshare_co (Thread templates) @TwitterBlue (bookmark fave Tweets)
1609902605475450882 2023-01-02 13:21:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Eliminated The "Touch Base" Tweets:  By March 2022, I had a publishing habit.  So I stopped the daily, "Happy Weekday" AM posts.  They weren't adding much value.  I started writing entertaining content or 2x'ing educational Tweets, and writing more threads.
1609902601771810823 2023-01-02 13:21:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Commented Underneath Large Accounts:  One of the best ways to gain visibility here is to participate.  - Find interesting, large accounts - Set up automatic notifications - Read each of their Tweets - Add valuable comments - Engage  It's literally that easy.  https://t.co/8DGp4SOWAB
1609902592678666241 2023-01-02 13:21:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Engaged With 6-10 Interesting People Each Week:  I made it a habit to build connections.  Here are some smart folks I've jammed out with:  @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @TheDanKoe @dickiebush @KateBour @SystemSunday @blakeaburge @sweatystartup @FitFounder  It's called "social" media
1609902585330139137 2023-01-02 13:21:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Wrote A Step-By-Step Thread 1x Per Week:  Weekly threads powered my growth.  I gained thousands of followers by sharing detailed threads.  My goal is to walk someone step-by-step through something critical in solopreneurship.
1609902582578675712 2023-01-02 13:21:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Shared Educational Tweets Each PM:  Each afternoon, I shared a lesson from my solopreneur journey.  Topics included:  - Audience growth - Service businesses - Building info products - Using social media effectively  I pretend I'm writing to help ONE person.
1609902579961528321 2023-01-02 13:21:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I Built My Publishing Habit Each AM:  In October of 2021, I committed to publishing daily on Twitter.  That carried into 2022.  I started with a "Happy {Day} to X" Tweet each AM.  I had 2 goals:  1. Continue my Tweeting habit. 2. Put my name &amp; face in front of people daily.
1609902577663070208 2023-01-02 13:20:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How I added 256,700+ new Twitter followers in 2022:

1609653763299737607 2023-01-01 20:52:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AustinLinney That includes replies (like this one). Usually just 2x.
1609653628368818180 2023-01-01 20:51:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejoshuageelen It 100% does. I promise.
1609653539571367937 2023-01-01 20:51:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BuildToFreedom More surprised than flexing, but I get it.
1609653436366176262 2023-01-01 20:50:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ProcureBites Thanks, Tom!
1609652975076532227 2023-01-01 20:49:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In December, my Tweets were seen by more people than the population of Canada.  Twitter is absolutely wild.  https://t.co/QJGC7nkPk6
1609636970657116163 2023-01-01 19:45:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Work on myself. Take notes. Share them.

1609615830005813249 2023-01-01 18:21:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge This is awesome, Blake. Perfect timing as I was trying to build this in Notion.

1609229691847598081 2022-12-31 16:47:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd It's one of the best things I've read.
1609229658632949761 2022-12-31 16:47:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @emmettkaimusic Of course! Keep doing your thing.

1609228211778457607 2022-12-31 16:41:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Great lessons, Matt!
1609199907788685318 2022-12-31 14:48:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Really bringing the heat EOY Dickie. 🔥

1609179752337637382 2022-12-31 13:28:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland @KateBour It's such a good book. 2022 was a weird, wild, and wonderful year.
1609178555308560384 2022-12-31 13:23:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd @TheToolsBook I ordered it and am looking fwd to reading it.
1609177927735705605 2022-12-31 13:21:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @milanicreative Already ordered :)
1609177689541206018 2022-12-31 13:20:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Thanks, Joseph!
1609177640635596802 2022-12-31 13:20:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge @KateBour She's a phenomenal follow.
1609177268156354568 2022-12-31 13:18:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder @KateBour Read the piece by Marshall if you have time. Probably my favorite.
1609177207628234755 2022-12-31 13:18:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessedanyusufco @jackbutcher Same.
1609177185272692737 2022-12-31 13:18:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It was awesome.
1609177026845343747 2022-12-31 13:17:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Great timing for the new year.  You should link up with my wife at some point. She talks about finances daily with her audience.
1609175697309704197 2022-12-31 13:12:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheToolsBook That's it for today.  If you enjoyed this, I would be greatly appreciative if you'd:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1609175694457683968 2022-12-31 13:12:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 11. Stutz  Who: Jonah Hill &amp; @TheToolsBook   This was my favorite documentary of the year.  I enjoyed the transparency and honesty and found Phil Stutz to be a compelling storyteller, teacher, and therapist.   https://t.co/mXWWHsfsjM
1609175692142329857 2022-12-31 13:12:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10. Life Can Be Pretty Cruel  Who: @sjdelagarde   It's just worth reading.  The key line: we don’t realise how strong we are until we have no choice. We are so much stronger than we think we are. You too.   https://t.co/qldG0h8UoD
1609175690057850880 2022-12-31 13:12:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9. Freak Pop Novelty  Who: @emmettkaimusic  While the album came out in 2020, it was easily my favorite listen of 2022.  It clocks in at just 7 songs &amp; 28 minutes, but it's a top 10 album of all time for me.  It powered our drive from TN to NY this year.   https://t.co/Qkw4BAkTdK
1609175687658721280 2022-12-31 13:12:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nytdavidbrooks 8. How @TrungTPhan grew his Twitter following by 300k  Who: @jakobgreenfeld   Simply an incredible breakdown by Jakob. The time he put into dissecting Trung's growth was a really great read.  Not to be missed.
1609175685452423171 2022-12-31 13:12:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7. The Second Mountain  Who: @nytdavidbrooks  The Second Mountain was my favorite read this year.   It helped me continue down the path of joy from purpose rather than fleeting moments of happiness.   https://t.co/srBPwmXr1V
1609175682814287879 2022-12-31 13:12:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harrymack 6. How To Not Start Over And Over Again  Who: @jackbutcher  This was a Tweet you could have missed, but to me, it packs in an incredible amount of knowledge.  The importance of naming and brand/phrase/idea equity is often missed.
1609175680461283330 2022-12-31 13:12:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5. Guerilla Bars 25  Who: @harrymack  Harry Mack has long been my favorite creator. A guy who is literally the best in the world at what he does, and always getting better.  I could have picked any of his Omegle bars as well.    https://t.co/MOF8QHbeyc
1609175677927825409 2022-12-31 13:12:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarshallKarp 4. How we turbo-charged our newsletter subscribers  Who: @KateBour   This great thread from Katelyn has been instrumental in growing my newsletter and how I think about growth in 2023.
1609175675553841152 2022-12-31 13:12:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. What is the single insight that most changed your life?  Who: @MarshallKarp  This is probably my favorite article I read in 2022.  Marshall is a NYT best-selling author and very good friend of mine here in The Hudson Valley.   I highly recommend it.   https://t.co/VmxvP9Wost
1609175673150504961 2022-12-31 13:12:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MillyTamati 2. How The Hustle Sold Their First Ads:  Who: @thesamparr   How to hustle and get creative to sell your first ads. Cool read and even cooler to share with us.
1609175665961467904 2022-12-31 13:12:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Why Communities Will Fail (and how to succeed):  Who: @MillyTamati   Without intentional community design, 9/10 communities will fail.  I agree.
1609175663428206593 2022-12-31 13:12:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The 11 best things I read, saw, or listened to in 2022:
1609173919600107522 2022-12-31 13:05:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Amazing, Matt.  Short, concise, and filled with actionable tips.  Instant bookmark. Have a great NYE, my friend.

1608880157137448960 2022-12-30 17:38:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JulesEvans11 There's definitely burnout.
1608880069161914370 2022-12-30 17:37:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BretMagpiong He's an insanely talented sales leader who is now looking to build something of his own.
1608868839110107138 2022-12-30 16:53:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess You always must have choices, Marcus.
1608868650727124992 2022-12-30 16:52:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanrush_ Exactly.
1608868593579753472 2022-12-30 16:52:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thebillymassie Great quote.
1608864294036279297 2022-12-30 16:35:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My buddy worked 60 hours a week for 8 years, burned out, and eventually found himself on the brink of mental exhaustion only to get laid off because his company needed to free up a few extra bucks.  Please build leverage in 2023 by laying your foundation for Solopreneurship.
1608859239627509760 2022-12-30 16:15:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Really nice recap, my man.  2023 is the year we meet up in person. Let's make it happen?
1608818027126198272 2022-12-30 13:31:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @phmoty Whoops :)
1608817087279161345 2022-12-30 13:27:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thanks. I'm really pumped to send this one.
1608816591982190593 2022-12-30 13:25:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thank you brother. I owe you an email. Will send that today.
1608816549149937671 2022-12-30 13:25:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamanthaPostman That's the best compliment I could receive.
1608816486663217154 2022-12-30 13:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder It won't go too deep on that, but let's grab some time to talk about it.  Lots of good tips on making it an awesome launch.  I'll email you later today.
1608816258807660545 2022-12-30 13:24:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Looking fwd to sending it out, Danny.
1608816130965270532 2022-12-30 13:23:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachRizwani Appreciate that.
1608815911804506113 2022-12-30 13:22:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MatthewBaltzell Appreciate it, Matthew,
1608815868112437249 2022-12-30 13:22:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje See you there, man!
1608815247103500288 2022-12-30 13:20:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6 Growth Lessons I Learned In 2023 (and how you can use them) coming tomorrow morning at 9:00a EST:   https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG

1608812770996391936 2022-12-30 13:10:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heydannymiranda Congrats, man.  You're a GREAT interviewer. Really enjoyed the time, Danny.   Keep going.
1608807746505428995 2022-12-30 12:50:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copywithkush Love this breakdown. Thanks, Kushagra!
1608569909738614791 2022-12-29 21:05:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cj_legendaring @canva @TwemexApp Very cool!
1608547604912128003 2022-12-29 19:36:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nickmiller888 I think it's more than that.  There are a lot of folks Tweeting for years and can't build an audience.  It's consistency, yes. But also your writing/communication skills, analysis, improvement, storytelling, customer understanding, etc.
1608547312506376192 2022-12-29 19:35:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YongSooChung You said it better than me :)
1608545733656952834 2022-12-29 19:29:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Exactly, Danny. Too many people releasing courses with 8 followers.
1608545600919998469 2022-12-29 19:28:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathancolossus That's the right approach, IMO.
1608545561329926145 2022-12-29 19:28:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sam_starkman Smart moves, Sam.
1608545259814019072 2022-12-29 19:27:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThorKopala True story.  But audience and distribution is almost always a key part.
1608544691972079616 2022-12-29 19:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Making money is great – but the best solopreneurs realize that money is an outcome of audience and distribution.  Focus on that.   The money will likely come.
1608536853854162947 2022-12-29 18:54:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I need to unplug badly.  You're a better man than I am 😂

1608507966554243072 2022-12-29 16:59:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @anthony_astbury Fear + lack of confidence + inability to take action.
1608507862422290433 2022-12-29 16:58:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @leadtheprdct You have to treat the open market much differently.  Listen to your audience/customers, experiment, analyze, pivot.  Keep building skills, learn to market, etc.   It;s much harder, but worth ir.
1608501908322353155 2022-12-29 16:35:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you work a 9 to 5, you have professional skills.  In 2023, try taking those skills to the open market.  Sure, you'll have to make some noise and attract customers, but you'll charge 5x more than what you make at work.
1608492177394475010 2022-12-29 15:56:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe This is brilliant bud. Well constructed.
1608466549106524160 2022-12-29 14:14:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ The reading will take 5 minutes, but true mastery will take years. Community is so hard. You've obviously cracked the code, Matt.
1608460976894144512 2022-12-29 13:52:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Thank you, my friend.
1608458860863557632 2022-12-29 13:44:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SteveOnSpeed Thank you, man. Appreciate the love here.
1608457720046260228 2022-12-29 13:39:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PranicPhysician For this, a piece of LinkedIn content.   But, I've also used it in email and on LPs.
1608457232664125442 2022-12-29 13:37:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Thanks, man. You're writing is so good, I'm not sure you need it.
1608457099251486721 2022-12-29 13:37:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom That's funny. I knew it existed but didn't really start understanding how to work it until about 3 years ago.
1608456175166562304 2022-12-29 13:33:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RunTheMoney  https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE
1608455484176240642 2022-12-29 13:30:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregonpurpose For sure. there is no "right" way to be an Entrepreneur.   I make my case daily for why I chose my path, but there are likely hundreds or thousands of alternative paths.
1608455231423004679 2022-12-29 13:29:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shrawanrajkc Really effective.
1608455197998649344 2022-12-29 13:29:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lamaandesign  https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE
1608454847623499779 2022-12-29 13:28:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Same. I love this little tweak, too.
1608454619335622656 2022-12-29 13:27:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WardensWisdom 100%. Gotta paint that picture.
1608454528864591875 2022-12-29 13:26:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Wow. Haha. Damn - sorry man :)
1608454471155171328 2022-12-29 13:26:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thanks, Blake!
1608454430428467200 2022-12-29 13:26:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ModernManHQ Try it out.
1608454405694656513 2022-12-29 13:26:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexxroy I love frameworks for writing. Makes everything easier.
1608454338397241346 2022-12-29 13:26:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sam_starkman Exactly.
1608454269702754307 2022-12-29 13:25:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mralabden Just observe what's going on in your life each day.   Do a 10-minute brain dump.  Or scroll your favorite YouTube, Twitter folks for inspiration.
1608453546378240000 2022-12-29 13:23:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it for today.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1608453544453046273 2022-12-29 13:23:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  - Pain - Agitate - Intrigue - Positive future - Solution
1608453542376775682 2022-12-29 13:23:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Results:  - 276,798 impressions - 1,646 engagements - 371 comments  And 700+ new subscribers to my newsletter (nice).
1608453539650576386 2022-12-29 13:23:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Present Your Solution:  The last step is to introduce our solution into the equation.   In this particular instance, the solution was my newsletter, and my intention was to drive subscribers.   You can see that here:  https://t.co/ZjJPzoRo17
1608453532927008769 2022-12-29 13:23:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Paint A Positive Future:  Now that we have the audience's attention, I work to paint a picture of what a positive future would look like.  A positive future tied to following the intriguing Creator Funnel.  Here's how I wrote that out:  https://t.co/wYXkBYRoen
1608453526144929793 2022-12-29 13:22:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Introduce Something Intriguing:  Next, I introduce something intriguing.  I want the audience to think, "Wait, what's that?"  So in this post, I introduce something called the Creator Funnel.  My goal is to get them to lean in with interest to carry them through the content.  https://t.co/G111Treuyt
1608453518683160576 2022-12-29 13:22:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Agitate The Pain:  Next, we're going to turn the knife. Make it hurt a bit.  This gets under the reader's skin and makes them...well...agitated.  Once someone is agitated, they are much more likely to be open to a solution.  Here's how I went from problem to agitation:  https://t.co/3llQthpa8J
1608453512270077953 2022-12-29 13:22:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Highlight Something Painful:  The 1st line highlights a painful problem that people in my audience experience:  They feel taken advantage of at work.  This line is intended to do 2 things:  1. Elicit a strong emotional response 2. Get the reader to the next line  https://t.co/9M3780c6JZ
1608453505668218880 2022-12-29 13:22:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This is my variation of a popular copywriting formula called PAS (problem/agitate/solution).  I add 2 steps to make it PAIPS:  - Problem - Agitate - Intrigue - Positive Future - Solution  I'll break down a piece of my content that had 276k impressions using this format.
1608453503608885249 2022-12-29 13:22:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Improve your copywriting with this 5-step formula:

1608228893001158656 2022-12-28 22:30:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Build the habit using prompts.  Also, I've been using ChatGPT to help suggest interesting things to write about. Super easy.
1608195551228760065 2022-12-28 20:17:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thePhilRivers Yeah, that's probably true.
1608195414666403840 2022-12-28 20:17:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ilovemarichelle I don't. I'm not sure anyone does.  So take small ones and fail fast.
1608195342893195267 2022-12-28 20:17:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjankoch I don't really use any, to be honest. I've been a "gut feel" guy my whole life. No joke.
1608182310964273153 2022-12-28 19:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It feels like 90% of being a Solopreneur is taking small but uncomfortable risks constantly.

1608176496430178305 2022-12-28 19:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessedanyusufco @thedankoe Dan is a wonderful business person and all-around great guy. Glad to have my name in there with his.
1608147118916517889 2022-12-28 17:05:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregonpurpose I'm familiar with it but haven't read through it fully.
1608146925404012550 2022-12-28 17:04:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Appreciate that, man.
1608146810538688515 2022-12-28 17:04:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @janekminarik It's not if you understand it.  Many people see it as a risk.
1608146703215104001 2022-12-28 17:03:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sam7rs I agree with this.
1608146614421536770 2022-12-28 17:03:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lincolnpolson Radical accountability is a term I like.
1608146519776976896 2022-12-28 17:03:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JayMacBiz 100%, Jay.
1608146478173675523 2022-12-28 17:02:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffperez_jr Same here. Only choice.
1608139528992182276 2022-12-28 16:35:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> An upside of Solopreneurship is being owned by nobody.  No investors, no board, no boss, &amp; no banks.  The downside is that if you fail, you're 100% responsible (and many people have spent their lives blaming others for failures)  If you can accept that, you should play the game.
1608100488972492801 2022-12-28 14:00:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabe_llewellyn @FitFounder Not in a million years.
1608099886695682049 2022-12-28 13:57:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aidanlyon @thysroes There are lots of one-person businesses:  - Courses - Coaching - Community - Advising/Consulting - Design - Copywriting - UX/UI  Lots and lots.
1608099497305079812 2022-12-28 13:56:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It's difficult (although not impossible) to analyze &amp; improve most things in your life if you're chained to a paycheck.  Companies are pushing people to the brink, and then your reward is a layoff when the math doesn't work.  I hate that.
1608098906889687041 2022-12-28 13:53:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Like most things, hustle gets pulled to the extreme by both sides:   Hustle 24/7 vs. Anti-hustle  The truth is, sometimes you gotta hustle and sometimes you need to rest.  "Everything in moderation." - My Mother
1608098421499461637 2022-12-28 13:51:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx 4.9B people with an internet connection and most people need 2 clients to leave their job.  I like that math.
1608097125404925954 2022-12-28 13:46:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Same. Cut my pay by 50%. I don't care. This is the best life.
1608096981448105985 2022-12-28 13:46:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ I love watching you get after it, KP. Keep it going in 2023 my friend.
1608096852800593921 2022-12-28 13:45:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Thanks for the shout, Greg.  I think 2023 will be the year that top-performers realize the internet provides them with a ton of options.  Solopreneurship will become increasingly more common.
1608094939157778432 2022-12-28 13:38:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Same. Money is the outcome of working on what I enjoy.
1608094778775699456 2022-12-28 13:37:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Same here. Eliminated coaching and advising. Taking no more than 2 meetings per week with people I actually want to talk to.
1608094617995513857 2022-12-28 13:36:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Yep. That's it right there.
1608094111021629441 2022-12-28 13:34:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Great thread, Ben, and appreciate the shout for the hook :)
1608092540485472257 2022-12-28 13:28:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HellloHar Go to Mexico City with 2 of my closest friends.  Walk 15,000+ steps per day.  Have breakfast every Sunday morning with my wife.
1608092355521052674 2022-12-28 13:27:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo You're crushing it, Easlo. Solopreneurship is the right game for you.
1608092267625029633 2022-12-28 13:27:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Same here.
1608090649345114113 2022-12-28 13:21:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @donnelly_ceo Same.
1608090626251231233 2022-12-28 13:20:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ethan_Mick Yep. Very challenging. But not as challenging as renting out our time forever.
1608089943212965889 2022-12-28 13:18:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship isn't about disrupting an industry, building the next unicorn, or being featured on some Forbes list.  It's about doing things you enjoy, with people you enjoy, and doing very little of what you don't like.  Anti-Maximization is the mantra.

1607818276100538368 2022-12-27 19:18:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanaprice This is definitely true.
1607818241778528257 2022-12-27 19:18:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrGarCla Definitely. It's already helping me.
1607818157124902912 2022-12-27 19:18:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessedanyusufco I hope so, Jesse.
1607818085980930048 2022-12-27 19:17:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hesbythesea The best teacher is action, I promise.
1607818047913594880 2022-12-27 19:17:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattvvolf Tryin!
1607817697483431936 2022-12-27 19:16:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2023 Prediction:  More high performers will view one-person internet businesses as a viable option alternative to traditional work.  More flexibility, high income potential, 100% ownership, &amp; the ability to be present for their partner and children.  We're just getting started.
1607790727953514497 2022-12-27 17:29:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @okeymangesh @NealOGrady I have not.  I have a few affiliates running ads, which I need to figure out how to disable.
1607790027253362688 2022-12-27 17:26:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NealOGrady @FreeSites_com They need to make this into a template.

1607744624382332928 2022-12-27 14:26:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom This is so smart. More stuff to add to my routine. Love it.
1607729312307843080 2022-12-27 13:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Thank you, Jason!
1607729176055894018 2022-12-27 13:24:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai @SahilBloom He's a smart guy, that Sahil.
1607728977984061440 2022-12-27 13:23:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Thank you, my man. Appreciate that.
1607728847285362689 2022-12-27 13:23:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ant_carlton I still am too at times. But working through it.
1607728787138945024 2022-12-27 13:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisLaubWrites Yep. If you can't figure that out, it's tough to fix.
1607728705761312768 2022-12-27 13:22:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder It's that momentum on tasks that really changes things.
1607728611154354178 2022-12-27 13:22:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Damn, that's funny 😂
1607728557442347008 2022-12-27 13:22:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sam_starkman Love that, Sam. Great formula.
1607727451571949568 2022-12-27 13:17:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it for today.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1607727449336340480 2022-12-27 13:17:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> As you complete your tasks, you move closer to your goals.  As you reach your goals, you become even more rigid in how you spend your time.  When you become rigid about how you spend your time, you stop procrastinating.  Congrats. You've done it.
1607727446790471680 2022-12-27 13:17:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Use Time-Management Techniques:  Get yourself a Pomodoro Timer.  After being recommended to me multiple times, I finally bought one.  25 minutes of deep task completion followed by a 5-minute break.
1607727444303249411 2022-12-27 13:17:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Get Organized:  If possible, sit down at a clean desk in a minimal workspace.  Get rid of unnecessary piles of junk, snacks, or messy papers.  Just your computer, the tools you need to complete your tasks, and maybe a cup of coffee or espresso (if you're like me).
1607727442298372096 2022-12-27 13:17:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Eliminate Distractions:  Put your phone and computer on Do Not Disturb mode.  Get rid of all push notifications while you're at it.  Close all social media tabs.  Shut the door to your office, throw on headphones, and lo-fi beats (or white noise).  This is your Zen time.
1607727440071213056 2022-12-27 13:17:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create A Schedule (and Stick To It):  Everyone has times of day when they are more productive than others.   Figure out when you are most creative &amp; schedule your tasks for those times.  Create a recurring invite and include links to the tools you'll use during that block.
1607727437709721601 2022-12-27 13:17:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Break Down Goals Into Small Tasks:  Big goals can be overwhelming.  Small tasks make things much easier.  For example, getting 100 newsletter subscribers might feel daunting to some people.  But if you can think of a way to attract 4 per day, you'll get there in one month.
1607727431334469632 2022-12-27 13:17:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Set SMART Goals:  - Specific: What, specifically, do I want to accomplish?  - Measurable: Quantify what success looks like.  - Achievable: Is this reasonable?  - Relevant: Why am I setting this goal?  - Time-bound: What's my time horizon to finish?
1607727428788539394 2022-12-27 13:17:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Start By Identifying the Root Cause:  There's a reason you're putting things off.  It could be a lack of motivation, no clear goals, no resources, or missing confidence.   You need to start by being honest with yourself so you can figure it out, and address it directly.
1607727421901398016 2022-12-27 13:17:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to stop procrastinating (for good):
1607722895853207553 2022-12-27 12:59:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Just instituted a week-long plan for 2023, starting next Monday.  Really interested to see how it goes for me. Good stuff, Dan.
1607681038653837313 2022-12-27 10:13:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer Awesome thread, Chris.  Appreciate the shout, man!

1607457519366012929 2022-12-26 19:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The smartest people I know are building leverage by focusing nearly 100% on audience, community, and distribution in 2023.

1607414754313641984 2022-12-26 16:35:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's amazing how many people unlock generational wealth because they believe in an idea, start working on it, and don't stop.
1607368371825217536 2022-12-26 13:30:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Publish, publish, publish. Watch 2023 be a more interesting year.
1607366929693523968 2022-12-26 13:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In 2023, even if you’re employed full-time you can still:  - Consult - Freelance - Write eBooks - Create video courses - Write a paid newsletter - Do cohort-based coaching  The barrier to entry has never been lower.  The potential to replace your salary has never been higher.
1607348807204749312 2022-12-26 12:13:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MasculineMind_ Appreciate the mention ❤️
1607107625392672768 2022-12-25 20:14:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher Happy Holidays, Butcher fam.

1606662568130617345 2022-12-24 14:46:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Dude - Notion pages? Love this addition. Jumping into the travel one now. 🔥
1606653282696499202 2022-12-24 14:09:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Thank you for the inclusion, my friend.
1606651422140923905 2022-12-24 14:02:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge I need a Google sheet that stops me from eating hamburgers in 2023.
1606649756595486721 2022-12-24 13:55:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_adamno It's short for elliptical.  In college, I used the elliptical each morning (I can't run, have 2 back surgeries) and the machine brand was EFX.  So, I've just always called it that.
1606647836111773698 2022-12-24 13:47:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Dominant recap. Immediate bookmark.  Have a great Holiday, Sahil.
1606643350311936006 2022-12-24 13:29:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkShust @NotionHQ Turns out there is no Carol in HR.
1606643180363026433 2022-12-24 13:29:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ygorduraes I'll check it out!
1606642999668113408 2022-12-24 13:28:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide I think just getting organized in something (could be Notion or Google Drive or whatever) is critical. Then, have a system for content.  Nail those 2 and you're off to a good start, IMO.
1606642161922936832 2022-12-24 13:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omgitsinfy Thank you!
1606642106675728387 2022-12-24 13:25:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvanThomson01 Thanks, Evan!
1606642055677100032 2022-12-24 13:24:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge I've finally gotten good at this. It's taken a decade, dude.
1606641975192698880 2022-12-24 13:24:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel It's the best distro system I've read about,
1606640995004583938 2022-12-24 13:20:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I feel the same way, funny enough. I know I can get better.
1606640418363424769 2022-12-24 13:18:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1606640415578460162 2022-12-24 13:18:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Virtual Assistant System:  Last year, I brought on VA to help reduce noise during my weekday.  She was absolutely amazing and saved me nearly 40 hours per month.  (She left Zirtual in 2022 unfortunately - will hire anew in 2023)  Here was our system for working together:
1606640412109807616 2022-12-24 13:18:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Networking System:  Keeping up with people isn't easy.  Sure, my best friends &amp; I talk weekly.   But I want to touch base (and support) others I've gotten to know. So, I created a quarterly reminder.  Every 13 weeks, I reach out to 20+ people to see if I can help in some way.  https://t.co/XTI0JcOpWA
1606640403863699458 2022-12-24 13:18:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Content Promotion System:  If you write once, you should promote twice.  Part of my 2023 plan is to install a best-in-class promotion system for my business.  I'm going to start by following this one from @harrydry at MarketingExamples:   https://t.co/YmgFZPq1HS
1606640401888190464 2022-12-24 13:18:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Content Creation System:  I use a 4-step content creation system to produce rapidly:  - Step 1: Curate - Step 2: Create - Step 3: Templatize - Step 4: Distribute  I use a combination of @TwemexApp + @SaveToNotion + @hypefury to execute on the plan.
1606640398440488967 2022-12-24 13:18:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Time Blocking System:  GCal + Calendly makes sure I never book something in the wrong spot.  - Mornings: Workout &amp; Engagement on social - Early afternoon: Creativity and writing - Late afternoon: coaching &amp; meetings  I set up custom availability for everything.  https://t.co/zofyOXSapU
1606640380476358656 2022-12-24 13:18:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Knowledge Management System:  Everything you know or need to reference should be stored in one place.  I use @NotionHQ as my personal knowledge management system:  - Business plan - Weekly to-do - Course roadmap - Business workflow - Process documents  All in one place.  https://t.co/wiQ5qKpZz3
1606640369772412928 2022-12-24 13:18:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My 7-figure, one-person business is run entirely on systems.  Here are the 6 most important ones I use:  (Feel free to steal, replicate, and use for your business.)

1606367484424093702 2022-12-23 19:13:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Stack small skills on top of one another. Regardless of whether you are a novice or a pro at any of these, just start becoming 1% at each.
1606332919491883008 2022-12-23 16:56:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ishverduzco Yes please.
1606327592809799687 2022-12-23 16:35:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> No matter who you work for, you should act like you work for yourself.  Because nobody will hold you more accountable than you.
1606303803225030657 2022-12-23 15:00:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl This person seems to be taking an, “everyone else said this was easy and turns out it wasn’t” approach and therefore they are at fault.   Rather than, “here’s what I learned and here is what I might do differently next time” approach  Not trying to be callous. Just worth noting.
1606299373989597184 2022-12-23 14:43:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It's amazing how much my "luck" has changed by publishing my core beliefs to anyone who will listen.
1606297628588838912 2022-12-23 14:36:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore Congrats, Ed!
1606282344863760385 2022-12-23 13:35:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thestorystylist Thank you so much
1606280488863178752 2022-12-23 13:28:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I started thinking about anti-goals when I came across your piece and Andrew Wilkinson's piece. Had never considered them.
1606280031965061120 2022-12-23 13:26:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Cheers, Danny!
1606279989019561990 2022-12-23 13:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l Amazing, Shushant!
1606279595438837760 2022-12-23 13:24:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Haha. Thanks, Jason!
1606279562907615232 2022-12-23 13:24:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @callmehouck Super important and relatively easy.

1606278840036245505 2022-12-23 13:21:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In 2022 I stopped doing nearly everything I hated doing.  Not surprisingly, it was my most successful &amp; enjoyable year ever.  I did it by setting "anti-goals" in 2021.  Tomorrow, I'll show 67,200+ people how to set them so 2023 is the best year of their lives.  Join us below ↓

1606007994541555714 2022-12-22 19:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One of the biggest Twitter hacks I've found is to be a genuinely nice person and root for other people to succeed.   The bar is pretty damn low around here sometimes.
1605970763630067713 2022-12-22 16:57:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Victortmanrique Calling myself out.
1605970722060320775 2022-12-22 16:57:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Reid_HFC Same.
1605970639692578816 2022-12-22 16:56:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @verocopyco I got myself.
1605970558771871748 2022-12-22 16:56:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tariquesha1 Haha. It's not. But I try and make the explanation simple.
1605965260787154946 2022-12-22 16:35:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm not sure who needs to hear this, but you're probably overcomplicating it.

1605923706449952768 2022-12-22 13:50:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jordvandenhooff @SahilBloom I actually pay $15,600 (did my math before coffee).  It could be pre-existing conditions (I have 2 back surgeries + a medical issue) plus my wife, and I opted for a premium insurance product.
1605922910480306177 2022-12-22 13:47:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Smart man, Dan. That's the phased approach.
1605918166596698112 2022-12-22 13:28:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Keep giving it a shot!
1605918114616573954 2022-12-22 13:28:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DaveMeier @ItsKieranDrew 100%. It's extremely hard.  But everyone should at least consider it if they have strong confidence and ability.
1605917927466708992 2022-12-22 13:27:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theleoalexandru Cool, thank you! I appreciate that.
1605917573165420546 2022-12-22 13:26:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ I'll check it out!
1605917444027056128 2022-12-22 13:25:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza Yep. I chose that word very carefully.
1605917147359739907 2022-12-22 13:24:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ant_carlton I think it's a smart move. I think you should replace 60 to 70% of your income and then jump.
1605917065939935233 2022-12-22 13:23:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theleoalexandru I write about that all of the time, and agree.
1605916878676918273 2022-12-22 13:23:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue That's a good place to be :)
1605916762071072770 2022-12-22 13:22:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @careyourpresent Build up your business first. Then leave.
1605916674317754369 2022-12-22 13:22:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sam_starkman That's great. Work to replace 60%-70% of your salary and then GO.
1605916585323003907 2022-12-22 13:22:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I was just talking about this, this morning with my Mother. I pay over $24,000 per year in health insurance. It's ridiculous.
1605916307349807105 2022-12-22 13:20:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Smart. With this much competition, it's still the best time because it's only getting more competitive.
1605916214479400961 2022-12-22 13:20:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets I had somewhere between 3 to 6 months runway. That was certainly helpful. I also had started before I quit.
1605916103326126081 2022-12-22 13:20:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I hope so too, man.
1605915396363673603 2022-12-22 13:17:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1605915394002272257 2022-12-22 13:17:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Regret:  Don't look back in 10 years and wish you got started earlier.  Could you fail? Absolutely. Will you make mistakes? 100%  Will you recover and always be able to find a job again if you're talented? Definitely.  At least give it a shot in 2023.  I'm rooting for you.
1605915391099797504 2022-12-22 13:17:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Joy:  We all think we want happiness, but what we really want is joy.  Happiness is fleeting moments. Joy means making an important impact during our lives.  By betting on yourself and aligning with a higher purpose, you give yourself the best shot of living a joyful life.
1605915388746911749 2022-12-22 13:17:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Purpose:  When you were growing up, did you dream of sitting in a cubicle &amp; talking to customers about some random integrated multi-platform functionality that will probably fail to IPO?  No.  Instead, choose an obsession and go find people who need what you're selling.
1605915386565824512 2022-12-22 13:17:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Flexibility:  Want to take Johnny on a fishing trip?  Want to accompany your aging parents to Japan for their dream vacation?  No more "Damn, my boss says no" while telling your friends about the great work/life balance at your company.  Say yes to everything that matters.
1605915384372232193 2022-12-22 13:17:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Leverage:  If you build a successful online business, you create incredible leverage.  You become harder to control. You can say no more. You can take time when you want.  You control the effort and how big you want to go.  You're the decision-maker.
1605915377552310272 2022-12-22 13:17:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Loyalty:  In case you've missed it, companies are laying folks off at a pretty rapid pace.  Newsflash: You're a line on a spreadsheet until the math doesn't work out.  The days of 30+ year careers at companies are over.  Employ yourself and you'll get the boss you deserve.
1605915370556166147 2022-12-22 13:17:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your Time:  Time moved slowly when I was a kid.  A little faster in my 20's. Then?  Bang. I'm 41.  I can't imagine spending the prime of my life missing my wife, not being able to explore the world or see my parents before they are gone.
1605915367905312769 2022-12-22 13:17:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your family:  Your spouse/partner is getting older and your kids are growing up fast.  Are you going to be happy that you spent more time at the office, or built a business where you can spend the majority of your time with your loved ones?
1605915365724131328 2022-12-22 13:17:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your health:  During the pandemic, many people got significantly less healthy.  Now, we're back at work and also trying to play catch up on our health.  That's not a fun game to play.  Take 12 months and zoom in on your health with more free time.
1605915358489186304 2022-12-22 13:17:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Internet:  There has never been a better time to start an internet business.  You have access to 4.9B potential customers.  Break your current earnings into weekly chunks.  Can you find enough people to pay you each week for your knowledge or services?  Likely yes.
1605915356316536832 2022-12-22 13:17:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Why you should consider quitting your job in 2023:
1605915196463009793 2022-12-22 13:16:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Never gotten into Reddit.  What's your Reddit fave community, Matt?

1605645592377626634 2022-12-21 19:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If your boss can make you cancel your planned vacation, please don't tell me about your work/life balance.
1605604074480599041 2022-12-21 16:40:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vdanielpinto When your intentions are bad from the beginning, there is no right way.
1605603971103543303 2022-12-21 16:39:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @piros_eth Or stop acting.
1605603913276674250 2022-12-21 16:39:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamierusso Badges of honor (figuratively).
1605602810187468802 2022-12-21 16:35:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> For solopreneurs it pays to act fast, make mistakes, and never stop iterating.  Go fast. Be wrong. Fix it. Repeat.
1605590634638610433 2022-12-21 15:46:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_lambert Sharing your unique journey rather than regurgitated best practices.
1605590482599510016 2022-12-21 15:46:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sgrubb34 @justinwelsh Thank you brother,
1605590040058347521 2022-12-21 15:44:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thetomthorley Looks like a damn nice background, Tom. Thanks for the video.
1605571943914037248 2022-12-21 14:32:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Great thoughts, Matt. 💡
1605563506320846848 2022-12-21 13:59:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Most of the people I know who learn effectively, learn by doing. There is nothing better than playing basketball to learn how to play basketball. But we often take such an opposite approach. Knowledge gathering forever and never taking action.
1605554987328839681 2022-12-21 13:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> As a solopreneur, you are the product.  Your success depends on how good you are at selling, networking, and making yourself unforgettable.  Your goal is to authentically express your journey, values and personality and then find an audience that resonates with it.
1605340386569789440 2022-12-20 23:12:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chase_arbeiter @dickiebush @matt_gray_ @ItsKieranDrew @thedankoe @SahilBloom @FitFounder Thanks, Chase!
1605288109146624014 2022-12-20 19:44:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 #3 is a ton of fun.  I've been taking cooking classes and wine classes in every country I travel to.
1605287273825980416 2022-12-20 19:41:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaronhayslip True story.
1605287203143393280 2022-12-20 19:41:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nik_Atanackovic I wouldn't say it's a massive differentiator.
1605283217912877060 2022-12-20 19:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Networking 101  When you reach out to busy people, assume you are 1 of 1,000+ people asking for their time.  - Differentiate yourself. - Make your ask mutually beneficial. - Make it really, really easy to say yes.  Do these 3 things and you'll network more productively.

1605255851480125441 2022-12-20 17:36:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TomBeemSays @LeeviEerola @rsinstantly @nils100km @raulkaevand @alxberman @janvmusscher Congrats man!
1605240431016644613 2022-12-20 16:35:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone wants to be successful and wealthy, but nobody wants to get out of their comfort zone.  So, move to that place, start that business, publish that content, and send that cold email.  Where dreaming fails, action usually succeeds.
1605229345479557127 2022-12-20 15:51:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamie_maguire1 @robertgriker This is how I started and what I recommend.   Service business first. Raise rates over time as you hone in on best fit customers.   Over time, package up learnings into a digital product for those who are less good fits or can’t afford your price.
1605208125526740993 2022-12-20 14:26:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush That little stack of Moleskine notebooks is like pornography to a writer.
1605195286414036992 2022-12-20 13:35:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @piros_eth Yep. Go out for a 90 minute walk, sans phone.
1605194952056922115 2022-12-20 13:34:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hedithewriter Thanks. IT's basically a little self help book without the 200 pages.
1605194835358584835 2022-12-20 13:34:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvanThomson01 I've found it to be for me!
1605194789728796672 2022-12-20 13:33:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom 100%. I used to feel like each day I had to cram as much as possible into the 24 hours I was given.   Now I cut a lot of meaningless work out, and work in bursts.
1605194649693569028 2022-12-20 13:33:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy Not drastically. Too many options to pay 10%+
1605194567640285184 2022-12-20 13:33:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Thanks for reading it, Cole.
1605194536317247492 2022-12-20 13:32:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Thank you, Jason!
1605192065238851585 2022-12-20 13:23:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1605192062755901440 2022-12-20 13:23:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Take care of your physical and mental health:   Taking care of your physical &amp; mental health is essential for re-wiring the way you think.  Eat a healthy diet, exercise, and prioritize sleep, relaxation, and stress management.  Just doing this alone changes your brain.
1605192060470009857 2022-12-20 13:23:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Surround yourself with positive influences:   The people you spend time with have a massive impact on your thoughts and behaviors.   Surround yourself with optimistic winners.   People who are supportive and positive, and who will encourage you to reach your full potential.
1605192058414710784 2022-12-20 13:23:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Learn from your mistakes:   When you make a mistake, don't panic.  It's important to be cognizant of mistakes and try to see them as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than as a failure.   Write your mistake down, analyze it, and look for ways to do better next time.
1605192055990403072 2022-12-20 13:23:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Practice mindfulness:   Mindfulness is the practice of being present and engaged in the current moment.   This drastically helps reduce stress, improve focus, &amp; increase self-awareness.  Shut your phone off to be with your family.  Put it on do-not-disturb 24/7/365 if you can.
1605192053322817537 2022-12-20 13:23:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Stay organized:   Organizing your thoughts, tasks, and surroundings can help you stay focused and on track.   Use tools like Notion, calendars, and smart planners to help you stay organized.  Remember to tie organized actions back to your SMART goals from above.
1605192050474885120 2022-12-20 13:23:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Take breaks:   Taking regular breaks can help recharge and refocus your mind.  This is proven to improve your overall performance and productivity.  I don't know a single great thinker who is on 24/7/365.  Remember - bursts, not burnout.
1605192048218439680 2022-12-20 13:23:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Practice visualization:   Visualization is a wonderful tool that can help you flip your mind to think more positively and confidently.   Try visualizing yourself achieving your goals and succeeding in different situations.  Paint a picture in your mind of a positive future.
1605192045223727105 2022-12-20 13:23:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Set clear goals:   Every quarter, create SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals that you can work towards.  These can roll up to your yearly goals for yourself and your business.  This provides a simple roadmap to stay focused and motivated.
1605192042388357127 2022-12-20 13:23:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to rewire your brain (to think like a champion):

1604922860459302912 2022-12-19 19:33:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoeydeWit_ So true.
1604920874855006219 2022-12-19 19:25:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> All those questions you have about entrepreneurship get answered when you just start.
1604893912963121152 2022-12-19 17:38:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen @AdamMGrant I have not, but I will. Thanks!
1604884815123124224 2022-12-19 17:02:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @flourish_firm This is awesome. Love it.
1604880306795937792 2022-12-19 16:44:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sunglassesface It's my take, as is everything I write.
1604880141662171137 2022-12-19 16:43:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza Exactly.
1604880086406410240 2022-12-19 16:43:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NealOGrady Nah. I live 2 hours outside of NYC!
1604878054521708545 2022-12-19 16:35:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One of the clearest signs of intelligence is being interested in other people’s perspectives.   95% of people I meet aren’t.   Crazy.
1604868972528254983 2022-12-19 15:59:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe People miss the "for yourself" part. They just curate and aggregate other people's thoughts and then wonder why nobody buys from them.
1604830234251087873 2022-12-19 13:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> An observation about solopreneurs on Twitter:  Many struggle to make $1 online because they are focused on how to make $1M online.  Making $1 will change the way you think.  Start small, not grandiose.

1604555899657670656 2022-12-18 19:15:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai What an awesome compliment. I appreciate it more than you know.
1604497196681871360 2022-12-18 15:21:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Combine this with Atomic Habits for a 1-2 punch.
1604474026214277122 2022-12-18 13:49:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje That immutable laws of writing graphic is great man.   Congrats on the launch!
1604473697129050112 2022-12-18 13:48:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SteveOnSpeed Never buy RTs.   But 100% you should network and build supportive groups of creators.
1604472198454194176 2022-12-18 13:42:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spontaneousbkpk People were getting shadow banned for no reason, so I decided to diversify.
1604470665385574401 2022-12-18 13:36:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @optimizium_eth @albadawee Thank you both!
1604469405853036545 2022-12-18 13:31:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Nah. You've already got the notes!
1604466783011864576 2022-12-18 13:21:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Great advice here, Blake.
1604466547409489923 2022-12-18 13:20:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour I hope so too. Will be weird to remember the old 280 character Twitter in years to come.
1604466409613950977 2022-12-18 13:19:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alxberman I appreciate that, Alex!
1604466333948821506 2022-12-18 13:19:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RahulHakhla Haha. Thanks, Rahul.
1604466292391542784 2022-12-18 13:19:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Thank you for the kind words, my man.
1604465316863565826 2022-12-18 13:15:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1604465311238877184 2022-12-18 13:15:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  Step 1: Write the body using headers and white space Step 2: Use a specific call to action to tell readers what to do. Step 3: Write compelling hook lines by using my recommendations.
1604465302456225792 2022-12-18 13:15:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Example 4: Get right to the point
1604465300321222656 2022-12-18 13:15:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Example 3: Compare &amp; Contrast
1604465293304242178 2022-12-18 13:15:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Example 2: Use eye-catching numbers
1604465291064393728 2022-12-18 13:15:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Example 1: Tell people what they'll get &amp; address an objection
1604465288581365767 2022-12-18 13:15:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lastly, craft a great "hook" Tweet:  The most critically important step in writing Tweet threads is the "Hook" Tweet.  This is the first Tweet in your thread, and it makes or breaks your entire thread.  I've found there are 4 ways to open a killer Thread.  Here they are ↓
1604465284890476546 2022-12-18 13:15:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Add a great CTA:  People write threads &amp; then forget to tell the reader what to do at the end.  Here are some example CTA's:  - Follow you - Buy your product - Join your newsletter - Retweet the first Tweet - Read another thread you wrote  Check out this one from me:  https://t.co/FAcm79LXX5
1604465272013963265 2022-12-18 13:15:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Use headers and white space:  A header simply tells the reader what to expect in each Tweet they are reading.  White space is the space between lines so that it's easier on the eyes.  Don't use too much whitespace, but just enough to make it easy.  Here's an example of both:  https://t.co/THRrxPJOPl
1604465260878090240 2022-12-18 13:15:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Start by writing the body:  The body of the thread is the information you're attempting to convey.  It should add very specific value:  - Teach something step-by-step - Tell an interesting story - Share a framework - Dispel a myth  Stay away from nebulous observations.
1604465257115967488 2022-12-18 13:15:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Here's what you'll learn by reading this:  1. Starting with a great thread body 2. Using headers and white space 3. Writing a direct call-to-action 4. 4 killer thread openers  Let's dive in ↓

1604128806423371778 2022-12-17 14:58:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Excellent curation here. Nice to shine a light on these folks.
1604128497332518912 2022-12-17 14:56:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Keep ‘em coming man. 🔥
1604128264208797699 2022-12-17 14:55:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Congrats, Matt. Thanks for the shout my man.
1604103249379971072 2022-12-17 13:16:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randomrecruiter That's true.
1604103215640973318 2022-12-17 13:16:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bakerlink Very thorough. 10/10.

1604101845315616768 2022-12-17 13:10:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I wanted to work for a company that cared deeply about me, so I employed myself.

1603806704948461598 2022-12-16 17:38:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Winning comment.
1603803732315193357 2022-12-16 17:26:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There's probably $100,000+ of unrealized income sitting between your ears.  Have a great weekend.

1603743045639229441 2022-12-16 13:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3 things creators get wrong about audience building:  1. They don't become a "familiar character." 2. They and be better instead of different. 3. They don't "scale the ladder."  Tomorrow, I'll show 66,100+ subscribers exactly what I mean.  Join us below ↓

1603471253985234960 2022-12-15 19:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most people believe you need to accumulate wealth to leave the rat race.   I believe you need to leave the rat race to accumulate wealth.

1603435151857442829 2022-12-15 17:01:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @saastrash There are always outliers for sure.  I just wouldn't depend on being one.
1603431780656287744 2022-12-15 16:48:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dew2kris Thousands, likely.
1603431375734198272 2022-12-15 16:46:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maljunkul An online audience is one distribution channel, sure. There are others too.
1603431282842767362 2022-12-15 16:46:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @roalho Correct, but you still need attention, and that's the hardest part.
1603431121223557124 2022-12-15 16:45:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Damn. That's a good Tweet.  I forgot about that one 😂
1603431019897819136 2022-12-15 16:45:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NealOGrady Neal - moving to CK this week. Let's revisit your email to me about newsletter stuff soon.
1603430931448094722 2022-12-15 16:44:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool Become your own PR firm. Shout it from the rooftops!
1603428466023596032 2022-12-15 16:35:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Building a product is important, but building distribution first is crucial.  Lots of people build things, but very few get them into the hands of the right people.
1603426851510026240 2022-12-15 16:28:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Wow. This looks awesome. Congrats on putting it together fellas :)
1603389695152607232 2022-12-15 14:01:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Great process.  How do you package up your learnings and create a plan to take action?   Is it just little micro-moves or do you create a full-scale plan?
1603388919868928000 2022-12-15 13:58:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Samfarber_ That's knowledge, not wisdom.
1603388795688206345 2022-12-15 13:57:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JarvisKa I don't use it, so I'm not sure.
1603388686497988609 2022-12-15 13:57:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danielcberk Haha. It's just what I do each week, written in a simple format.  No hacks, no tricks.
1603388580998545410 2022-12-15 13:56:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrewKMedia It's not a great newsletter tool, honestly. It's just what I know how to use.  Try @ConvertKit  or @beehiiv
1603387230369861635 2022-12-15 13:51:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Since moving to a new city, I've been doing this thing where I try and repeat the person's name to them 2-3 times the first time I meet them.  Then, I address them by name each time I see them moving forward.  I used to suck at names. Now I'm pretty darn good at it.
1603386941256474632 2022-12-15 13:50:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Find someone doing something moderately well, and do it much better.   Congrats, you win.
1603386781369618438 2022-12-15 13:49:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew A marathon is just 55,000 steps one after the other.   Building a business isn't that different.
1603386481392828416 2022-12-15 13:48:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Smart. Don't work in the business, work on it. Great catch and pivot here, Jay.
1603382347621097472 2022-12-15 13:31:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom You can. You've already got 2 newsletters, just write a 3rd, you machine. 😉
1603382061976494080 2022-12-15 13:30:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Thanks, brother!
1603382025150398466 2022-12-15 13:30:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrewKMedia I use Kajabi, but have found that using what you know how to use keep friction low.
1603381905948385280 2022-12-15 13:30:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alan_cheng I haven't. I think most of that advice discounts how many people you turn off.
1603381044094402563 2022-12-15 13:26:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje 1. I think so. Show your true authority and expertise rather than crowdsourcing others.  2. I think you can choose little niche topics underneath the umbrella of a larger topic.
1603380830805676032 2022-12-15 13:25:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Dude - Idea is the toughest...Sometimes that takes 10-15 minutes by itself and delays me process.
1603380150539878401 2022-12-15 13:23:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @M_Rxtcliffe Cool. Love that addition!
1603380061368995841 2022-12-15 13:22:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @callmehouck For sure. Give it a reread - does it sound like me? Are there any trip ups?
1603379988312608769 2022-12-15 13:22:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Same!
1603379612523831297 2022-12-15 13:21:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel That's amazing man!
1603379003041226752 2022-12-15 13:18:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1603378996355497984 2022-12-15 13:18:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Edit using a system:  Here's mine:  - Are your sentences concise and understandable? - Do you have any long, ongoing tangents? - Do you deliver what is promised in the headline? - Did you add links to relevant resources?
1603378994346336258 2022-12-15 13:18:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Write the title:  With the first newsletter draft written, it's much easier to choose a title.  Use a subject line tester to see how "good" or "bad" your title is.  Work it until you're sure you'll have decent open rates.
1603378992538681344 2022-12-15 13:18:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Add images, video, and research:  Once you have the body, you can add supporting multimedia.  Find your Tweet/Book/Quote from above and insert it.  If you need an image or video to help explain something, now is the time to put it in place.
1603378990252785670 2022-12-15 13:18:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Fill out the body:  Now you can fill the information in to support each header.  Use this framework:  - Start with an opening line that explains the header. - A paragraph about what you learned about the header. - A paragraph about how to put learnings into action.
1603378988197548032 2022-12-15 13:18:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Write the headers:  Before I write anything else, I write the headers.  This basically gives me an outline to follow and makes it much easier to write.  Once you have the headers, you have a little treasure map to follow.
1603378984619851776 2022-12-15 13:18:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Use a template:  This is where most of my speed comes from.  I use a newsletter template so that I can generally follow the same process each week.  - What's a big problem? - How do most people solve it? - Why doesn't it work for them? - How would I solve it differently?
1603378982514204675 2022-12-15 13:18:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Gather information:  Once you've chosen your topic, then do some research to back up your thoughts.  I like to Google and look for:  - One book - One Tweet - One quote - One article  Then, choose 1 or 2 and use them inside of your issue.
1603378980341571585 2022-12-15 13:18:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Chose an idea:  If you want to go faster, you should always be building an idea bank.  Take 15 minutes per day and look at:  - YouTube channels - Aggregator newsletters - Relevant news stories - Things you've learned  Jot them down and keep a running list.

1603108886864609283 2022-12-14 19:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If I had to start my solopreneur journey over, here's what I'd do:  - Pick a skill I know cold - Talk about it daily online - Offer to help 3 companies free - Track meaningful improvements - Get a few testimonials for my website - Ask for intros to other companies &amp; charge $$$
1603066101189033984 2022-12-14 16:35:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every job comes with risk, but only solopreneurship comes with autonomy.
1603034702520139776 2022-12-14 14:30:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Got myself the same Nespresso machine. Love it. ☕️
1603021023724576768 2022-12-14 13:36:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Nailed it.  I knew employment wasn't for me when I had to cancel a trip to Thailand that I had been planning for 3 months.
1603020898944040964 2022-12-14 13:35:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MattU_FP I do 99% on my own.   I have a part-time VA that works about 20 hours per month on customer service.
1603020779607785472 2022-12-14 13:35:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew The funny part is both come with risk, and only one comes with autonomy.
1603018869853278209 2022-12-14 13:27:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jurijtokarski In the end, no boss at work cares about you when it comes down to them or you.   So might as well be your own boss.
1603018576830627842 2022-12-14 13:26:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @talktoterryco Correct.  Purse curiosities and live with purpose.
1603018518353825792 2022-12-14 13:26:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai I love that, Leo.
1603018464989421568 2022-12-14 13:25:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianFeroldi I think so too, Brian.
1603018402251300867 2022-12-14 13:25:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Same here. It's fun to get paid to be creative, but also have almost total flexibility.
1603018323855568896 2022-12-14 13:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Sahil the HS philosopher. I dig it :)
1603017851119493120 2022-12-14 13:23:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ I've also been using the headline analyzer. Really interesting feedback. Hypefury is obviously my jam.
1603017432624672773 2022-12-14 13:21:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe I haven't worked 8 hours straight since I left my job in August of 2019 and I'd argue my productivity has tripled.
1603016287294263300 2022-12-14 13:17:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The greatest benefit of being a solopreneur is not making money.  It's having the power to orchestrate the life you imagine with no one's permission needed.
1602828166065782785 2022-12-14 00:49:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii @MavenHQ @ChristianWattig @APompliano Congrats man!
1602826789755273216 2022-12-14 00:44:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brianondrako @dickiebush Thank you 🙌
1602826753332088832 2022-12-14 00:44:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlanJLSmith @dickiebush Appreciate it!
1602826723829354497 2022-12-14 00:44:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmfcoaching @dickiebush Thanks! 🔥
1602725869193158656 2022-12-13 18:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Betting on yourself is an act of confidence.  Fighting the status quo takes guts.  Being willing to fail takes bravery.  Here's to all of the Solopreneurs out there who don't get the accolades of unicorn-entrepreneurs but go through a lot of the same shit.

1602661720316583936 2022-12-13 13:48:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse I love that, Jay. Great name for it.
1602661486119321600 2022-12-13 13:47:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Yikes. I read daily as a child. Is that 14%? goodness.
1602661306817040386 2022-12-13 13:46:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Distribution gives you incredible leverage and optionality. That's why top-of-funnel will always be so critical.
1602660920047583233 2022-12-13 13:45:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Working on this right now. Nutrition is my killer. Love hamburgers and fries too much. Time to get this dialed in.
1602659939608137728 2022-12-13 13:41:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday I've been slowly minimizing for years. I found that going "all in" was really tough for me.  I started by getting rid of a bunch of things I didn't need. Freed up so much space in my life.  Great thread, Ben.
1602659173086511105 2022-12-13 13:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Haha. Them's some good hacks, Nick.
1602658948686946304 2022-12-13 13:37:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessedanyusufco I don't use it, so I don't have an opinion, but many people swear by it.
1602658634231595009 2022-12-13 13:36:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Smart! Might steal :)
1602658548701347844 2022-12-13 13:35:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Smart. I haven't used it but have considered it.  Glad to hear it's working for you man!
1602658440777703427 2022-12-13 13:35:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ZaneMcCormack 100%. I had a massive panic attack in December of 2018.  It was the worst day of my life.
1602658255687372800 2022-12-13 13:34:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @callmehouck Thanks for the inclusion with these wonderful newsletters. I greatly appreciate it!
1602657372098396160 2022-12-13 13:31:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nailingthreads I read a lot.
1602657343971495937 2022-12-13 13:31:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Yes. Very, very tough. That's why I have a "no" template.
1602657276531179520 2022-12-13 13:30:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattbarkercopy I turned off all notifications and I'm on DND 24/7 now. Love it!
1602655806553559042 2022-12-13 13:24:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @akashsaha__ Agreed.  It happens because of loss of control.
1602655735552376835 2022-12-13 13:24:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel I've got that on email and LinkedIn. Works like a charm.
1602655694410420224 2022-12-13 13:24:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Absolutely!
1602655647274778624 2022-12-13 13:24:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I'm in a Discord group of people building similar lifestyles as mine which is super helpful.  For support, I do a weekly check-in with my wife, and a weekly check-in with my parents.
1602654749534420992 2022-12-13 13:20:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it.  If you're suffering from burnout, I hope these simple tips are helpful.  If you found value in this thread, then:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1602654747516981255 2022-12-13 13:20:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Seek professional help:   If you're struggling to overcome burnout, consider seeing a therapist.  There's no shame in therapy. In fact, it's the opposite.  I've seen a therapist off and on since I was 24 years old, and I can confidently say I perform better when I have one.
1602654745054904323 2022-12-13 13:20:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Prioritize your tasks:   What's actually important for you to get done?  Like, REALLY important?  Be honest with yourself and eliminate, automate, and delegate everything outside of the 20% of work that truly moves the needle.
1602654738536857602 2022-12-13 13:20:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Take time for yourself:   Back in 2018 and 2019 I had no hobbies.   It was just work, work, work.  Now, I  read, learn Spanish and cook on a regular basis. I love investing time in things that require no (or little) time on the computer.
1602654736523661312 2022-12-13 13:20:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Seek support:   Don't be afraid to seek support from friends, family, and colleagues.   Solopreneurship is really hard.  You need family and friends you can be open and transparent with, and you need a smart group of peers to help you realize when you're pushing too hard.
1602654734724341760 2022-12-13 13:20:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Get enough sleep:   Ever since 2020 I've been going to sleep around 9:30p or 10:00p and getting up around 6:00a.   When I was 30 I could work on 6 hours of sleep, but in my 40s, I need the whole 8.   This is arguably the most important part (for me) of avoiding burnout.
1602654732736135169 2022-12-13 13:20:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Set boundaries:   One of the easiest ways to burn out is to be a people pleaser.  Scrutinize each "ask" for your time and be stingy with it.  The best thing you can do is invest your time in your own self-care and with your family.
1602654730786050049 2022-12-13 13:20:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Exercise:  Each morning, I walk with my wife for 90 minutes or use the treadmill or elliptical machine at my local gym.  For me, exercise in the morning sets the right tone for the day and helps me make healthier choices as the day goes by.
1602654728340529154 2022-12-13 13:20:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Take breaks:  Make sure to take breaks throughout the day to rest and recharge.   I book 15 or 30-minute breaks in between all writing sessions and meetings I have on my calendar.  This helps prevent staring at the computer screen for 8 hours in a row which gives me anxiety.
1602654726448943105 2022-12-13 13:20:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've worked myself to the point of burnout twice.  But in 2020, I finally got it under control.  Here are my 8 anti-burnout tips for solopreneurs:
1602416563537481728 2022-12-12 21:34:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl @agazdecki Impressive lineup! Looking fwd to hearing Andrew.  A real inspiring entrepreneur if you ask me.
1602394078213177352 2022-12-12 20:04:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Your name must be on it.   Why I never have produced under a business name.

1602364145097216012 2022-12-12 18:05:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The greatest threat to your success is relying on someone else for it.
1602363461803151386 2022-12-12 18:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> On social media, you either are the marketing funnel or you're in one.
1602351928255647746 2022-12-12 17:17:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PathToIkigai Thanks for the feature here.   Good luck! 📈
1602343126412189698 2022-12-12 16:42:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you like writing systems, here's another one I use to quickly create 5-10 pieces of content:   https://t.co/x6Rz5vGVEa
1602301587229130752 2022-12-12 13:57:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Congrats man!
1602298531401924611 2022-12-12 13:45:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Thanks, Bryan!
1602298525064241153 2022-12-12 13:45:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkShust @jayclouse I really just use Hemingway to make sure my writing is easy to understand. Sometimes it has bad recs, sometimes they are great. Use discretion.
1602297531366608899 2022-12-12 13:41:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @johnscharts @AthleticBrewing is one of my faves. Their new NA Triple IPA is my go-to during the week.
1602295849731690497 2022-12-12 13:34:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegoldsuite Yes, usually.
1602294006502785027 2022-12-12 13:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse It's nice to keep things simple, Jay. I love it. And it's free.
1602293670954295300 2022-12-12 13:25:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Thanks, man! :)
1602293563064205312 2022-12-12 13:25:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess @hypefury Hell yes. That's what I like to hear.
1602293515886764034 2022-12-12 13:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Now to add a few tweaks in 2023...
1602293437394567168 2022-12-12 13:24:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ranbirsinghlive Pick one platform and get really good. Or if it's just written, then maybe written cross-posting. But don't add insta - too much time for very little results.
1602292574076780545 2022-12-12 13:21:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Very simple, but very effective.
1602292520398082051 2022-12-12 13:21:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @liana_majed It's a lovely little app.
1602292076569399298 2022-12-12 13:19:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NFT_GOD Love it!
1602291580920119296 2022-12-12 13:17:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1602291578428588040 2022-12-12 13:17:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 5: Stay consistent  Writing consistently is the most important step of all.  Here's the TL;DR:  • Ideate with topics/structures • Format with tools like Typeshare • Edit with tools like Hemingway • Distribute with tools like HypeFury
1602291575069069313 2022-12-12 13:17:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 4: Distribute widely  99% of people waste distribution opportunities.  You've already written something.  Why not share it everywhere that's relevant?  I use @Hypefury to send my content to multiple platforms.  - Twitter - LinkedIn - Instagram  The tool is powerful as hell.  https://t.co/tP0o0MLsc9
1602291566248337410 2022-12-12 13:17:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 3: Edit ruthlessly  No easier way to lose a reader than unclear writing.  So, once I'm done, I pass my writing through @HemingwayApp  It tells me:  - The grade level - Poor word choices - Poor sentence structure  Paste in your writing and see where you can simplify.  https://t.co/JW2FM15qha
1602291557759176704 2022-12-12 13:17:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 2: Choose a solid format  Struggling to format your writing?  There are so many tools out there to help.  I am loving @typeshare_co  They have beautiful templates built right in for inspiration.  No better way to get started.  https://t.co/B135KOLW0n
1602291546350669824 2022-12-12 13:17:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 1: Ideate rapidly  What’s the fastest way to come up with ideas?  Use systems.  I created my own content matrix in Notion.  - Choose a topic - Match it to a style - Write a quick headline - Repeat until you have 10 ideas  Much of writing is about systems.  https://t.co/QrHxlphw58
1602291538851241984 2022-12-12 13:17:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My content has been read 279.8M+ times this year.  Here's my very simple 5-step writing process:
1602100580431892481 2022-12-12 00:38:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets @dickiebush You think it was the newsletter but it was just you, my man.
1602080039679541253 2022-12-11 23:17:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alecfwilson @sweatystartup It's historical non-fiction. You're correct🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

1601938392958308354 2022-12-11 13:54:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylecordes @gregisenberg Build it.
1601937770938777602 2022-12-11 13:51:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Great exercise. You've just inspired me.
1601937693243498496 2022-12-11 13:51:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Every Tweet is a sales and marketing person working on behalf of your company for hours, days, and sometimes weeks.
1601937542974246913 2022-12-11 13:50:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Smart Tweet.
1601937461780832256 2022-12-11 13:50:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki I saw this very clearly when building our sales organization. Very first salesperson must be an A+. Has to be. Sets the tone for everyone else.
1601937032477282304 2022-12-11 13:48:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue @gregisenberg is your man.
1601935905954140161 2022-12-11 13:44:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Onboarding yourself is a really great term. Stealing that.
1601934152428830721 2022-12-11 13:37:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabe_llewellyn Thanks, man. Just a simple little list of projects, but hopefully helpful to someone.
1601932931232063491 2022-12-11 13:32:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Farradfaizee Right. Them's the basics.
1601931769598681088 2022-12-11 13:27:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder 100%. And there is no "right" way to approach these. A million combinations and orders out there.
1601931363623616512 2022-12-11 13:26:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yairmenchel Haha. Reason #435 why I don't have children :)
1601931060245315599 2022-12-11 13:25:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisLaubWrites I do consider it one, yes.  Physical mail could be one too, I suppose!
1601930449986916353 2022-12-11 13:22:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sam7rs Thanks, Samir.
1601930268289691655 2022-12-11 13:21:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ASimpleNotion No. I'd like to keep it free to the reader, but I appreciate it.
1601930174366351361 2022-12-11 13:21:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I get the feeling you're good :)
1601930016669171712 2022-12-11 13:20:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FreddyExem Disagree. Keep it on the side until it replaces 60% of your total income, then go all in.
1601929857436454914 2022-12-11 13:20:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gmitslouie 100%, Louie.
1601929833994387456 2022-12-11 13:20:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill Agreed. Then use products to free up your time.
1601929059260301313 2022-12-11 13:17:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I break down these 4 examples in a recent newsletter issue:  - The pros - The cons - The tech  And more...  Read it here:    https://t.co/E0I3H8f496
1601929057490305025 2022-12-11 13:17:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4. Create a subscription email  Why I like subscription emails:  The scale is incredible.   As the customer base grows, the work effort generally remains the same, meaning that you make a lot more money without much extra work
1601929055372189696 2022-12-11 13:17:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. Start a paid community  Why I like paid communities:  Building a space where people of similar interests can congregate improves your brand, builds trust, &amp; deepens relationships.  This helps grow your audience and build your business.  Get this right and it's powerful.
1601929052931166208 2022-12-11 13:17:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. Create a digital course  Why I like digital courses:   People can purchase the courses 24/7/365.  Once you've serviced people using example 1 (above) take your biggest learnings and put them in a course.  Build a small affiliate program to drive even more sales.
1601929051031191552 2022-12-11 13:17:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Build a service-based business  Why I like a service-based business:   Generally, easier and lower cost to get started.  Plus you can likely charge 3x to 5x what you make (hourly) at your 9 to 5 job.  Find people 2-3 years behind you in your expertise and help them.
1601929049298948098 2022-12-11 13:17:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone should have a side project that earns $150+ per day.  Here are 4 simple examples that might help:
1601766847032229888 2022-12-11 02:32:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado You get nothing tangible in return?
1601742459712991232 2022-12-11 00:55:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oliviercantin THAT is what I was trying to say. Bravo.
1601741824498237440 2022-12-11 00:53:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oliviercantin I think about this a lot.  The beliefs are always non-obvious (interesting &amp; against the status quo/norm) but predictable to those waiting for the belief - it's the medicine they crave over and over.   I don't know if that makes sense, but it makes sense in my head.

1601613583078420480 2022-12-10 16:23:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thefernandocz @wizofecom @thedankoe @OneJKMolina @ItsKieranDrew Glad my content is helpful. I really appreciate it 🙌🏻
1601580384977756160 2022-12-10 14:11:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrishlad I have strong, natural opinions that are the opposite of "best practices" and I share them without hesitation.   I think identifying where you have different beliefs than the norm is a great place to start.
1601580130039914497 2022-12-10 14:10:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii So damn true.
1601573426095083521 2022-12-10 13:43:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Thanks, Alex. Appreciate it, man.
1601569034096365568 2022-12-10 13:26:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thanks for being a willing participant 🙌
1601568924600274944 2022-12-10 13:26:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachRizwani It sounds too good to be true until people try.
1601568827598598146 2022-12-10 13:25:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamierusso Thank you, Jamie. I appreciate it, man. :)
1601568027945811968 2022-12-10 13:22:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UncleBimBim Take one small meaningful piece of action. Analyze. Then force another one. It's tough though!
1601567946710855681 2022-12-10 13:22:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thechrisbaumann I never forgot it when I heard it.
1601567905178521601 2022-12-10 13:21:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy Happy Saturday, my man.
1601567875495387136 2022-12-10 13:21:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom So low.   You can do it with almost no money and very few tools.
1601567650416513026 2022-12-10 13:20:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom "Glorify the right things.   Let go of status symbols like busyness and 100-hour-weeks. Celebrate sleeping 8 hours, regular physical activity, and freedom. Control of your time is true wealth."  This is everything right here and where my whole head is at in 2023.
1601566742022688769 2022-12-10 13:17:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Two quick last things if you have the time:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1601566740231643137 2022-12-10 13:17:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you enjoyed this then you'd love my weekly newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.  Every Saturday I share one tip to launch, grow, &amp; monetize your internet business.  All in less than 4 minutes.  Join 65,000+ subscribers here:    https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
1601566738344251392 2022-12-10 13:17:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When people ask questions, share the link:  Now, when people ask questions, you can share your brand new link.  Sure, some people won't book, but some will.   And if 3-4 people do, you're paying off that mortgage faster than ever.  Congrats, you now have your first side business.
1601566736645488641 2022-12-10 13:17:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Continue focusing on the problem you solve:  The next part is critical.  Keep creating that red pill content.  Now that you have your business set up, you're ready to drive customers.  Push out content daily on LinkedIn/Twitter or anywhere else you normally hang out.
1601566734724595712 2022-12-10 13:17:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Add the link to your social profiles:  Attach your Carrd landing page to a custom URL and add it to your social pages.  - Twitter Bio - A personal website - LinkedIn featured section - Your YouTube Page  And anywhere else that people can find you online.
1601566732849762306 2022-12-10 13:17:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Open up a few slots outside of your 9 to 5:  Pick a few times outside of your 9 to 5 where you'd like to make a bit of extra cash.  Maybe it's just 3-4 hours per week, but if you fill those slots, that's an extra $2,000 or more per month.  That's some people's mortgage.
1601566731054596096 2022-12-10 13:17:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Choose a reasonable price point:  Start with a price that people are willing to pay.  But make it 2x to 3x what you make at work.  For example, if you make $100k at work, that's basically $50/hour.  Try $150/hour.  Experiment often to find the sweet spot.
1601566729146175492 2022-12-10 13:17:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create a paid coaching call:  "From X to Y in 60 minutes"  The more specific you can make the outcome, the better.  It's not: "Learn to code" It's: "From clueless to coding your first HTML page in 60 minutes."  The outcome is clear.  You'll learn to code your first page in HTML.
1601566726478610432 2022-12-10 13:17:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Open up a Calendly account ($12):  Open up a Calendly account &amp; embed it on your landing page.  This provides a seamless way to get people into your calendar for your new business consulting/coaching.  Now, let's make it easy for people to understand what they'll get.
1601566724670820352 2022-12-10 13:17:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Embed 5-8 testimonials:  Social proof helps close deals.  Ask the 10 people you helped for free to write you some.  Tell them to talk about the problem they had and how you solved it.  Put the testimonials near the top so people see them.  Get some near your "buy" button.
1601566721332084743 2022-12-10 13:17:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build a landing page on Carrd ($19):  Once you have a standardized process, you need a place to offer it.  I recommend using @Carrd to build simple, beautiful, functional landing pages for just $19 per year.  Here are 5 tips for building a great one:
1601566718861758465 2022-12-10 13:17:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create standard processes:  Once you understand the problem, you need a solution.  But it's best when standardized.  A step-by-step process that predictably delivers high-quality results for the people you intend to help.  This is a more scalable process than ad-libbing it.
1601566717049769984 2022-12-10 13:17:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Chat with 10 people for free:  Work to get 10 people on Zoom who have the same problem.  A problem you can solve with your "red pill" thinking.  Do deep discovery in 4 levels:  L1: Technical problem L2: Historical problem L3: Financial impact L4: Personal impact
1601566715162370048 2022-12-10 13:17:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Look for questions + DM opportunities:  When you create content like that, you're going to get questions.  Questions present opportunity.  When you're starting, leverage a combo of public/private responses.  Answer questions publically, and take it to DM to add deeper context.
1601566713245536259 2022-12-10 13:17:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create Red Pill content around one challenge:  "Red pill" content is something I heard @ShaanVP say on a podcast and I've never forgotten it.  Your content should present a new take. A new angle.  A different approach than other people take to solve a challenge.  Be different.
1601566705876357121 2022-12-10 13:17:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Clean up your profiles:  Your social media profiles are mini landing pages.  With one glance, prospects should know:  - Who you are - What journey you are on - What people should expect if they follow you  Capture attention by being clear, not clever.
1601566703481151488 2022-12-10 13:17:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> By the end of this thread you will have:  1. Clear social profiles 2. "Red pill" content 3. Deep customer knowledge 4. A standardized service business 5. Simple technology to run it 6. Great social proof for it 7. A better process for making $$  Let's go ↓

1601004913274028032 2022-12-09 00:04:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @grdeken @KateBour @kamilrextin @ChelseaCastle @AdrienneNakohl I have a Subaru :)
1601002539230842880 2022-12-08 23:55:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ZubyMusic It took me 12 years to reach 8,000 followers and 1 year to reach 250,000.
1601002044537507843 2022-12-08 23:53:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic @BrandonFluharty Yes. Santa Barbara, CA
1601001211536105472 2022-12-08 23:50:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonFluharty Nashville is a great city for some people.   It just didn't work for us for some reason that I can't describe.  We decided we wanted more land, more privacy, but access to a massive city like NYC.  This has been almost perfect so far.
1600999975365713920 2022-12-08 23:45:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danprimack Every problem like this deserves a solution.   Who is out there solving this problem? Anyone?
1600997498633728000 2022-12-08 23:35:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ethanwnel I mean IRL gatherings, not online.
1600971635477344257 2022-12-08 21:52:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichaelNatelli These are IRL meetings where people don't know anything about me.
1600971064263442433 2022-12-08 21:50:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer @andrewhosf Jennifer and I do this a lot. We grill every server (in a good way) and are just genuinely curious in their life plans. I guess that's what 41 will do to ya.
1600970878761996288 2022-12-08 21:49:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spontaneousbkpk I don't know that I have one.  I just like engaging with people back and forth. It's weird when I meet someone, ask them 15 questions, and then at the end of the night, they come back and are like, "Oh yeah -  I forgot to ask. What's your name?"
1600970601224896512 2022-12-08 21:48:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @deanjmoon IRL.
1600970400355139584 2022-12-08 21:47:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @helloworld_agna I just mean in simple IRL gatherings.
1600970309930143744 2022-12-08 21:47:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @khemaridh This is a great response. Thanks, Khe!
1600967767284674560 2022-12-08 21:37:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GuruAnaerobic I should have said strangers because that's what I meant. IRL strangers.
1600967453093564416 2022-12-08 21:36:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjankoch Haha. These are IRL meetings.
1600967423313661953 2022-12-08 21:35:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CryptoB513 Great. Thanks for asking!
1600967346788917248 2022-12-08 21:35:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisLaubWrites IRL
1600967210142699522 2022-12-08 21:35:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Most likely!
1600966818965094400 2022-12-08 21:33:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CodyCLewis I just like to ask people what they do, and then ask follows ups based on what they say.
1600966620448710656 2022-12-08 21:32:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fellowalk I ask questions like crazy. But at the end of the night, people won't have even asked my name, or where I'm from, or just regular ol' questions.
1600966478874148864 2022-12-08 21:32:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JesseHercules Smart moves.
1600966289131851776 2022-12-08 21:31:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EngineerDogBlog @HewittRueben Haha. I didn't mean for that to sound arrogant in any way, shape, or form.  I just wanted to clarify that this wasn't directed at people I meet online. Just random people in my offline life.
1600966064103624704 2022-12-08 21:30:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer good question :)   Gatherings where people literally have no idea I'm on social media.  Events. Introductions in person. Dinners.  I don't remember it being like this before...
1600965762515992576 2022-12-08 21:29:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @seantconrad Sad. But I like what you did there.
1600965718241333248 2022-12-08 21:29:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendan_aronson These aren't people from calls per se.  They are more just regular life interactions.
1600965604181430272 2022-12-08 21:28:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @creation247 Maybe. Bummer.
1600965567560974336 2022-12-08 21:28:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HewittRueben These are people who have no idea who I am or that I'm on social media.
1600965415676837888 2022-12-08 21:27:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays Goodness.
1600965327596433409 2022-12-08 21:27:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SePP But to answer your question, I just like to know people's story.  What do you do? How did you get into that? How long have you been doing it? Why? Where can I learn more? What's next on the horizon? Big goals for 2023?
1600965104081997824 2022-12-08 21:26:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Haha. Maybe. I was taught that and I'm annoying as hell about asking people things.
1600965011685642240 2022-12-08 21:26:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SePP I ask a million questions.  But these aren't followers or people on Twitter. Just people I meet at friends' houses or random events.  They just talk and talk and talk and talk.
1600964264067584017 2022-12-08 21:23:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 90% of new people I meet don't ask me a single question.  Are people becoming less curious or just more self-absorbed?
1600963512083402760 2022-12-08 21:20:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 This is right up my alley.  A million ways to make money, because there are a million problems and a million solutions.
1600913932348264459 2022-12-08 18:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you try solopreneurship and fall flat on your face, then you're basically in the same position you're in today, but armed with significantly more knowledge and experience for having tried.
1600855655186849792 2022-12-08 14:11:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @businessbarista Glad they were helpful. If I think of anything else that's been on my mind, happy to share, Alex.
1600852132110176256 2022-12-08 13:57:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @feelthebyrn1 Love to hear this :)
1600851991369949184 2022-12-08 13:57:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @businessbarista 1. When it's time to shut down your business 2. Raising capital when you're not well connected 3. Building high-growth, yet highly ethical businesses  Just a few things my friends and I have been chatting about.
1600851273867198467 2022-12-08 13:54:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Start. Then learn. - Sahil Lavingia
1600850968073084928 2022-12-08 13:53:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe And patience.
1600849597181480960 2022-12-08 13:47:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @0xjammin I'll take mine :)
1600847328197345281 2022-12-08 13:38:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabe_llewellyn Yep. Projects I want to work on and time with my wife.
1600847171749756928 2022-12-08 13:38:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Absolutely. If you don't want to keep the door open, you can also remove that part.
1600847099687731201 2022-12-08 13:37:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulEmekaEze I don't include that if I'm not interested.
1600846022762442756 2022-12-08 13:33:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Nice. I'll give this a read, Jay.
1600845226637029377 2022-12-08 13:30:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch Good call :)
1600845126288297984 2022-12-08 13:29:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Glad they are helpful, man.
1600845089219411968 2022-12-08 13:29:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thanks, man.
1600845068356943872 2022-12-08 13:29:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ It's gotta be high-touch, high-explanation.
1600844924639141889 2022-12-08 13:29:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Curious question:  How do you determine when to push through procrastination and when to treat it as a feature?  Meaning, if we constantly procrastinate doing something, is it always something we should be doing in the first place?
1600844135711535104 2022-12-08 13:25:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @I_Am_GKennedy Exactly. Excellent comment.
1600844057949114369 2022-12-08 13:25:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess That's the key. It can't feel harsh. I feel like this email has accomplished that.
1600843656272834561 2022-12-08 13:24:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Nice. It's helpful to have a great way to let people down a bit.
1600843612941524997 2022-12-08 13:23:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Thanks, man. This one email has been a life changer for me.
1600842921481224193 2022-12-08 13:21:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it for today.  If you enjoyed this short thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1600842919270916096 2022-12-08 13:21:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You can copy and paste this email and use it yourself, or send it to your VA to use it.  So far, in over 2 years, I've never received a poor response from this email that I've put together.  It took me a long time to get it right. So save yourself time and copy it.
1600842917521891331 2022-12-08 13:21:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Thank them again and wish them luck:  "Again, thanks for thinking of me. Best of luck with the {{Ask}}, {{FirstName}}."
1600842909997301762 2022-12-08 13:21:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Suggest a future date:  "Please feel free to reach out to me again in 90 days or so, and I might be in a better position to accept."
1600842907015122946 2022-12-08 13:21:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Let them know they aren't alone in getting a no:  "I field a lot of requests and realize that I need to say no if I hope to make meaningful progress on my these projects."
1600842905115058176 2022-12-08 13:21:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Use a cushioned transition:  "I hope you won’t take this personally."
1600842902992740353 2022-12-08 13:21:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Share why you're saying no:  "Unfortunately, with my {{Project1}}, {{Project2}} and {{Project3}}, I'm at capacity and can't book anything else at the moment."
1600842900648218626 2022-12-08 13:21:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Start with a thank you:  "Thanks for thinking of me for your {{Ask}}. I really appreciate it and I normally love doing stuff like this."
1600842898051932160 2022-12-08 13:21:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Saying 'No' is a solopreneur superpower.  But it's incredibly hard to do.  So steal these 6 steps to the perfect "No" email you can use:
1600842839663210496 2022-12-08 13:20:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Company of One by Paul Jarvis is another great one for the solopreneurs  out there.

1600675223417679873 2022-12-08 02:14:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CassandraLRosen It was fabulous. No need to sell up here. It’s a 552 person town with 3 restaurants.
1600672660635414529 2022-12-08 02:04:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TomMullooly @ibuyrvparks 80 minutes from me.
1600672584801976320 2022-12-08 02:04:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ibuyrvparks @TomMullooly Oh nice. You’re just an hour from me.
1600671222148186112 2022-12-08 01:58:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TomMullooly @ibuyrvparks Nice. I’m south on the west side of the Hudson.
1600670866228084737 2022-12-08 01:57:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @atifsabbarali Super bummer
1600670763589275649 2022-12-08 01:57:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshuaKatowitz Wow. Insane photo man.
1600670583880314880 2022-12-08 01:56:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CassandraLRosen Had the top 2  https://t.co/70LfbqPeSZ
1600669763180515330 2022-12-08 01:53:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder You gotta get down here for a weekend my man.
1600669725184229378 2022-12-08 01:52:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ibuyrvparks I am. Upstate. You?
1600669199537704960 2022-12-08 01:50:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drgurner Nope. It’s at the restaurant I’m at.
1600669010013687809 2022-12-08 01:50:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CassandraLRosen Chicken, trout, and blondie deserts.
1600668399784206337 2022-12-08 01:47:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Wednesday nights in Hudson Valley. No more office days.  https://t.co/EtAlKs8qWz
1600625967776645121 2022-12-07 22:59:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @binaryhubio Both. The internal knowing + the validation.
1600625744069246977 2022-12-07 22:58:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MaxiGillberg Shitty. Then motivating. Then awesome.
1600625387943387141 2022-12-07 22:56:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Best reply.
1600598897432399890 2022-12-07 21:11:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Heck yeah. One of my favorite quotes.
1600598671347052544 2022-12-07 21:10:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachMacUK It was exactly what I needed.
1600598560629735424 2022-12-07 21:10:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert For sure, Joseph!
1600598528543363072 2022-12-07 21:10:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejoshuageelen It sure is. I felt like I was letting him down.
1600598338163904541 2022-12-07 21:09:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @carolebozkurt They sure were for me.
1600597935057735687 2022-12-07 21:07:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The most life-changing words someone ever said to me were, 'I think you're capable of much more.'
1600575553173602324 2022-12-07 19:38:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writes_eve That's awesome!  To be clear, I worked a day job for 17 years. And I'm not advocating that people don't work them.  I'm suggesting that if you want to eventually find the maximum return for your time invested, it will almost never be through traditional employment.
1600559277856509952 2022-12-07 18:34:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Thank you, Steve 🙌
1600558425951203329 2022-12-07 18:30:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writes_eve Genuine question:   What happens when you work a day job and create on the side, but the day job gets eliminated?   Are you suggesting that the work on the side is a means to eventually leave or simply to be on the side forever?   Thanks, Eve.
1600551539545980944 2022-12-07 18:03:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There is absolutely nothing wrong with working for someone else, but you'll almost always underprice your most valuable asset: your time.
1600484774195433474 2022-12-07 13:38:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heykahn Yep.  And even higher if you teach $100k, which is an incredibly good business and should be celebrated.
1600484594729553920 2022-12-07 13:37:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Or second.
1600484549997338624 2022-12-07 13:37:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TaniaDiscovered For sure.   My advice should be taken while recognizing context is extremely important, just like anyone else's advice.
1600482487184113664 2022-12-07 13:28:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @I_Am_GKennedy Yep. In everything.
1600482317881032704 2022-12-07 13:28:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adityatheverma @dvassallo Daniel is one of the best playing the game.
1600482276311187456 2022-12-07 13:28:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Once you know that, you can play the game more effectively.
1600480365319159809 2022-12-07 13:20:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessedanyusufco Learn from others while recognizing that all advice requires context.  Go do. What works for you is what works.
1600480015006765057 2022-12-07 13:19:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every top entrepreneur you hear about on the news is a massive outlier.  Just remember that when taking advice.
1600293046318297088 2022-12-07 00:56:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland You got this 🙏
1600189139751690240 2022-12-06 18:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The popular entrepreneurship narrative is to risk it all, triple down, and give 110% effort, 24/7, with no plan B.  The better narrative is to replace 60%-70% of your income and then go all in.

1600128420238790656 2022-12-06 14:01:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Study people, not algorithms.
1600128031363850240 2022-12-06 14:00:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Every suck is one suck closer to not sucking.
1600127923641630720 2022-12-06 14:00:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder It's one of the best things I've reincorporated into my life, in my 40s, Dan. Thanks for giving me the push.
1600126722996809728 2022-12-06 13:55:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Thanks for the inclusion with these superstars, Kieran.
1600124620580958209 2022-12-06 13:46:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom So low. It's incredible how this has changed just in the last 5 years.
1600124486988111872 2022-12-06 13:46:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Some people just build things they believe are "cool" and end up being frustrated when people don't want to pay for it.
1600123493701455873 2022-12-06 13:42:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AaronBatcheldr Oooh. Love this.
1600123461313081345 2022-12-06 13:42:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcuscelestin_ Mostly making assumptions rather than truly understanding what people want.
1600122789620551680 2022-12-06 13:39:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thank you, Blake!
1600120368219373568 2022-12-06 13:29:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza @ericries A terrific book.
1600120343531646982 2022-12-06 13:29:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Ha. Thanks man!
1600120303702589441 2022-12-06 13:29:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @byhazellim 100%. Experience comes from executing over and over and learning. Like anything else.
1600120188229234688 2022-12-06 13:29:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel 100%. I like to look at review sites and look for the top complaints.
1600119157168578562 2022-12-06 13:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danielcberk 100%. A step most people need to nail.
1600119068660375553 2022-12-06 13:24:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Absolutely. Love how you've phrased this here, Daren.
1600118973634605056 2022-12-06 13:24:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy Follow these steps, solve problems, and get ahead.
1600118796093517824 2022-12-06 13:23:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iambergerapi Welcome, Niclas.
1600118399417335808 2022-12-06 13:22:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> And that's it.   A simple step-by-step to build your first product for your audience.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1600118397097938944 2022-12-06 13:22:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ Develop &amp; Expand:  As the MVP gains traction and proves its value, continue to develop and expand the product to meet the evolving needs of users.  Look for areas to increase stickiness, reduce churn, improve word-of-mouth, and solve additional problems you hear from users.
1600118394422009856 2022-12-06 13:22:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/ Analyze &amp; improve:  Continuously monitor and analyze user behavior and feedback to identify areas for improvement and new features to add.  Don't let one customer pull you in any specific direction, no matter how big.  Focus on commonalities across pros and cons.
1600118392148709380 2022-12-06 13:22:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Launch:   Launch the MVP and begin gathering data and feedback from users.   Use this information to improve and iterate on the product over time.  Do your hypotheses from testing with Beta users prove to be true across a wider audience of users?
1600118388940066822 2022-12-06 13:22:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Use a lean building approach:  Build the MVP using tools you already know how to use.  This means focusing on the core features and functionality and avoiding unnecessary bells and whistles.  Not a dev? Go no-code with tools like Carrd, Stripe, Airtable, Zapier, etc.
1600118386679218176 2022-12-06 13:22:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Get testing:  Test the prototype with your target audience to gather feedback and make any necessary adjustments.  You want to make sure you're focusing on things like ease of use, stickiness, why users might churn out, etc.   Most importantly: Does this solve the big problem?
1600118379037298694 2022-12-06 13:22:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Find your beta customers:  Your beta customers are likely some of the same people you had conversations with when you started.  Go back to them, restate the problem, share the prototype, and ask if they'd be willing to use it at a low cost in exchange for early feedback.
1600118376818479104 2022-12-06 13:22:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Build out your prototype:  Create a prototype of your MVP.   This can be a simple mockup or a more detailed wireframe.   The goal is to get a sense of how the product will look and function so that you can put it in front of potential users.
1600118374561972226 2022-12-06 13:22:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Prioritize the most important features:  Create a list of features that fill the gaps you discovered above.   Your MVP will need to have these in order to truly solve the problem.  Prioritize them based on their potential impact and the resources required to implement them.
1600118372443774976 2022-12-06 13:22:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Begin your research phase:  Start by diving deeper into conversations about the problem &amp; where potential solutions fall short.  Check ProductHunt, G2 Crowd, &amp; other review sites.  This will help you understand the landscape &amp; identify potential gaps in competitive solutions.
1600118364822708225 2022-12-06 13:22:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Identify an unsolved problem in the market:  Start by identify a problem or gap in the market you want to serve.  The easiest way? Talk to your audience, look through your comments, check your emails and DMs.  This will be the focus of your MVP.
1600118362444632069 2022-12-06 13:22:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to launch a minimum viable product (MVP).  10 incredibly clear steps anyone can follow:
1599896404364771331 2022-12-05 22:40:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx Automation has allowed me to run my business with only one, part-time VA. It's incredible how you can assemble specialists using Zapier and a few other tools.
1599894756544630785 2022-12-05 22:33:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kyler_Nixon Yeah, probably. Will give it some thought, thanks!

1599826741916205056 2022-12-05 18:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My entire business plan is to do what I want, when I want, with whom I want and do very little of what I hate.
1599779507635859457 2022-12-05 14:55:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup That’s because we’re impressed with futurists whom “solve” problems in this tiny echo chamber.   Thanks for the VR goggles.   I’d like to just get my medical records from one provider to another without a fax machine.
1599763122612477953 2022-12-05 13:50:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Reinforces the importance of taking action.
1599763051347066882 2022-12-05 13:50:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Damn. That's interesting. I do a lot of this in the morning, but hadn't thought of starting the night before. Hmm. Might try this tonight.
1599762895407038466 2022-12-05 13:49:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Short-term results never fix long-term abuse.
1599762776263692288 2022-12-05 13:49:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe You can buy a book for $24 that will give you the permission to get started. You can invest $99 in a course and thousands of dollars worth of tactics.  The problem? Most people want even shorter shortcuts.
1599757615650656258 2022-12-05 13:28:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AnAnasRaza Certainly one of them.
1599757474751721474 2022-12-05 13:27:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danielcberk Nah, just an arbitrary number to be honest.  Retirement for me isn't about not working - I love working.  It's more about not having to care about whether it's successful or not.
1599757215396945920 2022-12-05 13:26:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theshahkunal Carrd + Stripe and you're in the game in 10 minutes.
1599757144806809600 2022-12-05 13:26:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlFaslivingroom I worked for a really demanding entrepreneur back in 2009-2014 who changed how I think about working towards a goal.  I don't think I'd be the person I am today if I hadn't worked for him.
1599756900723064832 2022-12-05 13:25:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Haha.  True.  Focus on the 20% that moves the needles and eliminate, delegate and automate everything else.
1599756440398598144 2022-12-05 13:23:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Don't get too high on the high days and don't get too low on the low days. That's the ticket right there.
1599756340238249984 2022-12-05 13:23:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @leonklam Here's a short Thread I wrote that's just one way to get started:  https://t.co/yChTdO5vLU
1599756123921608705 2022-12-05 13:22:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple This is such a great comment. You captured it perfectly here.
1599755758286999552 2022-12-05 13:21:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NikatNite20 That, and compounding :)
1599755702611759104 2022-12-05 13:20:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel That's it. Just keep being there.
1599755670059827204 2022-12-05 13:20:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Walking a damn marathon.
1599755057276362752 2022-12-05 13:18:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Sometimes, being a successful solopreneur is less about great content, the perfect product, a flashy website, or complex systems.   It's just about resiliency.   One foot in front of the other, every single day for like 5,000 days.
1599530694803263488 2022-12-04 22:26:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse We're on reverse courses.
1599399599344451584 2022-12-04 13:45:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianSexton13 Definitely. Regardless of the definition, we should aim to achieve that specific definition rather than filling our calendars with things that don't help us achieve that definition.   I think we're probably saying the same thing. albeit slightly differently.
1599398647531466752 2022-12-04 13:42:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom My last startup had back-to-back meetings all day with zero breaks.  There would be weeks that would go by and I would honestly question if even one, single thing was accomplished.   Zero recollection of anything we talked about.  Just a bunch of mush.
1599398366554648576 2022-12-04 13:41:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Love these.  I met @DanBenoni from Growth Design a few weeks ago.  Super nice guy and love his stuff.
1599397216715612160 2022-12-04 13:36:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis That man said it better than me.
1599397157252976640 2022-12-04 13:36:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianSexton13 I'm not really talking about achievement here.  I'm simply talking about how people fool themselves into thinking they are productive, when in fact, they are just busy.
1599394344620158980 2022-12-04 13:25:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @remoteoliver I am often some people.
1599394301959495680 2022-12-04 13:24:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theshahkunal That's an awesome term, Kunal. I love that.
1599394220552298496 2022-12-04 13:24:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SWComposer Same here, Sebastian.
1599394179897229313 2022-12-04 13:24:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blairmacgregor @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Same here, Blair.
1599394152474882048 2022-12-04 13:24:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvolvedMindset_ I love that. My second favorite type of IPA.
1599391827689439235 2022-12-04 13:15:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Busyness is a seductive liar.  It paints intense activity as achievement, masking the truth that you're often busy doing nothing productive.
1599384396104015872 2022-12-04 12:45:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MrPassive_ @aaditsh @matt_gray_ Thanks, Mike! Just seeing this now.
1599235499524124672 2022-12-04 02:53:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mlange221 @LeilaHormozi I don’t have kids.
1599206537364672512 2022-12-04 00:58:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yongfook This is a schedule I can get down with.   You’re a hero in the indie maker world, Jon.   Keep doing your thing.
1599205955278753793 2022-12-04 00:56:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidstache @LeilaHormozi I usually do the elliptical first and then just a few lifts. Nothing too strenuous.appreciate the guidance though. I’m no exercise expert by any means honestly.
1599191850669445120 2022-12-04 00:00:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AnthonyTumbiolo @LeilaHormozi Yeah no worries. the "?" was not intentional, just missed the period :)
1599191065684103168 2022-12-03 23:57:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AnthonyTumbiolo @LeilaHormozi google calendar?
1599189806478917632 2022-12-03 23:52:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vannlaniakea @LeilaHormozi Go for it!
1599189685296779264 2022-12-03 23:51:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Pig_Pic_ @LeilaHormozi The yellow blocks are flexible.
1599189552874168321 2022-12-03 23:51:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidstache @LeilaHormozi Happy to do something better, but I'm not an optimization machine.  Just enjoy the gym. Any recommendations welcome.
1599174246097248256 2022-12-03 22:50:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Chris_Schuering @LeilaHormozi Just a company I'm using to do video chats with customers.
1599171620580380672 2022-12-03 22:40:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls @LeilaHormozi Busy ≠ productive
1599171233689399296 2022-12-03 22:38:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TiMMRDesigns @LeilaHormozi I agree. Just presenting a different option.
1599170202830135297 2022-12-03 22:34:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bomenardco @LeilaHormozi When I was in college Elliptical machines were called EFX's (I have two back surgeries and can't run anymore) so I keep calling it EFX.
1599168674752917504 2022-12-03 22:28:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LeilaHormozi I run a one-person business that does $2M a year in net income, giving me roughly the same access to things that make people happy, work less than 40% of this, and I don't need to work myself to death to do it.   Here's a routine that won't kill you:  https://t.co/DF68RPW4V4
1599122661707112449 2022-12-03 19:25:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @peter_osborne I don’t like them.
1599086136470605825 2022-12-03 17:00:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RyanMHess I'm transparent about my revenue all of the time. I'm not sure what you're referencing 🤨
1599085875874660352 2022-12-03 16:59:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsBeauBurns We did, but The Netherlands had many more. And they capitalized.  We need a true world-class striker.
1599085703249285120 2022-12-03 16:58:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Same. I can't wait to go in 2026. I'll be there.
1599085325959434240 2022-12-03 16:57:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jkhasson Yep. Our effort was there, our skill was just overmatched. The Netherlands were extremely machine like and prepared.
1599082306479616001 2022-12-03 16:45:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Thank you. If you ever feel like I do that, call me on it. It's something I never want to do or be a part of.
1599072168574263296 2022-12-03 16:04:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour I think it's all about how you share it.  It's less about "look at me!" and more about "here's the success I've had by doing X, and here's what I learned, how you can learn it too, and how it can impact your business."   We need more female creators sharing this, IMO.
1599048628714164225 2022-12-03 14:31:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daviddomm Awesome!
1599035987924905989 2022-12-03 13:41:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JulieChenell WOW!
1599035944098635776 2022-12-03 13:40:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichelleJOkafor Boom! Congrats :)
1599034217035223041 2022-12-03 13:34:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Moimaere Good stuff!
1599032971914227712 2022-12-03 13:29:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ The Heineken one. Damn.
1599031859824185344 2022-12-03 13:24:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Different strokes for different outcomes, too.  My guess would be that you'd be more likely to share big wins for your portfolio companies. Is that true or am I off base?
1599030271113732097 2022-12-03 13:18:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eagermehul It generates interest in what you're doing.
1599030179158175744 2022-12-03 13:17:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Path_Of_progres Thanks, Idisi.
1599030133863563264 2022-12-03 13:17:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Shine a light on yourself. Nobody else is as likely to do so.
1599029825926144002 2022-12-03 13:16:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Not for me, no. Usually just lots of followers and website visits.   But maybe I'm in for a bad surprise in the future?
1599029639627669504 2022-12-03 13:15:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy Happy to share more of those. There are plenty.  Thanks for the feedback.
1599029381346664448 2022-12-03 13:14:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack Hell yeah :) Congrats man!
1599029330176184321 2022-12-03 13:14:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulineRiviere Those are true friends.
1599029279093760000 2022-12-03 13:14:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Craig_Gigged We all do.
1599028782345904130 2022-12-03 13:12:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you hit some incredible revenue milestone or big business goal, get on Twitter and tell the world about it.  Stop worrying about how people will react and start being your own one-person PR firm.
1599028182405218309 2022-12-03 13:10:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge I’ve already overspent 🤦‍♂️
1599027759589707776 2022-12-03 13:08:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup We don’t know each other that well, but I followed you for your intelligent insights, starting with your famous whiskey thread.   Much prefer that to the baiting. Looking fwd to more great content, Nick.
1599001987500376064 2022-12-03 11:25:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher @gmoneyNFT @benzistudio Woah. Massive congrats, Jack.
1598686938747359235 2022-12-02 14:34:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkShust Put your knowledge in a book and you're a romanticized author.  Put it in a course and you're automatically a scam artist.  Funny how that works, huh?
1598677911996858368 2022-12-02 13:58:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki The more you say no, the bigger your best yes can be.
1598677775849766913 2022-12-02 13:57:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Aiming for 18k steps per day. One of the great things my wife and I have done is walk everywhere on vacation. We'll do like 10 miles per day seeing a new city.
1598677616705372161 2022-12-02 13:57:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It's amazing the difference in outcomes between being obsessed and figuring that obsession out on your own, and doing something you hate for someone else.
1598673656107790336 2022-12-02 13:41:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder A very large margin, especially if you know how to handle it.
1598673575023607809 2022-12-02 13:40:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcuscelestin_ That will be in my newsletter tomorrow.
1598673122890235904 2022-12-02 13:39:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Well, I love it. Thanks for sharing.
1598672009805717504 2022-12-02 13:34:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki This is a fabulous quote. Where is this from?
1598670828492804098 2022-12-02 13:30:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Appreciate you, man. I think we need to get another call on the books, no?
1598670735186300930 2022-12-02 13:29:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom So do I now.   There was a time when I didn't.
1598670682275053568 2022-12-02 13:29:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oledoteth Hell yeah. Keep going!

1598669947462455296 2022-12-02 13:26:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @successcreatorr appreciate it.
1598669887634800642 2022-12-02 13:26:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ant_carlton For sure. I never want to be divisive (we've got enough of that), but I certainly share my strongly held opinions.
1598669741618495488 2022-12-02 13:25:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch Yep. It's about sticking to your guns.

1598369914020134966 2022-12-01 17:34:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Thank you man. Means a lot when people stop to say something nice. Keeps me going!

1598368686934528013 2022-12-01 17:29:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshdviner I appreciate that, Josh. That's what I'm trying do :)

1598368507082772495 2022-12-01 17:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Very cool. I didn't even need to see the image to know that walking gets my brain "juices" flowing.
1598368340958973959 2022-12-01 17:28:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thanks, man.  Likely going to double down on that in the future because of feedback like this.
1598368245152620544 2022-12-01 17:27:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert It was an interesting thing for sure. My intention wasn't to get one, and maybe that's why I did?

1598367635091103746 2022-12-01 17:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A growing Twitter audience is an asset to any entrepreneur.  And in November, Twitter growth fueled my business:  - 21.3M impressions - 24.5k+ followers - 1.8M profile visits  And a reply from Naval.  Here are the 7 most popular things I wrote last month:
1598307218310430723 2022-12-01 13:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz LOL
1598307024210722817 2022-12-01 13:24:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer That's a great lesson to teach.
1598306963946967043 2022-12-01 13:24:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom  https://t.co/ugUncOE98H
1598306726813523968 2022-12-01 13:23:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thestorystylist Ngmi
1598306705795960834 2022-12-01 13:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dtr_trading Never fails.
1598306022866751493 2022-12-01 13:20:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There's this whole group of people who complain about how everyone else runs their business or makes their money or services their customers or whatever.  When I dig into their business accomplishments, it's always the same.  A big, fat zero.
1598144877149425664 2022-12-01 02:40:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 @andruyeung @david_perell @chrishlad @waitbutwhy @nickgraynews @zehranaqvi_ @aaditsh @clifflerner @_rachelbraun @ShaanVP @harrydry @thealexbanks @nathanbaugh27 @jayclouse @CSMikeCardona @KateBour @amandanat @alexgarcia_atx @TrungTPhan @damn_ethan @stephsmithio @heydannymiranda Thanks man!

1597945741829623808 2022-11-30 13:28:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Wish I had this when I got a 1.9 my freshman year in college.
1597944061549510657 2022-11-30 13:22:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcotonycampos Thanks, Marco!
1597944006125973504 2022-11-30 13:21:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DanijelNagradic That's how I think about it, Danijel.
1597943921082236928 2022-11-30 13:21:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Same.
1597943885770424320 2022-11-30 13:21:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide I sure hope so, Hassan.
1597943860025778176 2022-11-30 13:21:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 It's just a reminder to myself as well. I also tend to be a workaholic. It's breaking the habit that's so difficult.
1597942668746792967 2022-11-30 13:16:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I have zero interest in optimizing my schedule to squeeze as much productivity as possible out of every day.  I'm not a solopreneur so I can "maximize time" and be "hyper-productive".  I'm a solopreneur so I can spend more time with my wife &amp; spend less time doing things I hate.
1597933692919300101 2022-11-30 12:40:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Love this. I might steal some of these tips for my own website. Thanks for the mention, Cole!
1597766722769276928 2022-11-30 01:37:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bgardner @jayclouse @jeremycowart This is insane. This got me so amped up.   Thanks for sharing!   I need to figure out what to do with this energy.
1597759566250639363 2022-11-30 01:09:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 @jayclouse Gonna make it happen.   I'll shoot you a note when I do.
1597758960500502529 2022-11-30 01:06:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @unboundedyou @jayclouse 100%. Would love that. Amplify critical voices.
1597757896523407363 2022-11-30 01:02:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanbarry I'd bet you can.
1597756841307492352 2022-11-30 00:58:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 @jayclouse Heck yeah. My #1 place I want to visit there. Looks like foodie paradise.
1597756760949161984 2022-11-30 00:57:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @willstew @jayclouse Small bets co! 🔥
1597753782552535041 2022-11-30 00:46:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheIndependentU @jayclouse I think so too. I'm amped up about this. Now to just make it happen...
1597753634229739520 2022-11-30 00:45:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wordsbysusmita @jayclouse I can't wait to come visit.   My wife has been to Mumbai and Pune, but I've never been.
1597752912205471744 2022-11-30 00:42:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trainedwright @jayclouse Intro away. I'm just kicking this idea around and would love to know about people who would be down. We'd pay for ourselves and make no money.  Needs to be someone down for that.
1597752593975218176 2022-11-30 00:41:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheFalanBlake @jayclouse I don't know yet, to be honest. I haven't thought this through entirely, but I know that African tech is growing like wildfire.  I want to be a part of that.  Need to learn more about what location would be most central.
1597751307670294530 2022-11-30 00:36:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse I want to go to Africa &amp; India with a pro photographer and do keynotes on social media growth &amp; entrepreneurship.  Then, I want to give everyone complimentary headshots they can take home to start sprucing up their profiles as a gift.  Might be 2024, but going to make it happen.
1597652424554168320 2022-11-29 18:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you keep bookmarking Tweets about solopreneurship but you've never built something of your own, maybe less bookmarking and more little leaps of faith.
1597635013482532865 2022-11-29 16:54:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe One thing I’ve noticed is self-sufficiency often separates the average from the excellent. Learning to learn on one’s own.

1597613105055666182 2022-11-29 15:27:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Cranking these out man. How many templates do you have now?
1597602386390179841 2022-11-29 14:44:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanjjmartin I neglected to include Stripe fees the first time I wrote that (stupid mistake) and then started to afterwards so it’s only fallen a few points.
1597602191283736577 2022-11-29 14:43:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Damn. Didn’t realize Moses Kagan owned that much real estate. Solid.
1597591888659611648 2022-11-29 14:02:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @therobertleonar I started by teaching people how to build SaaS companies in the healthcare technology vertical.  This whole "audience building" thing was never my intention.
1597589790295482370 2022-11-29 13:54:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Yep. Humanize yourself.
1597589744661454848 2022-11-29 13:54:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup  https://t.co/bftoomMoOs
1597589600737845250 2022-11-29 13:53:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanjjmartin I'm investing in more technology to automate. Margins go down, but my free time to invest goes up.
1597589421913935872 2022-11-29 13:52:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KrisOgrabek How much of my gross revenue is profit.
1597589372404396038 2022-11-29 13:52:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyjoeyjustice That's how I hope people think about my threads. THanks, Joey!
1597589314787217408 2022-11-29 13:52:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Thank you, Ben!
1597589290355417090 2022-11-29 13:52:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TaniaDiscovered I have very little figured out. Just tons of action, mistakes, failures, and a few wins that even it all out.
1597589197526896640 2022-11-29 13:52:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thank you. Fun doing it@!
1597589142455881728 2022-11-29 13:51:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Right? An often missed part of creating.
1597589086847569926 2022-11-29 13:51:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Thank you so much, Marcus :)
1597589048813834241 2022-11-29 13:51:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks I appreciate that, ALex!
1597584535482662914 2022-11-29 13:33:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup I don't wanna manage anyone. But I'd hear you out :)
1597583735880310786 2022-11-29 13:30:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Funny how showing up at the right party makes all of the difference.
1597583639227027456 2022-11-29 13:29:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach @dvassallo Thanks, Ashley :)
1597583507664277505 2022-11-29 13:29:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @floheitzmann Good problems to have.
1597583445697638402 2022-11-29 13:29:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup I'm trying to build a very small empire that allows me freedom and flexibility. Here's to achieving it (I hope).
1597583234258587651 2022-11-29 13:28:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder I try to practice what I preach. Glad it was helpful, man.
1597583169506746370 2022-11-29 13:28:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PrivatEquityGuy Thanks, man!
1597582504441028608 2022-11-29 13:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse @MariusCern And the mention!
1597581515399041034 2022-11-29 13:21:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1597581513054371843 2022-11-29 13:21:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Explore How to Use Community:  1. Get feedback 2. Get beta testers 3. Build an affiliate program 4. Get your first testimonials 5. Presell with a great discount 6. Get support for your content  And so on.  Monetization is now MUCH easier.  It's on you to get creative.
1597581510965661697 2022-11-29 13:21:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Finally, Monetize:  With a community of fans, monetization becomes a lot easier.  You basically have a "shopping mall". A captive audience.  People are looking to buy and you're the store owner.  No algorithm. No open rates. No friction.  Here are some things you can do:
1597581503512428544 2022-11-29 13:21:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Deepen Relationships:  Once trust is built, you can build deep relationships.  Use community to show a "behind-the-scenes" glimpse.  It's easier to invite someone once they trust your expertise.  Build your community of fans like @jayclouse    https://t.co/K4mNErFr0D
1597581501226426368 2022-11-29 13:21:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Learn to "Deplatform":  I started a newsletter because I wanted to "deplatform" my audience from social media to something I actually own:   An email address.  I've found this is the best way to guard against the unforeseen, like algorithm changes or being banned.  A must.
1597581492988805123 2022-11-29 13:21:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Leverage How-to Videos:  Don't like interviewing? Turn the camera around on yourself.  This is a great way to build trust by literally walking people through how to do something.  A master at this is @aliabdaal  Check out his channel below:  https://t.co/RCVxem7VxF
1597581490363289610 2022-11-29 13:21:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Start a Podcast:  If you don't want to write, start a podcast.  It shows your expertise, and you get the side benefit of connecting w/ interesting people.  Social proof!  Like how @dickiebush &amp; @nicolascole77 do it on the Ship30for30 podcast:  https://t.co/8PnCVFYhap
1597581487863484416 2022-11-29 13:21:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Write a Newsletter:  A newsletter is a great way to show your expertise.  Long-form allows you to go deeper &amp; more tactical in teaching.  You're showing people how your brain works.  I write to 61,000+ subscribers each week in The Saturday Solopreneur:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
1597581485644677120 2022-11-29 13:21:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build Trust:  Once you get discovered, you must build a deeper level of trust.  Not trust in the traditional sense of the word, but trust in your expertise.  That you actually know what you're doing &amp; can back up what you talk about.  This is critical.  So how do you do that?
1597581482276560898 2022-11-29 13:21:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Learn To Actually Add Value:  All of these pieces of content are intended to "add value" to the reader.  It's a phrase that is used so often, but people rarely understand how to approach it.  But, it's not a mystery.   Here's my favorite way to describe it, from @dvassallo  https://t.co/eIsm9qxbPe
1597581473556611074 2022-11-29 13:21:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Empathize With People:  Some content reaches your audience &amp; says, "I understand what you're going through" or, "you're not alone".   This content draws your audience in closer &amp; greatly humanizes an otherwise inanimate social media profile.  Like this:
1597581470964514818 2022-11-29 13:21:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Challenge People:  Content that challenges perceptions should get the reaction:  "I've never thought of it like that before", or... "What an interesting observation" or just... "Damn."  Open people up to a new perspective and win.  Like this Tweet:
1597581468422836227 2022-11-29 13:21:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Entertain People:  Teaching is helpful, but if you hammer your audience with teachings 100% of the time, you run the risk of boring them.   If you bore them, you might get tuned out.   You don't have to be a comedian. But switching it up can help.  Like this Tweet:
1597581465423937540 2022-11-29 13:21:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Teach People (educate):  The easiest way to get discovered is by teaching prospective followers &amp; customers how to do something.  These are "tactical" Tweets and threads that show off a bit of your expertise.  Share your knowledge!  Like this:
1597581463020617730 2022-11-29 13:21:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Get Discovered:  If nobody finds your thoughts/ideas, nothing else matters.  You want to start by creating valuable content where people are already consuming.  - Twitter - LinkedIn - TikTok - Etc.  There are 4 ways to do this:  1. Educate 2. Entertain 3. Challenge 4. Empathize
1597581460646543362 2022-11-29 13:21:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build a creator funnel:  This is a simple journey your audience goes through, increasing the chance they become a customer at each step.  It has 4 key parts:  1. Discovery 2. Trust 3. Relationships 4. Monetization  The first part is getting discovered.
1597581458117361665 2022-11-29 13:21:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In 2019, I had never made even $1 online.   3.5 years later:  - 468M+ content impressions on 2 platforms - $3.07M in online income at 94% margins - 5 successful revenue streams  Here are 15 short (but important) lessons from my journey:
1597556660285091842 2022-11-29 11:42:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uibreakfast @JacobSuckow @userlist @AthleticGreens @Kajabi Appreciate the feature here, Jane!

1597301717762478080 2022-11-28 18:49:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Good news. I have none of these.
1597290062395252736 2022-11-28 18:03:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The luckiest people I know have coincidentally been working hard for decades.
1597284298855714816 2022-11-28 17:40:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @katairobi @KateBour @SahilBloom @jackbutcher @Aazarshad @jayclouse Thanks, man!
1597226331833393152 2022-11-28 13:50:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew I like this formula. Copyright that :)
1597226213495300096 2022-11-28 13:49:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Yes. Consistency itself won't help you win long term. You have to be consistently better.
1597226084348592130 2022-11-28 13:49:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I try and incorporate 15-min after meal walks. I don't always do it, but when I do, I feel so much better.
1597225976358109188 2022-11-28 13:48:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Water up, alcohol down, body fat down.
1597225892119560196 2022-11-28 13:48:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It's funny that lack of experience keeps people from starting, because starting is the only way to change that.
1597225758354984962 2022-11-28 13:47:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Congrats! Big numbers. One of the best decisions I made last-minute was to do a BF sale. So glad I did.
1597225155440234497 2022-11-28 13:45:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx It certainly is, man!
1597225105134088193 2022-11-28 13:45:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Satisfied customers send me 30% of my business today.
1597222270488825858 2022-11-28 13:33:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Nailed it.
1597222200897327104 2022-11-28 13:33:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HellloHar @dvassallo Around $95k.
1597221344906973185 2022-11-28 13:30:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer I sure hope so, Bryan.
1597220974231171074 2022-11-28 13:28:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder It's funny because if you truly focus on helping people, the money comes...Win/Win.
1597220242782318592 2022-11-28 13:25:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adityatheverma Great comment. I appreciate that shift in thinking and had a similar one myself.
1597220141028487168 2022-11-28 13:25:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @degasel_ It's so underrated.  But as long as we keep glorifying scam artists, we'll be served a heaping helping of them.
1597220044840148992 2022-11-28 13:25:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch Not a bad take at all.  But, I just can't understand this "get money, screw people" mentality that so many have.
1597218622820478976 2022-11-28 13:19:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejoshuageelen Exactly, Joshua.
1597217979900760064 2022-11-28 13:16:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The most rebellious thing you can do is build a company that helps other people rather than one focused solely on top-line revenue like a lot of these money-at-all-costs buffoons we put on pedestals.

1596954177175179264 2022-11-27 19:48:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marino_training @DavidCrysler Enjoy! Thanks for being a customer.
1596860832121761795 2022-11-27 13:37:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thehowietan @OsipovDee @TymHartwich @sulaiman_botha @TimStodz @ItsKieranDrew @ByteSizedInvest @thestephanielau @singhcredible Thanks, Howie!
1596860453581254656 2022-11-27 13:36:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Getting rejected is often a blessing.  Self-rejection is almost never a blessing.  Be smart about how you treat yourself.
1596859949119782912 2022-11-27 13:34:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pathofvalues I still have a sore back :) 2x surgeries
1596859874226278402 2022-11-27 13:33:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide I've learned so much doing my own thing, that if I ever went back to work for a company, I believe I would be 100x more valuable than before.
1596858661733019648 2022-11-27 13:29:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @selfientdavid Thanks, David!
1596858184764989448 2022-11-27 13:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @selfientdavid Or just a really awesome lifestyle business.
1596858129169276928 2022-11-27 13:27:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pathofvalues That's not true.   That's a specific type of entrepreneurship. I've never had a sleepless night or a 19-hour day in 4 years running my own thing.
1596857988928933888 2022-11-27 13:26:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TomThorleyx The people who retort it are the people who know it's true but can't figure it out.
1596857901448318976 2022-11-27 13:26:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch Basically. Be excellent at something and you have significantly more options.
1596856118021873664 2022-11-27 13:19:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Correct. "More" passive was intentional. Nothing is actually passive no matter how much people claim it is.
1596855058842673153 2022-11-27 13:14:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch It gives you leverage and optionality that other employees don't have.
1596854985710620677 2022-11-27 13:14:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Thanks, Marcus!
1596854956140920833 2022-11-27 13:14:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel 2 streams. Active 9 to 5 and a more passive 24/7.
1596853699648831488 2022-11-27 13:09:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're one of the best employees at your company, you should damn sure be building something for yourself on the side.  When a company is willing to pay you for your knowledge and skills, the open market will likely pay you more.
1596838714655002624 2022-11-27 12:09:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thecolbykultgen Thanks, Colby!
1596549423210831872 2022-11-26 17:00:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @0xsash The whole Midwest. It’s a reflex you don’t lose.
1596545803354603521 2022-11-26 16:45:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheHunterBohm @0xsash Damn. I used the same clue (Ope!)
1596545584655114244 2022-11-26 16:45:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @0xsash If you bump into me in LeBron's home city, I might say "Ope!".
1596540540467564544 2022-11-26 16:25:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge This will go well with a rereading of Atomic Habits :)
1596518522443554817 2022-11-26 14:57:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Great thread. If you can get the partner part right you have a massive leg up.

1596130770900295682 2022-11-25 13:16:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Side note: Most people fail when they start their first online business.  The reasons they fail are exhaustive:  - Wrong niche - Wrong messaging - Wrong ideal customer - Wrong pricing structure - Wrong product offering - And more  Want to give yourself a better chance at success?
1596130768689954821 2022-11-25 13:16:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship 101:  Don't quit your job and then start building your own business.  Find 60 minutes per day to work on your business and use your job as investment capital.   Once your business is paying your salary, then consider going all in.  Almost always a better choice.

1595768792004452352 2022-11-24 13:18:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Imagine that next year on Thanksgiving, you're thankful because you finally pressed GO on that idea, product, service, community, or content that you've been constantly thinking about shipping.  Start tomorrow.  Eat some food and enjoy time with your family today.
1595570710143016961 2022-11-24 00:11:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao I love how many people are focused on positive reframes lately. Good thread, Wes 👍🏻

1595406469725396993 2022-11-23 13:18:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ It took me a long time to put health first, Matt. So glad I did.
1595405978119286784 2022-11-23 13:16:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are 4,950,000,000 internet-connected people waiting to get better at a number of different things.  Can you find 4 each day that will pay you $70 to learn one of those skills?  If so, you have a $100k+ business.  Not easy, but also not as daunting as you might think.
1595130313042432000 2022-11-22 19:01:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Great visual man. 🔥
1595115694768754704 2022-11-22 18:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Making money will never be enough of a driving factor to succeed as a solopreneur.  If you don't love what you do, who you help, and the problem you solve, you'll eventually burn out.  Find the one thing that gets you out of bed like a bat out of hell each morning and do that.
1595097478180872193 2022-11-22 16:50:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VladiWealth @Yannick_Veys Money is an outcome.  Without a real "why" you'll never make some.
1595087367722962946 2022-11-22 16:10:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Yannick_Veys Impact other people.
1595086291112431616 2022-11-22 16:06:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup I call this Shiny Outcome Syndrome.  I've always wanted the latter.  Then I see someone with 5 houses and I'm like, "Damn".  Gotta do it for the right reasons though.
1595079968945745920 2022-11-22 15:41:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Excellent breakdown, man.   Damn you look like a different guy. Congrats, Dickie!

1595049311397609472 2022-11-22 13:39:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Haha. I wanted to make sure it wasn't just some listicle of tools and instead a list of how I use them. Hopefully helpful!

1595049117188870147 2022-11-22 13:38:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mauraball @hypefury No.
1595048693018894336 2022-11-22 13:36:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Is it just a list, or how they are used? I think the latter is important.
1595048506925932544 2022-11-22 13:36:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Appreciate you, Ben!

1595047073388367872 2022-11-22 13:30:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @anthony_astbury @zapier I'd love one :)

1595046297220050950 2022-11-22 13:27:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Big learning curve. Worth it once you understand it though.

1594684254394503169 2022-11-21 13:28:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HellloHar It's up in the air right now.
1594684220554756099 2022-11-21 13:28:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexCookThinks It's never black and white, but people sell it that way.
1594684172098064386 2022-11-21 13:28:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tspeeg Thanks for reinforcing that I've made a good choice, Tyler.
1594684126547910656 2022-11-21 13:28:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje I like that, Sachin!
1594684044914184193 2022-11-21 13:27:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple Exactly. What would my mother think, is the lens I push things through.
1594683926114598912 2022-11-21 13:27:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @girish1729 I do. That's why I choose not to be an asshole.
1594683854983499780 2022-11-21 13:27:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YotisTonnelier I agree. I see all of this happening in real time on Twitter and it's so easy to see. But others fall victim.
1594683709831233536 2022-11-21 13:26:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona My man 🔥
1594683678533328896 2022-11-21 13:26:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets This business model never seems to be worth the energy, IMO.
1594682174778769410 2022-11-21 13:20:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I could build a much bigger online business by being divisive as hell, separating supporters into a group, and then selling them things that reinforce their feelings, but I'd rather make less and sleep peacefully.

1594431388631322624 2022-11-20 20:44:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SteveSweer @naval When I am 1/100th as popular or successful as he is. And probably not even then.
1594431200600506371 2022-11-20 20:43:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @callmehouck Lol. Now THAT is funny.
1594429916933918720 2022-11-20 20:38:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Today I messed around and searched back to Naval's 2013 Tweets, and I can confirm that we all start off just trying to figure this app out.

1594428190134792192 2022-11-20 20:31:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @francesco_srv I tend to agree.  But to help others, you have to win first (as you stated).

1594333064150278145 2022-11-20 14:13:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @grant_melson I'm not sure what that means.
1594331810112176128 2022-11-20 14:08:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder I agree. The energy is wonderful.  However, I've also never seen it more divisive.  There's a lot of silly little kids with no life experience on here.
1594327641947271169 2022-11-20 13:51:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brianondrako It's so good that you did.  Most of us start that way. Victims in everything.  Some people wake up and realize they have one life and it's time to get moving.
1594324822279987200 2022-11-20 13:40:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndreiCioloca Most big creators don't buy RTs.   They support one another.
1594324727765549056 2022-11-20 13:40:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Great comment, Dan.

1594324345735811072 2022-11-20 13:38:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Love it, Sachin.
1594324025119244288 2022-11-20 13:37:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool This is a great take.  People yell, "But X is unfair!"  Ok. Now what?   Either become an advocate for change or understand the rules and play. We need both people, but in-between doesn't do anything.
1594323763201339392 2022-11-20 13:36:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abrahamcslls Great idea :)
1594323111448657922 2022-11-20 13:33:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman Thank you, Tom.
1594323044801335296 2022-11-20 13:33:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx I used to read the news. Then, after awhile, I realized that it was all a big game.   So I stopped reading it and started playing it.  But no books. Any recs?
1594322863972003841 2022-11-20 13:32:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Yep.  There is so much out of our control that we can do very little about, and most people are focused 100% on these things. Not gonna help.
1594322167965093890 2022-11-20 13:30:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VisionAndSales I love this.
1594322092127883264 2022-11-20 13:29:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thestorystylist The rules are pretty clear. The work is the difficult part.
1594322018823852032 2022-11-20 13:29:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx 100%, Alex. It's up to you.
1594321209608372225 2022-11-20 13:26:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every unsuccessful person I know believes the game is rigged.  Every successful person knows the game is rigged and learns how to play.  It's cliché as hell, but your mindset is everything.
1594162586605404160 2022-11-20 02:55:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore Congrats my man ♥️

1594035787804413960 2022-11-19 18:32:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Dishoom was wonderful. In fact, all Indian food I are was great.   We went and saw Mary Poppins (even though I didn't want to) but I ended up enjoying the heck out of it.   Have a pint of real ale. Go to some great cemeteries!
1594035245992525825 2022-11-19 18:29:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmthn Even as a Buckeye I felt bad. Good kid, great runner, looked painful.

1593970219374022657 2022-11-19 14:11:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Haha. Too much!
1593970054433067011 2022-11-19 14:10:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Love me some Super. Beautiful sites!
1593967656419434498 2022-11-19 14:01:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore I've watched so many political news "gurus" on both sides twisting the facts so drastically to rile up their followers.  Why? Because they are incentivized.  It's not just the mass media anymore. Everyone is lying for personal gain.
1593966018690441216 2022-11-19 13:54:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @katairobi @mkobach @jackbutcher @amandanat @KateBour @Aazarshad Thanks, Robert!
1593965983252758530 2022-11-19 13:54:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DanBenoni Love that, Dan. This is the formula for success. A good balance is necessary.
1593964556195348483 2022-11-19 13:48:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill It isn't too shabby.  FYI - not forgetting our chat. Getting through the Holidays, interviewing some website vendors, and then will be ready to jam at some point.
1593964333339496448 2022-11-19 13:48:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Appreciate you, brother. Let's jam out on Zoom once the holidays are over.

1593960807830028289 2022-11-19 13:34:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore Everyone talks about how the mass media is incentivized to lie.  So are all of your favorite alternative news gurus on social media.  We've just switched to a different group of liars.
1593960450043088896 2022-11-19 13:32:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder I eat one McDonalds burger like every decade.  It's delicious and anyone who tells you it isn't is lying.   But I haven't had a regular soda in probably 20 years.
1593960223936593921 2022-11-19 13:31:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx The best. The true difference makers.

1593958066831077377 2022-11-19 13:23:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've found that a great measure of personal success is how many people thank you for theirs.
1593947482975006720 2022-11-19 12:41:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Thanks for the shout, my man.  You're doing great work here (and on Instagram).  Keep up the excellent work 📈

1593679228385595393 2022-11-18 18:55:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThomasLK2020 Good luck!
1593679118683488258 2022-11-18 18:54:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JOTA_uy @jamesreaco The question isn't "How many people did this work for?"  It's "How many people didn't this work for?"
1593662706044772354 2022-11-18 17:49:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Quitting your job to work full-time on something that has $0 in revenue sounds great in the movies, but in theory, you'll probably regret that decision.  It's much easier to walk a tightrope with a safety net underneath.
1593600020716085251 2022-11-18 13:40:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour I get pissed off when I meet my business heroes and they suck as people.
1593599894173925376 2022-11-18 13:39:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday You're a worthy follow anywhere, Ben.
1593599809033756672 2022-11-18 13:39:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Swanky, Cole.
1593599736267046913 2022-11-18 13:39:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder True story. No 6-pack here, but feeling damn good.
1593599002796335104 2022-11-18 13:36:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @patrigsby Love to hear that...
1593598233518940162 2022-11-18 13:33:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom @blakeaburge He's got a killer following and it's been fun experimenting with a bunch of stuff with him.
1593596540320448512 2022-11-18 13:26:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder @blakeaburge See you there, brother.
1593595372320047105 2022-11-18 13:21:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejoshuageelen Awesome, thanks Joshua.
1593595355412701187 2022-11-18 13:21:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JohnpaulBened09 See you tomorrow.
1593595319496966144 2022-11-18 13:21:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess See ya there.
1593595300777689092 2022-11-18 13:21:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Thanks. I'm trying to do more of them because people seem to dig them.
1593594123596042241 2022-11-18 13:17:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3 mistakes that drastically reduce Twitter sales:  - Complicated funnels - Low conversions rates - Unnecessary free products  Tomorrow, I'll share how I helped a popular Twitter creator 76x his thread revenue in ~30 minutes.

1593373391779766273 2022-11-17 22:39:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer @joserosado I'd argue Gary Vee drove familiarity around his personality and approach moreso than his topic.   But it's an interesting point for sure.  Other people are just early. He could be one of them.
1593372026152026112 2022-11-17 22:34:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coachmontel Thanks!
1593371480254988289 2022-11-17 22:32:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Bgpokerrant @joserosado Content.
1593371336554024962 2022-11-17 22:31:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Emilio_emb If you truly love something, you're always learning something new.  So the topic can stay similar, but the knowledge can change.   My two cents, at least.
1593371164390424577 2022-11-17 22:31:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado I'd bet if you go back in time he started more targeted and became broader. But he could also just be a highly effective outlier.
1593370472753909762 2022-11-17 22:28:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IntegrowSales Probably one of the best examples.  We watch the same shows because we're familiar with the characters.
1593370286291836930 2022-11-17 22:27:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Thanks. I'm just some random dumbass on the internet though.
1593370205169881088 2022-11-17 22:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado I think people want to be "interesting" therefore they talk about 30 different things.  But then you're never familiar.
1593369617367552000 2022-11-17 22:24:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you write to your audience about the same topic every day, you don't become boring.  You become familiar.   And people are attracted to what they are familiar with.
1593344853202636800 2022-11-17 20:46:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamuelSzuchan @itsNickPayne Thanks, Sam!
1593329556236148737 2022-11-17 19:45:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl Taking a 2-hour lunch with my wife.
1593313143568175105 2022-11-17 18:40:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PEfund_guy Agreed. Doing is learning!
1593303007445278721 2022-11-17 18:00:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyjoeyjustice Haha. :)
1593302944841089024 2022-11-17 17:59:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Tweet about it and ask people what they need help with. Get on the phone with them and find out exactly what would resonate.
1593302824686944260 2022-11-17 17:59:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_samps Thanks! I felt like it was basic advice but it seems to resonate like hell.
1593302373610422272 2022-11-17 17:57:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvolvedMindset_ Great quote from a great writer.
1593302340160962561 2022-11-17 17:57:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza Absolutely.
1593302317981474816 2022-11-17 17:57:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisshippPT Literally anything.
1593302287111307265 2022-11-17 17:57:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Get after it, fail, learn, try again.
1593301761652969472 2022-11-17 17:55:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're thinking about starting your own business, you don't need another Twitter thread or blog post.  Just start.  You'll learn 100x more by falling on your face than by reading someone else's advice.
1593257364135837696 2022-11-17 14:58:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina This is very good advice.
1593235866151157760 2022-11-17 13:33:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cryptolad1256 Haha :) Thanks!
1593235792188813312 2022-11-17 13:33:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge @jayclouse Loom + Pitch + a lot of swearing when I messed up.
1593235282421116928 2022-11-17 13:31:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cryptolad1256 GMI
1593235239996125184 2022-11-17 13:30:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LuxNarayan These hit the hardest every week for me.
1593234888316325888 2022-11-17 13:29:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Heck yeah. Glad it was helpful!@
1593234828211945474 2022-11-17 13:29:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PEfund_guy There are plenty of problems, I can promise you that.
1593234754610286592 2022-11-17 13:29:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It's tougher than it looks, but after a few months of figuring out what not to spend time on, it's a winning formula.
1593233932652515331 2022-11-17 13:25:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Welcome :)
1593233878969303040 2022-11-17 13:25:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theleoalexandru Thanks!
1593233863589126148 2022-11-17 13:25:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jjtalentcoach For sure.   Every yes to someone else is a no to my wife.
1593233791078010882 2022-11-17 13:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Congrats on the official!
1593233171566546944 2022-11-17 13:22:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1593233169544790016 2022-11-17 13:22:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> And my normal day ends up looking like this:  - 7:15a to 8:15a: Interact on social media for 60 minutes - 9:00a to 10:30a: Go to the gym with my wife - 11:00a to 1:00p: Eat lunch &amp; write - 1p to 4:00p: Creative time
1593233162200838144 2022-11-17 13:22:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What's left?  Once I'm through these questions, there are 4 non-negotiable pieces of work that end up on my calendar:  - Interact on social media for 45 minutes with my audience - Go to the gym for 90 minutes - Write for 90 minutes - Attend client calls
1593233153799335936 2022-11-17 13:22:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What can I delegate?  Delegate any work that is leftover, that is less valuable than the time it would take you to do.  Delegate to a VA (or someone on Upwork) using process documents &amp; videos that show them exactly what to do.  Here's my process:   https://t.co/RY5XsPt4yT
1593233151882575872 2022-11-17 13:22:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What can I automate?  Next, I look for places to insert automation.  An example is my coaching business.   I used to have an elaborate back-and-forth to onboard clients.  Now I use Kajabi + Zapier + Airtable.  “Can this be automated?”  Yes: Automate No: Move to next question
1593233149940703234 2022-11-17 13:22:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What can I simplify?  Look for simpler processes or a reduced  scope of work.  Like my digital course.   I could have made it an elaborate production, but instead, I recorded videos in one take with no editing.  “Can this be simplified?”  Yes: Simplify No: Move to next question
1593233143217078272 2022-11-17 13:22:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What can I eliminate?  Each week I find:  - Upcoming meetings I shouldn't have booked - Podcasts I don't need to be on  - Favors that aren't urgent - And more  I simply ask myself:   "Does this move me closer to my most important goals?"  No: Eliminate Yes: Move to next question
1593233140763398147 2022-11-17 13:22:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you replicate this simple process, you'll:  - Eliminate context switching - Reduce the risk of burnout  - Improve your focus  Plus, you'll dramatically increase the time you spend working on the most important parts of your business  Here are the 4 questions I ask:
1593233132613865474 2022-11-17 13:22:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to save yourself 40 hours of unimportant work this month:
1593228919791964160 2022-11-17 13:05:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado @JoshuaLisec @dvassallo @EdLatimore Thanks, man!
1593076039194116096 2022-11-17 02:58:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer Thanks, Chris!
1593066777847934977 2022-11-17 02:21:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @macmagx Would love to see it. Appreciate it! 🔥
1593066096197763075 2022-11-17 02:18:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @macmagx Yep, definitely in play in the future. Thanks!  Will likely transition in 2023 + 2024, but super top of funnel focused for long game action.  1M+ followers and 150,000+ subs then some interesting changes coming.   Appreciate it, Mac!
1593063756900323334 2022-11-17 02:09:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @macmagx To be clear, I'm not opposed to business improvement. I love growing.  It's that I get a bunch of people who email me telling me how I could grow a big team or build a community and 10x.  But, I'm just interested in that.  Ok - spill the beans on the email list. I'm listening 😂
1593048209643175936 2022-11-17 01:07:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl Testimonial is one of my favorite softwares. Changed my business.
1593031815597813760 2022-11-17 00:02:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidshestrin @blakeaburge He made it publishing one thread. Give it a read on Saturday and see if you can steal some lessons.
1593023867618209792 2022-11-16 23:31:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic @blakeaburge Heck yeah. Thanks, Zlatko!
1593023799469182976 2022-11-16 23:30:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @raymond_green @blakeaburge You're a lot like Blake. You're open to suggestions, and take action.  It's easy and fun working with fellas like you.
1593023643009024001 2022-11-16 23:30:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel @blakeaburge I very much appreciate him being open to it.
1593020507095732224 2022-11-16 23:17:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thanks for being an awesome person to work with. I love when people just take action, my friend.
1593020148516294656 2022-11-16 23:16:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup @blakeaburge Thank you :)
1593019015622164480 2022-11-16 23:11:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're interested in getting the recap, make sure you're part of my newsletter here.  You can read it in 2.5 minutes.   https://t.co/X3l2wg6fme
1593019014275825664 2022-11-16 23:11:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Here's the high-level summary:  1. Simplified the sales process. 2. Made valuable free things affordable, but paid. 3. Passively suggested people buy them.  The result was a massive increase over his previous process.
1593019012816187392 2022-11-16 23:11:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Last week, I spent 30 minutes chatting with @blakeaburge about his business.  In the next 48 hours, he made $2,243 online.  Just drafted up a recap of our conversation and will be sending it out this Saturday.

1592939850411360256 2022-11-16 17:57:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamZanto This is the reason I love it, Sam.
1592939753703292928 2022-11-16 17:56:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markstrefford I certainly wouldn't
1592939621276872704 2022-11-16 17:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @howiesommerfeld Thanks, Howie!
1592939562837643264 2022-11-16 17:56:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @torreydawley Same :)
1592939522979168256 2022-11-16 17:55:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @byhazellim Totally. This is the true for sure, Hazel.
1592939472756559872 2022-11-16 17:55:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder 100%.   It's a time:revenue ratio I keep my eye on.
1592937675350310923 2022-11-16 17:48:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People often reach out to me and say things like, "you could scale 10x if you just..." without realizing that I'm not interested in scaling 10x.  A great lifestyle business is a perfect balance of quality time &amp; quality revenue.  Don't get distracted by other people's purpose.
1592922824988950528 2022-11-16 16:49:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe So true.  MBA is a perfect example.   Someone who just graduated with an MBA knows significantly less about business than a HS dropout with a thriving business.
1592891955184562176 2022-11-16 14:46:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Walking after meals is big for me. 15 min after dinner is my new thing.
1592891798510505984 2022-11-16 14:46:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge The template library is coming together nicely!
1592878616836194306 2022-11-16 13:53:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki And the last day of the quarter comes around faster than you think (especially as a CRO).
1592878486116605953 2022-11-16 13:53:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Every social media platform is as good as your ability to curate what you get.
1592878306923274247 2022-11-16 13:52:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe You will experience all of the emotions whether you are striving for greatness or doing literally nothing. Might as well go on the journey with the more enticing outcome.
1592875488577744897 2022-11-16 13:41:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jjeffrose Thanks for the nice mention, Jeff!
1592875244142092290 2022-11-16 13:40:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realwesfoster That's correct.
1592875174160138245 2022-11-16 13:40:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tspeeg Everyone is an impostor until they aren't.  Then they hit a new level of growth and learning and it comes back again.  Good news is that you can use it as fuel to get even better!
1592872849479700480 2022-11-16 13:30:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SWComposer Every time you hit a new growth area, it creeps back. It's a good thing though, not a bad one.
1592872688279699456 2022-11-16 13:30:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 True story, Cole.
1592872656755642368 2022-11-16 13:30:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder It's comforting knowing that some of the best of the best doubt themselves, Dan.
1592872061609050112 2022-11-16 13:27:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Oh, man. This looks dope.   Going to buy it when it comes out. 💰
1592871586801291264 2022-11-16 13:25:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @talktoterryco @DanNelken Correct. I've never met a mediocre performer with impostor syndrome.
1592871506199347200 2022-11-16 13:25:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randomrecruiter I recommend the exact same thing.
1592871378725707777 2022-11-16 13:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom @AdamMGrant That Adam Grant is a smart guy. Love that reframe.
1592871208684761088 2022-11-16 13:24:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Yep. I've never met a mediocre performer with impostor syndrome.
1592871094267965440 2022-11-16 13:23:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman One of the most freeing realizations I've had, Tom.
1592870492393787397 2022-11-16 13:21:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The best way to deal with impostor syndrome is to realize nearly everyone is an impostor.
1592637712028565504 2022-11-15 21:56:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl I’m about to mute myself.
1592635965176045569 2022-11-15 21:49:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshMcKain I threw that in years ago.
1592632106722951168 2022-11-15 21:34:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarolyneHahn Watch me.
1592631970764181504 2022-11-15 21:33:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imrancader_ I’m pretty sure I’ll be alright.
1592631791847776256 2022-11-15 21:33:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill I’m Tweeting this from a spa. About to get a 60 min massage while everyone else is yelling about someone named SBF.
1592629955758002176 2022-11-15 21:25:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Yannick_Veys It’s not even that I’m ignoring “him” per se. I just don’t care about the whole saga.   It’s a soap opera I’m not interested in.
1592629203845156866 2022-11-15 21:22:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RealEstateMaxi Apparently very easily.
1592628790773321729 2022-11-15 21:21:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Stealing.
1592628703426940928 2022-11-15 21:20:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Yannick_Veys I don’t understand it because I don’t pay attention.
1592628169219375104 2022-11-15 21:18:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My productivity hack is ignoring everything related to Elon Musk and crypto.
1592627838670483456 2022-11-15 21:17:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness Making money is hard as can be.   But the actual path is more simple than most people think.   It’s just often overcomplicated by people who need you to feel confused in order to buy their products.
1592627336188657665 2022-11-15 21:15:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jason_Kovalenko I’ve written a ton of free articles about that. You might find them helpful.    https://t.co/LJYGj6Y9gb
1592626875893182465 2022-11-15 21:13:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisTaudien @TobiasE97319503 @dvassallo I’m certainly not the first person to build a one person business but I think solopreneur was a word I chose to claim early and it’s gotten significantly more popular since. I’m happy it has.
1592626306449297410 2022-11-15 21:11:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CassandraLRosen A few ways:  1. Tactical products: literally watch then do.   2. Create a unique solution: my content os is a system I created that is uniquely different.   3.  Market them differently: short, affordable, accessible, meant to be enjoyed by anyone in any country.
1592588331451551745 2022-11-15 18:40:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ericasmyname This made me laugh so hard. Thank you :)
1592585296347947008 2022-11-15 18:28:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cnu Good call.
1592585241738489857 2022-11-15 18:28:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LeadAuthentic Write about it on social media.
1592580112528347136 2022-11-15 18:07:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gid_dev An intersection of what you care about, what you know a lot about, and what a bunch of people want to know a lot about...  That sounds like a good start.
1592579951685177344 2022-11-15 18:07:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona On the money, Mike.
1592579636709711872 2022-11-15 18:05:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom @AlFaslivingroom This 👆🏻
1592578986999435264 2022-11-15 18:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to think of an idea:  1) Think of a product (very challenging)  2) Solve your own problem (an easier way)  3) Create unique content that lets you own a micro-topic with very limited competition. Then, listen for problems from your audience. (IMO, the best way)
1592578848893566977 2022-11-15 18:02:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher @visualizevalue Looks excellent, man.  Congrats.
1592578843084148736 2022-11-15 18:02:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Wow. Looks incredible.
1592577926868140033 2022-11-15 17:59:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cpatrascudev @nielsmouthaan @dailytimeapp I used @paritydeals - it works great
1592577802481860608 2022-11-15 17:58:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AugmentAllWays Thank you!
1592577715349389314 2022-11-15 17:58:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sabrinassantiag Read, write, draw, listen to comedy, etc.
1592577625511587841 2022-11-15 17:57:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlFaslivingroom @SahilBloom Those few adjustments are usually key though :)
1592515077474816001 2022-11-15 13:49:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This is basically how to get good at anything. Such a valuable Tweet, Dickie!
1592514969337495554 2022-11-15 13:48:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew The joke is on those people though. It might get you followers, but it won't get you customers.
1592514701224644608 2022-11-15 13:47:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour When you learn to compete with your prior self, you find yourself in a pretty intense dogfight every day. That's how you grow.
1592514549051052032 2022-11-15 13:47:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore I do the same, but find 2 opposing viewpoints. Best way to get a true gauge of what's true and what isn't. It requires you to actually think!
1592514235124580352 2022-11-15 13:45:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday The best start to a morning routine is a good night's sleep.
1592511859625955330 2022-11-15 13:36:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer Definitely a heckuva good start.  But at some point you'll have to answer the question, "Why Chris's business?"
1592511703983464448 2022-11-15 13:35:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom And do it in a way that is both different, but also uniquely yours. The more the solution and business scream "Justin" the more people seem to enjoy it. Bring your own style.
1592510732788273159 2022-11-15 13:32:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MyLearningNotes 100%, Justin. That's how it's done.
1592510631319478272 2022-11-15 13:31:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thehowietan Exactly, Howie.
1592510598679789570 2022-11-15 13:31:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Wow. Great comment, Daren. I love that approach.
1592506724547809281 2022-11-15 13:16:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If your business solves the same problem as everyone else, has the same solution as everyone else, and uses the same language as everyone else, then you're a commodity.   Find a non-obvious solution to an obvious problem and you'll win more business at a better price point.
1592233668281774081 2022-11-14 19:11:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ppcClickShark I don't think lead magnets are bad at all.  I just see so many people using LM + complicated email funnels to position at $29 product.  It's like "dude, just offer the product at that price point."
1592219761169014784 2022-11-14 18:15:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ScottWissing I don't think lead magnets are bad. I just don't need multiple lead magnets and big email funnels to sell something that is $50.
1592219667908771847 2022-11-14 18:15:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NewPrediction I just talk about the problem I solve every day and then tell people that they can go to my website to learn how to solve it. I have free things they can read, no email address needed, and they can purchase products if they want more help. I let them decide when they are ready.
1592219366174511104 2022-11-14 18:14:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @happyfridavid Anything less than $200.
1592219308431912960 2022-11-14 18:13:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheIndependentU So much. Just solve people's problems and position a high-quality product at the right time.
1592216596684058624 2022-11-14 18:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's amazing how many people create free lead magnets and complicated email funnels to sell an inexpensive product because they think that's what you're supposed to do.  If your product is affordable, just write content and then position it for people to buy when they are ready.
1592155368213598215 2022-11-14 13:59:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @byhazellim Great point, Hazel.
1592152361858142208 2022-11-14 13:47:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Great stuff here, Teddy. Process focused is so important. That will often yield the outcome you're looking fort.
1592147849235795970 2022-11-14 13:30:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yishaiback Sometimes it's just the last person standing that wins.
1592147775239901184 2022-11-14 13:29:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Perfect analogy, Dan.
1592147702275772418 2022-11-14 13:29:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AhmedSaeedBJ Yep. Look to compound. That's the real power.
1592147621795201024 2022-11-14 13:29:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TomScourfield1 Way more time. And it doesn't work.
1592147578904530944 2022-11-14 13:28:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexjjohnson Never been so true.
1592145982875369474 2022-11-14 13:22:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People fail to build a meaningful business because they are impatient.  There are zero get-rich-quick schemes that work.  If someone is selling you that and you're buying? You're the fool.  Building something great takes a long time, so please approach it with that mindset.
1591898878646915074 2022-11-13 21:00:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo 😂
1591898400433541120 2022-11-13 20:58:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo My wife ran the lunch program at the startup we met at.   Every employee’s first day: “Free lunch? Awesome!”  6 months later: “I’ll only eat organic Irish butter from grass fed cows on my filet. Order that moving forward.”  This is not a joke.
1591864154234982402 2022-11-13 18:42:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AngryTomtweets @thatroblennon @thesyedhuq @francis_oleh @albadawee @jonbrosio @Copywriting_Dad @waronweakness @WrongsToWrite @ItsKieranDrew @joserosado @dickiebush Thank you!
1591840750634942465 2022-11-13 17:09:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki “The pet rock WAS a great idea…”
1591803745935187968 2022-11-13 14:42:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Simplicity wins. Every single time.
1591798080818802691 2022-11-13 14:20:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore I also get frustrated by people who think using an "outlier" mentality.  They find the biggest outlier available in a situation and then use it to combat practical advice.
1591795067202801667 2022-11-13 14:08:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lincolnpolson @thedankoe @writingtoriches Thank you!
1591792318004482051 2022-11-13 13:57:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen @InspiredByWayne So happy it was worthwhile for you, Dennis!
1591792225293565958 2022-11-13 13:56:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ppcClickShark I don't even get that complicated, tbh.  Often, it's when they finish a certain action in one of my products that I recommend another product related to that specific section.
1591791678280589313 2022-11-13 13:54:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @torreydawley @JoshMiles @EdLatimore @micsolana @amandanat @ISO50 @balajis @foundmyfitness @ZubyMusic @FitFounder @caroljsroth @zachhomol_ Thank you!
1591788692821381121 2022-11-13 13:42:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @seempaq 100%.   It's a win/win when you stop thinking about "how can I make more money?" and start thinking about "how can I get this customer closer to their ultimate goal?"
1591788358824472577 2022-11-13 13:41:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew It's amazing when you think you understand something, only to find out you can't write about it clearly.  Time to learn more about that thing.
1591787793235472384 2022-11-13 13:39:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Alcohol → H2O
1591787654378532864 2022-11-13 13:38:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It's also one of the best ways to stay focused on creating an intentional life.  The moment you hire someone, you become a manager of people. After managing thousands of people in my career, I don't want to go back at this time in my life.
1591786460683931651 2022-11-13 13:34:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSuddenWealth Awesome. I love hearing that, Jacob!
1591785916347346944 2022-11-13 13:31:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Fahimbinreza1 I don't. I offer them products along the journey that I think will be helpful at that specific time.  They get to make the choice.
1591785753679646721 2022-11-13 13:31:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Thanks so much, Marcus!
1591785691410993152 2022-11-13 13:30:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Remains true to this day.
1591785197686902785 2022-11-13 13:28:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Exactly. It's not just "I made more money".   It's, "this impacted my customer in such a good way that the natural outcome is additional revenue over time."
1591784494171930624 2022-11-13 13:26:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I went from running a mediocre business to a successful one when I began maximizing customer lifetime value.  I didn't add random upsells.  I started offering more of the right products to the right people at the right time in their journey.  Happier customers, better business.
1591583467904839681 2022-11-13 00:07:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki @elonmusk @acquiredotcom @acquire Get this man his handle!
1591583357648965632 2022-11-13 00:06:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thePhilRivers @pauldm Not necessarily. Some people write really long newsletters that are excellent.   But many people write long newsletters that could have been 80% shorter.
1591574856407330816 2022-11-12 23:33:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pauldm I've read newsletters that are too long, but never one that is too short.   Just something to think about no matter where you end up.   (also not suggesting long newsletters are bad - they can be great for certain topics/writing styles)
1591555968483328000 2022-11-12 22:18:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano I drove through Cincy on my way to my new place in NY.   This place was awesome. Insane burgers.    https://t.co/3LbHoqbMiW
1591529166281007104 2022-11-12 20:31:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Want to chat about this when you get back upstate?
1591425489310482434 2022-11-12 13:39:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MrPassive_ Yep. Done over a long period of time.
1591425433731731458 2022-11-12 13:39:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jdhawl That's how a great mentor should act.
1591425361706991616 2022-11-12 13:39:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thehowietan Exactly, Howie.
1591425316115091456 2022-11-12 13:38:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulineRiviere Such a huge game changer, Pauline.
1591425281734381568 2022-11-12 13:38:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill Very mythical. The perfect thing has usually been imperfect for a long time.
1591425215695052802 2022-11-12 13:38:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets A very real thing.
1591425188763406338 2022-11-12 13:38:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide 100% it's underrated.
1591425159306612738 2022-11-12 13:38:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Just keep trying things. When something finally works, do more of it.
1591424919371649024 2022-11-12 13:37:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge My new Saturday morning money sheet 📈
1591421352858247169 2022-11-12 13:23:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In business, it's rarely picking the right mentor, software, course, or community that makes the biggest difference.  It's usually just action, analysis, and iteration.  If you're procrastinating, waiting for "perfect",  just push something out today and let the ride begin.
1591115934353489920 2022-11-11 17:09:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sultanofcopy Thank you!

1591115558053109762 2022-11-11 17:08:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PEfund_guy Correct

1591107226919473156 2022-11-11 16:34:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The internet is like a convention where anyone can be a speaker.  1% of people grab the mic, 9% of people actively listen, and 90% of people mill around talking shit about those on stage.  But, the stage is where the good stuff happens.  So,  grab the mic and start talking.

1591062198142767107 2022-11-11 13:36:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Haha. I'm definitely going to use that moving forward. That's such a great comment, Blake.
1591060732892053506 2022-11-11 13:30:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @igorbenic I appreciate it, Igor. Love to hear it.
1591060655661989889 2022-11-11 13:29:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Thank you, Dan! I appreciate that, man. 🔥
1591059798984101890 2022-11-11 13:26:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Dude, that's awesome. You'd better share.
1591059731174813696 2022-11-11 13:26:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess So appreciative, man. Thank you.

1591059106462408706 2022-11-11 13:23:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PEfund_guy It's a pretty simple process that most people don't think about, IMO.
1591059051181649925 2022-11-11 13:23:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thank you, man. Looking fwd to sharing it.
1591057623784251392 2022-11-11 13:17:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Last year, I figured out that I could spend $40.93 and 10 minutes of my time to predictably generate $7,500 in sales.  It's revenue most people already have on their computer.  Tomorrow's newsletter breaks down the whole process.  Join 59,774 subscribers:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG

1590781469500510208 2022-11-10 19:00:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshdviner 100%, Josh. These are legit

1590769390294773761 2022-11-10 18:12:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Go to Burial Beer. Wonderful stuff.
1590768964975546368 2022-11-10 18:10:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 It is.  With 1,000 true fans you can make a living almost 100% of the time.
1590768796481949696 2022-11-10 18:10:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realwesfoster They are really hard to keep up in the long term. And you can't necessarily add more without exhausting yourself.  For example, increasing any of the numbers would be killer.
1590767074699145216 2022-11-10 18:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you want go deeper on this subject, check out my article:  "4 Steps to 1,000 True Fans"   https://t.co/CB3IDOYpgW
1590767072702873601 2022-11-10 18:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  1. Think like a niche "streaming service"  2. Become a Category Pirate  3. Tell a story worth following  4. Do unscalable things
1590767070836396040 2022-11-10 18:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Do unscalable things:  Here are some of the things I've done:  - Published daily to social media, often 2x-3x per day.  - Replied to every comment, every morning for over an hour.  - Engaged with 15+ people's content every morning for over 3 years.
1590767068273692672 2022-11-10 18:03:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tell a story worth following:  Like the founder of a  company, you need a story that compels your audience.  The story can't be fake. It's your real story but stitched together in a fashion that makes it exciting to follow along.  Use this formula:  https://t.co/36gGZJG8un
1590767061592334336 2022-11-10 18:03:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> - What is something everyone believes to be true, that you don't?  - What is something nobody in your niche is talking about, but should be?  - What are the biggest mistakes people are making, that they are oblivious to?  - Why are you someone worth following when others aren't?
1590767059436466176 2022-11-10 18:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Become a Category Pirate:  Don't blend in. Stand out.  And the easiest way to stand out is through non-obvious content.   Non-obvious content is about bringing a new thought process to your niche.   Something that makes you radically different.   Ask yourself these questions ↓
1590767057142165504 2022-11-10 18:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Think Like a Niche Streaming Service:  It's critical that you focus on helping a specific person looking for specific advice.  The more helpful your content is to a specific audience, the more likely they are to find your "signal" in a world of generic "noise".  Stay narrow.

1590736659154620416 2022-11-10 16:02:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Question #3 is one of my favorites. Whatever channel that is, double down.
1590703871424606208 2022-11-10 13:52:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour I have with some, like Microacquire and Groundswell, because I really like Andrew Gazdecki and Brendan Short.  Some people want to stay in stealth.  Others are through a fund, and then some others completely offline :)

1590702575812481024 2022-11-10 13:47:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_samps @matt_gray_ Matt and I know each other quite well.
1590702348254711808 2022-11-10 13:46:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch I don't care about going viral.  I care about going deep with the people who I want to attract.
1590700248099262464 2022-11-10 13:37:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TomBeemSays That's awesome to hear because it's my goal.  I always try and write as though I'm speaking to one person.  Appreciate you saying it!
1590699719537623040 2022-11-10 13:35:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @polak_jasper Great stuff, Jasper.  Thanks for the kind mention!
1590699441929203715 2022-11-10 13:34:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Really good question.  I'd say write more, publish more, and move faster.  I started slow because I was afraid, like so many people. But the answer lies in the feedback, not the fear.
1590699242641031169 2022-11-10 13:33:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Yep. And the people who aren't along for the ride?  That's ok too.
1590698927732707328 2022-11-10 13:32:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Yep. Each little post is your knowledge marching out into the universe to teach people and make people aware that you exist. Wild.
1590698713609297921 2022-11-10 13:31:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MylesMarino1 Look at this mess.  https://t.co/m7j52I4Kij
1590698267817709568 2022-11-10 13:29:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nerita_ll Nice!
1590698243649720320 2022-11-10 13:29:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic That's awesome. I love getting those little notes.
1590698085029937152 2022-11-10 13:29:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Good stuff, Matt.  Take care of yourself. Because nothing else matters if you don't.
1590697835791781888 2022-11-10 13:28:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer Yes sir. Started in late 2018.  Time flies :)
1590697350866927616 2022-11-10 13:26:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @craigshoemaker Thanks, Craig!
1590697304268603392 2022-11-10 13:26:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PEfund_guy I never post and ghost in the AM. Maybe sometimes in the PM.
1590697240967774210 2022-11-10 13:25:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue Love to hear it, Sean.
1590697217643667456 2022-11-10 13:25:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg I love that way of thinking of it, Greg.
1590697181924626432 2022-11-10 13:25:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Haha. Thanks.  I don't even know what being a guru means, I just know if people put it in quotes when referring to you, it's probably nothing nice.
1590697055256686592 2022-11-10 13:25:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Love it, Blake. Keep going, brother.
1590695819769937920 2022-11-10 13:20:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 years ago, I pressed publish on my first piece of content.  Since then I've met incredible people, invested $100k+ in friends, &amp; closed $3M in business.  To this day, I have no idea what each piece of content will do, but I publish knowing the vast upside.  I hope you will too.
1590695459471110145 2022-11-10 13:18:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse I like to build new things that I get excited about. So I sort of wait until I'm excited about something, and then I build it.
1590694443635867651 2022-11-10 13:14:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse 55% of my revenue comes from a product I built almost 18 months ago.  It just keeps selling. Pretty interesting, huh?
1590441607882768385 2022-11-09 20:30:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoeydeWit_ That's a great quote.
1590441563556937728 2022-11-09 20:29:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MindOfVilla Tons. Is there a specific question I could help answer?
1590441487728201728 2022-11-09 20:29:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @byhazellim Nailed it.
1590441451259064320 2022-11-09 20:29:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UnderstoryBard Sure is.
1590441415632244736 2022-11-09 20:29:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert I quit my job to start writing on social media :)
1590439885777047554 2022-11-09 20:23:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You won't build a great business without a little risk.  Those at the top of their fields nearly always took some small risks.  - The idea - The execution - The go-to-market - The advertising plan  Don't be catastrophically foolish.  But take some well-calculated chances.
1590435399486541824 2022-11-09 20:05:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Maybe that's true, but it's not my job to decide who can and who can't, so people should try if they want to become one.
1590435218179395584 2022-11-09 20:04:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ishverduzco @wes_kao @thedankoe @ericasmyname @KateBour @matt_gray_ @ccmarce_writes @jspujji @ShaanVP @SahilBloom @Codie_Sanchez @dickiebush @TrungTPhan Thanks for the shout, brother!
1590435195962163201 2022-11-09 20:04:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Thanks man!
1590435062801387520 2022-11-09 20:04:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tillwaytweets Weird. Haven't heard of that problem as of yet!
1590434230680489984 2022-11-09 20:00:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanbaugh27 Same!
1590433846562263041 2022-11-09 19:59:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alukerowley Maybe 15 minutes or so? I use inspiration from other great writers to learn faser.
1590433503916994560 2022-11-09 19:57:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp @WatkinsTBen Thank you, fellas. So glad you were pleased. Makes my day 🔥

1590382235827331072 2022-11-09 16:34:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theandreboso Correct.  It's much easier to walk the wire when you have a safety net.
1590342506507821056 2022-11-09 13:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina I like Lo-Fi + wine.
1590341905803792384 2022-11-09 13:53:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Snagging it now. Nice release man :)  Congrats on the 100lb lost!
1590338558522720256 2022-11-09 13:40:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iam_Riichard @jessedanyusufco Nobody is reading them now.
1590338464343478272 2022-11-09 13:40:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith I very much appreciate that man.  If it makes anyone feel better, I worry that I'm not adding value every single time I hit "Post".   But, it usually works out. Keep posting :)
1590337838746595333 2022-11-09 13:37:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Heck yeah, Daren. Glad this could be helpful.

1590336149138309121 2022-11-09 13:30:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder 100%. The hook is so much easier after writing the body copy.
1590335936852029447 2022-11-09 13:30:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TomatoTEEJ I write at the intersection of what I know about, what I care about, and what my audience wants more of.
1590335816454221824 2022-11-09 13:29:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Oh, stop Mr. #1.

1590334685770489856 2022-11-09 13:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessedanyusufco Kept going, honestly.  I just had to lose my ego.

1590333657679626244 2022-11-09 13:21:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1590333655624318976 2022-11-09 13:21:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  Step 1: Write the body using headers and white space  Step 2: Use a specific call to action to tell readers what to do.  Step 3: Write compelling hook lines by using my recommendations.
1590333653455982592 2022-11-09 13:21:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Use past vs. present to compare change:  (Again, using #'s help)
1590333651207835649 2022-11-09 13:21:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Use eye-catching numbers to share an accomplishment:
1590333647499976704 2022-11-09 13:21:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tell people what they'll get, &amp; address a common objection:
1590333645231132672 2022-11-09 13:21:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Finish your writing process by creating your Hook Tweet:  We're at the last, but most important step of writing Tweet threads.  The "Hook".  Without a good hook, nobody stops to read, engage, comment or Retweet. Ouch.  Here are 3 (of several) hooks that work for me:
1590333641720299528 2022-11-09 13:21:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tell the reader exactly what they should do:  - Follow you - Join your email list - Retweet the first Tweet - Read another thread you wrote - Buy a product that is relevant to the thread  Here's an example of how I usually end my threads:  https://t.co/XfSKZtFJt7
1590333631091789824 2022-11-09 13:20:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Write out the call-to-action next:  So many people write good threads and then forget to tell the reader what to do at the end.   This is missed opportunity to drive reader action.  Think about the possible actions you want at the conclusion of your thread and then...
1590333627161780226 2022-11-09 13:20:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Each "body" Tweet should:  - Have a header - Include enough white space to make it easy to read  A header simply tells the reader what to expect in the Tweet they are reading.  White space is the space between lines so that it's easier on the eyes.  Here's an example of both:  https://t.co/0rkeSrCSef
1590333611437264896 2022-11-09 13:20:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Start by writing the body:  The body of the thread is the information you're attempting to convey.  If you're not sharing anything of value, even the best "hook" won't get people to engage, comment, and Retweet.  Scrolling a thread is tiring, so the format is everything.
1590333609327591424 2022-11-09 13:20:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Here are the biggest mistakes I see:  - Lacking a good “Hook Tweet”. - No "headers" on the "body" Tweets. - Way too wordy, and no white space for reading. - No clear call-to-action or call-to-conversation at the end.  Let's fix that.
1590333606932623362 2022-11-09 13:20:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Writing high-quality Twitter threads is the fastest &amp; easiest way to pick up followers who are interested in your expertise.   That leads to more email subscribers &amp; customers.  Unfortunately, most people don't have a writing process for threads, so they make common mistakes.
1590333604390920199 2022-11-09 13:20:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm the 7th most-saved Thread writer of all-time on Readwise.  My threads have been read 98M+ times, and led to 224k+ new followers.  Here's my entire writing process in &lt; 2.5 minutes:
1590325968522317824 2022-11-09 12:50:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado Great thread, Jose.  Tons of useful information here. Thanks for shouting out my landing page as well.   Appreciate it.
1590149847679918082 2022-11-09 01:10:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmandaMGoetz Super lame.  I deal with this on LinkedIn every single day and often it's from folks with decent followings.   At least change a word for goodness sake 😂
1590115432010514433 2022-11-08 22:53:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylesporter I don't do much heat mapping honestly.  I look at visitor to conversion mostly, which probably isn't perfect, but a decent proxy.

1590051972362575873 2022-11-08 18:41:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Beautiful comment, Kieran.
1590051402503847936 2022-11-08 18:39:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @recostseg Probably a silly question, but is this for commercial real estate only or can you use this for residential real estate?
1590050762528366592 2022-11-08 18:36:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In life, if you are fortunate enough to know exactly what you want to do, then just start doing it.   There's no better way to reach mastery of something than by living it as early as possible.
1590016938000121860 2022-11-08 16:22:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewglynch @danieldessinger Yeah. 2.9% + $.30 to Stripe and then some software for my website, newsletter, etc.
1589979188442058753 2022-11-08 13:52:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni Great stuff, Kurtis.   This is something I've been obsessed with for a long time.
1589975170789576704 2022-11-08 13:36:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Damn. Good point, Dan.
1589974970461216769 2022-11-08 13:35:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere I hope so, Pranshu.
1589974054735597569 2022-11-08 13:32:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMakfinance Definitely. That's a given.
1589974030299279360 2022-11-08 13:32:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @digital_didact For sure.
1589974017943162881 2022-11-08 13:32:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sean_deloughery Yep. Great question to ask yourself:  "Why did I buy this?"
1589973912708079616 2022-11-08 13:31:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejacobshipley Yep!
1589973893548498945 2022-11-08 13:31:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue I'm always tinkering with mine, Sean.
1589972314078138368 2022-11-08 13:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This is just one way to write better landing page copy.  Want a few more?  Here's a short guide to building better landing pages for your business.  You can read it in less than 4 minutes and apply it instantly.  I hope you enjoy it.   https://t.co/MrFFMdJG6G
1589972311888699393 2022-11-08 13:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Here's a better example:   "Learn how to make your first stock market investment in just 10 minutes (with zero fees)"  - What: Make their first stock market investment - How long: 10 minutes - Objection handler: With zero fees.  I 100% understand what I'm getting here.
1589972309753806848 2022-11-08 13:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Let's start with a bad example:   "Learn how to invest in the stock market."  This outcome is pretty nebulous.   - How much? - How many? - Can anyone do it? - How long will it take?  Those questions are unanswered, plus I have a million objections.
1589972301747027969 2022-11-08 13:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A great landing page is critical to generating revenue.  The problem?  Most people stink at writing them.  Here are 2 quick examples that might help:
1589804760479109120 2022-11-08 02:19:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danieldessinger 3M * 94% margins = $2.82M
1589771010320044033 2022-11-08 00:05:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher Can confirm. More attempts for me, but each one very simple.
1589752712992010243 2022-11-07 22:52:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @klauscallum0g @ishverduzco You realize that they need to prove their identity, right? The way you described it is not how it works.
1589752590010814464 2022-11-07 22:52:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eidlisz_ben @ishverduzco Having my driver's license.
1589752464580177920 2022-11-07 22:51:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyOmarr @ishverduzco Having my driver's license.
1589730834508308482 2022-11-07 21:25:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @billyfrazr Excellent GIF. Well done.
1589730411210735616 2022-11-07 21:24:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @findmyke That's what I did first. And I would do it again that way.  Contrary to popular belief, I didn't come out of the womb with LinkedIn followers.  I wrote daily for 9 months to grow it.
1589729926542168064 2022-11-07 21:22:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarketingCaddy @SaveToNotion I think so too, Walt.
1589729758224732161 2022-11-07 21:21:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond Thank you, my man.

1589729626456485889 2022-11-07 21:20:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ishverduzco Same here, man!
1589729416703541249 2022-11-07 21:20:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Thank you, my man!
1589729369869914113 2022-11-07 21:19:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshMcKain I was still employed, yes. I started writing about 9 months before I left my job.
1589729163065245696 2022-11-07 21:19:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Hunckler Thank you, Matt!
1589729055641079809 2022-11-07 21:18:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao I appreciate that, Wes!

1589728794037796864 2022-11-07 21:17:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Thank you, my man. Almost done with The Second Mountain! Moved to audiobook at the gym.  Might be my all-time favorite.
1589700048648310784 2022-11-07 19:23:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMakfinance @EdLatimore Knowledge is a commodity.   Motivation + action is power.
1589699926170034176 2022-11-07 19:22:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tereza_Finance 10 months.
1589699823921659905 2022-11-07 19:22:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector @amandanat @theKevinShen You're an awesome interviewer and your newsletter is one of VERY few that I allow into my inbox. It's so short, but so good.
1589699435537502208 2022-11-07 19:20:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tambuildsthings Just something new each day. I had zero processes at that point.
1589699229983047680 2022-11-07 19:20:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TeamApocalyps16 Yes.
1589699129378471937 2022-11-07 19:19:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I love when that happens. My best replies always become my best Tweets.
1589698814709223425 2022-11-07 19:18:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timgabedesign Not yet. The move got in the way. It's still planned though.
1589698586308390912 2022-11-07 19:17:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Thank you, my man :)
1589698555073433600 2022-11-07 19:17:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EastCoastJoe I just pony up and pay, unfortunately.
1589698332427186176 2022-11-07 19:16:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour @o0Aditi0o @randfish @amandanat @TheCoolestCool @ThatChristinaG @Dmurr68 @Aazarshad Thank you, Katelyn.  In a period of great anger and vitriol, niceness still works.   I promise :)
1589698126876536832 2022-11-07 19:15:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theroborourke I have a part-time VA that works 20 hours per month.

1589697813755363333 2022-11-07 19:14:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alekzan I didn't mean I quit building SaaS. I mean, I no longer advise SaaS companies.
1589691292543373312 2022-11-07 18:48:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @christiancollrd @FitFounder It is! The Kerhonkson Rail Trail.
1589689070086942720 2022-11-07 18:39:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Help people win personally, and they will help you win professionally.
1589688970492919808 2022-11-07 18:39:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Mastery of a revenue generating skill means never being out of the game.
1589688586894467076 2022-11-07 18:37:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Yep. Feeling this.  https://t.co/fHVxQZl88E
1589688065823571976 2022-11-07 18:35:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Last week for me.  https://t.co/oFsffYN7ZM
1589687381309157376 2022-11-07 18:33:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ishverduzco I will pay so that the 120+ impostors I've had to report over the last year are finally a thing of the past.
1589687066794795009 2022-11-07 18:31:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore My favorite way to learn is to experience something myself, fail miserably, and then go to people who have done it with specific questions.   It keeps me from asking vague questions like "How do you do this?"
1589686810279825410 2022-11-07 18:30:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thesamparr Goodness. Congratulations, Sam.   That's some serious ear-time.
1589686530322333699 2022-11-07 18:29:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SievaKozinsky Looking at it another way, most people will fail because they never try.
1589641984188518400 2022-11-07 15:32:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 You should talk about how you build your content schedule.   Always interested in how other folks do it.
1589641721654415362 2022-11-07 15:31:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 As someone trying to get through this process, this is super helpful. Thanks man!

1589617383911882753 2022-11-07 13:54:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @farez One at a time, but continue shipping and bolting on.
1589617286666944512 2022-11-07 13:54:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CicmilJovan It depends. Sometimes 20. Sometimes 70.  But, I'd say on average I try to work about 5-6 hours per day.
1589617183201853441 2022-11-07 13:54:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Thank you, Jay. As are you. I think your content is A+
1589615947882852352 2022-11-07 13:49:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bartek_matoga Outside of what I covered above, what else can I tell you, Bartek?
1589615854748340226 2022-11-07 13:48:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @msskwan A small course called The LinkedIn PLaybook I sold for $50.
1589615761382776832 2022-11-07 13:48:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @byiliakarelin Go check me out :)
1589615711001145344 2022-11-07 13:48:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @april_storynook So many things differently. I don't even know where to begin.  But, I would have started Tweeting a year earlier or so.
1589615607770943488 2022-11-07 13:47:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew I just share the opp in every newsletter, and put it on my website. You could Tweet about it or join ConvertKit's sponsor network too.
1589615477575540736 2022-11-07 13:47:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotechAna I'm so glad, Ana!

1589615280485203969 2022-11-07 13:46:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ I don't have any freelancers. I have a part-time VA.  I hired @BrendanHufford to do some SEO work that was super helpful early on.  Other than that, it's just me and my wife.
1589612746261553154 2022-11-07 13:36:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ranbirsinghlive It was very important. It helped pay the bills, Ranbir.
1589612671258984450 2022-11-07 13:36:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelrhalcomb I just lost interest.

1589612400059199488 2022-11-07 13:35:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack Gone back to the drawing board, shipped more content, listened more, and shipped something new.
1589612309697425410 2022-11-07 13:34:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Richard_andey Maybe. I could have sold it, but that felt gross to me for some reason.
1589612256903704576 2022-11-07 13:34:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joonian Oh, I am.

1589609061296746496 2022-11-07 13:21:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @janetacarr Haha. Thank you, Janet.
1589608993135112192 2022-11-07 13:21:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge I'm glad I did, Blake. I'd be talking about SaaS sales today if I didn't, which isn't as interesting to me.
1589608754139787266 2022-11-07 13:20:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiharikaSodhi Thank you so much, Niharikaa!
1589608698816917505 2022-11-07 13:20:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chris_gensheer Nope. A smaller course before that called The LinkedIn Playbook.  It was $50.
1589608590574112768 2022-11-07 13:19:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PEfund_guy I hope so.
1589608563030528001 2022-11-07 13:19:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tspeeg Thank you.   I think those both played big roles in the journey, Tyler.
1589608339176292353 2022-11-07 13:18:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @byhazellim The latter. Although I tried to stick with what I knew Re: SaaS
1589608275368349697 2022-11-07 13:18:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GoogleAdsElite Thanks, Ian!
1589608256930185218 2022-11-07 13:18:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni I think so too, Kurtis.
1589608231659540485 2022-11-07 13:18:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup I like to think so.  Hopefully this wild thing will keep going, Nick.  Appreciate your support.

1589606751158116352 2022-11-07 13:12:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1589606747819458562 2022-11-07 13:12:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm not sure what's next yet, but I'll be sharing as I figure it out.  If this was helpful, feel free to give me a follow.  If you have any questions, ask away.   Happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading.
1589606745193811968 2022-11-07 13:12:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A few last notes of potential interest:  1. I no longer do anything SaaS-related.  2. I don't do any paid advertising of any kind.  3. I don't have any employees, but I do have a wife that helps me stay very organized.
1589606742911946752 2022-11-07 13:12:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Finally, here's what my business revenue looks like:  Products:  $1.54M Consulting: $1.17M Community: $130k MRR: $84k Sponsorships: $76k
1589606739959218183 2022-11-07 13:12:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 20/ Added sponsorships  With over 60k subs, I can charge for each issue to be sponsored.  I have 2 slots per issue, per week, that sell for $1,250.  Now each weekly newsletter is paying $2,500, and people are getting their brand and business in front of a ton of readers.
1589606733160251392 2022-11-07 13:12:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 19/ Started a newsletter  In January of 2021, I launched my newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.  I was determined to deliver one piece of actionable advice each Saturday AM that could be read in 4 minutes or less.  In the last 11 months, I've grown it to 60k+ subs.
1589606730916368389 2022-11-07 13:12:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 18/ Added MRR  I noticed that each week I was spending time creating content templates for myself.  What if my audience wanted those too?  I tested it as a $9 upsell on each course.  8 months later it has 1,700+ subscribers.  Almost $14k MRR from something I was already doing.
1589606728148127744 2022-11-07 13:12:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 17/ Created a 2nd digital course  I was doing a podcast with @dickiebush and @nicolascole77 about how I built a system for writing content.  The 500+ people on the call seemed to be amazed by it.  That led to my 2nd course, The Content Operating System.
1589606726214582272 2022-11-07 13:12:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 16/ Reinvested my time  With way more free time now, I decided to start Tweeting.  Using what I knew about growing on LinkedIn, I was able to hit 75k followers in about 6 months.  This provided a new channel to build more stuff.  So I did.
1589606724125745155 2022-11-07 13:12:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 15/ Made a difficult decision  I loved my community but realized that it didn't work with my personality.  It was a $15k MRR business, but I felt like I had to be "on" 24/7.   That wasn't the life I wanted to build.  15 months after starting it, I made a decision to shut it down.
1589606721542029313 2022-11-07 13:12:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 14/ Built a community  As sales picked up, my interest in consulting faded.  I was doing $2k per day in info products and wanted to run with that.  I opened a private community for creators and charged $199.   Those who completed my course were prompted to join.
1589606719528779778 2022-11-07 13:12:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 13/ I began creating an army  At the halfway point of my course, people are encouraged to leave a testimonial and sign up for an affiliate program.  I built the same automation at the conclusion of the course.  I now have 800+ affiliates that have generated $110,000 in revenue.
1589606717473652737 2022-11-07 13:12:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 12/ Marketed aggressively  With 100% of my LinkedIn content focused on audience growth, and a product directly related to that content, sales took off.  My previous course grossed $75k in 15 months.  The second version has grossed $186k in 3 months.  Next up...
1589606715225513984 2022-11-07 13:12:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 11/ Tripled down  After the course was outdated, people started asking for a new version.  I rebuilt the course, but this time charged $150.  The earlier $50 price was my "trust tripwire".  I charged $50, delivered 100x worth the price, and built trust w/ a loyal customer base.
1589606712931237892 2022-11-07 13:12:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ Ran with it  Over the next 15 months, I sold about $75k of the course.  I posted about audience building on LinkedIn and found other ways to continue to land consulting clients. (VCs, news sites, blogs, SaaStr, etc)  Even though it felt confusing, I continued to run with it.
1589606710469181440 2022-11-07 13:12:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/ Made my first product $$  I put the product for sale on Gumroad on April 16th, 2020.   In the first month, I made $10,482.   I was shocked.  I now had my first digital product, but it was in a totally different niche than my service business.  Honestly, this confused me.
1589606708397195264 2022-11-07 13:12:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Tested a hypothesis  I had organically grown to 20k+ followers on LinkedIn &amp; people wanted to know more.  I had a hypothesis that this would be an easy info product I could create &amp; sell.  I put together a short course for $50 (more on price later) &amp; wrote posts about it.
1589606706295803904 2022-11-07 13:12:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Kept my eyes and ears open  Something really interesting happened.  In an attempt to find common problems to productize, I started rereading my LinkedIn DMs.  I had some repetitive questions about SaaS sales, but I also had an inbox jammed with questions about LinkedIn itself.
1589606704282492929 2022-11-07 13:12:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Reduced my time  With new rates, I could have worked the same and made 2x as much.   Instead, I chose to work 50% of the time and make the same.  I used that extra time to figure out how to scale income that was more automated.  My goal had always been to get my time back.
1589606701711384577 2022-11-07 13:12:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ 2x'ed my rates  With a well-defined niche, some happy customers, and testimonials, I 2x'ed my rates.  I started creating more content that was even more targeted. This led to more conversations with ideal-fit prospects.  I said no to any company outside of my niche.
1589606699131965440 2022-11-07 13:12:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Found my ideal customers  Inside your customer base is more signals.  What are the commonalities between the customers you love &amp; those who love you?  Mine were early-stage SMB SaaS in the healthcare space. A space I was experienced in &amp; loved.  That became my ideal customer.
1589606696724332546 2022-11-07 13:12:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Built a service business  My experience building SaaS was resonating. So I began creating more and more content about that.  Founders sent me DMs asking questions.   I responded to every single one.  Once I had prospects in my funnel, I started consulting.
1589606694543396872 2022-11-07 13:12:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Honed in on signals  Inside all of that noise was some signals.  Sometimes I bombed, and sometimes I struck a chord.  The more I looked at what resonated, the more I doubled down.   This allowed me to understand what people cared about.  So, I kept writing &amp; talking about it.
1589606692072919044 2022-11-07 13:12:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Created lots of noise  When I was just getting started, I looked at attention as my friend.  I wrote content every day before I even had a business, just to find my voice.  I started on LinkedIn.  I shared my thoughts &amp; observations about building a SaaS unicorn as the CRO.
1589606689262780417 2022-11-07 13:12:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Today, my little one-person business crossed $3M in revenue.  It took 1,187 days, I ran zero ads &amp; operate at a 94% margin.  Here are the 20 steps of my wild &amp; strange journey:  Hope it's helpful to someone.  [🧵 thread]
1589590366680150016 2022-11-07 12:07:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MattiSchroder @JohnIsBuilding I price my products what I would feel comfortable paying for them.
1589588739785109504 2022-11-07 12:01:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiharikaSodhi @jonbrosio @abhishekshah173 Thank you, everyone!
1589453192051720192 2022-11-07 03:02:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @Jay_Sapovits @JohnIsBuilding Always appreciate your support, Mike :) 🔥 Truly.
1589450520028401665 2022-11-07 02:51:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jay_Sapovits @CSMikeCardona @JohnIsBuilding I'm working towards being egoless.   I don't want to have to "win" an argument or "be right" about something.  I just do what I think is right, and if people decide I'm not right for them or their description or whatever, that's cool too.  No hard feelings.
1589449895551078400 2022-11-07 02:49:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kaineoio @JohnIsBuilding You work on many things and then let the data guide you. Or you experiment a lot, see what works, and then do more of that.
1589395753117442048 2022-11-06 23:14:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rakejoh @JohnIsBuilding It was a function of being forced.   I started having panick attacks and couldn't function.   I saved between 3-6 months of runway, I can't remember how much specifically.
1589388488625250304 2022-11-06 22:45:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @incremental1st @JohnIsBuilding A company valued at $1B or more.
1589372093799751681 2022-11-06 21:40:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @JohnIsBuilding I don't know. I'm not trying to fit into a dictionary description, to be honest.  My VA works 20 hours per month, and is managed by another company, so if that disqualifies me, I'll start writing about duopreneurship :)   I have no employees. That's how I think about it.
1589369511295143936 2022-11-06 21:29:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wander_wealth @JohnIsBuilding Kim told John that Brenda and Tommy are seeing each other.
1589368005066387456 2022-11-06 21:23:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mustafa_kamal @JohnIsBuilding Feedback from followers, time with my wife, my parent's pride, tipping awesome servers $100 because I can, buying trips for my friends, etc.   No one thing. Many things.
1589365935260852224 2022-11-06 21:15:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JohnIsBuilding I built a team of 150+ people at a unicorn and I now operate a 1-person, 7-figure business.  (Not a flex, just context)  They each have pros &amp; cons.  I like solopreneurship because I'm at a stage in my life where I don't want to manage anyone.  Happy to answer any questions!
1589358643740573697 2022-11-06 20:46:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oliviercantin Smart. I hadn't thought of this.
1589304222239297537 2022-11-06 17:10:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_bigfield @tibo_maker Thank you!
1589260105350283265 2022-11-06 14:15:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @akhilnchauhan @tibo_maker @alexisgrant @thelindazhang Thank you!
1589259593062158337 2022-11-06 14:13:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ I would add anything that @sivers writes to this list.  He's possibly the most practical writer I've read with regard to building things the right way, and sustainably.
1589257931177893888 2022-11-06 14:06:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse @JamesClear @herfirst100K @Codie_Sanchez @sivers Just found this via @jspector newsletter.  Killer Tweet I would have otherwise missed.   Thanks, Josh + Jay!
1589256753103147008 2022-11-06 14:01:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TrentAnders0n Thank you man!
1589253224091066370 2022-11-06 13:47:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki The Founder's story markets to both your customers but also your future employees.
1589252996239659016 2022-11-06 13:46:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush You ever mix the espresso and topo chico? From my understanding, it's a big thing in Japan. I tried it and loved it. Thoughts?
1589252623349256195 2022-11-06 13:45:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore Some people are so risk-averse that they never take even the smallest of risk which, in turn, is the riskiest thing of all.
1589250666715021312 2022-11-06 13:37:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Unless the specifically agreed to be a part of your newsletter, I would not.
1589247156640452609 2022-11-06 13:23:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndreasPetker It's true.
1589247103901249538 2022-11-06 13:23:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess I've been in the room that makes the decisions. It's often just spreadsheet driven.
1589247021919059968 2022-11-06 13:23:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SchusterDev Always.
1589246997122682880 2022-11-06 13:23:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Even 15 minutes per day taking small steps can be helpful.
1589246136896081920 2022-11-06 13:19:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abrahamcslls True story, Abraham.
1589246043228893186 2022-11-06 13:19:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThatMarket3r That's a positive outlook on a tough situation. Good for you, Moritz.
1589245935347175425 2022-11-06 13:18:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyAmna1 Thanks, Amna.
1589245752211308545 2022-11-06 13:18:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ideaeconomy @growthcurrency @AaronCrocco @jspector @CSMikeCardona Sure thing. I say stupid things all of the time. I'm glad people are at least listening 😂
1589245537852817408 2022-11-06 13:17:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If the wild uncertainty at tech companies reminds us of anything, it should be that we're all useful until suddenly we aren't.  If you're fortunate enough to have full-time employment, now is the best time to start preparing for this "what if" scenario in your life.
1589220314713829377 2022-11-06 11:37:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @ideaeconomy @AaronCrocco @jspector @CSMikeCardona If you share the podcast link, I could also probably help clarify.  Back to the original point, I'd say at the beginning of anything you do, you must work hard.  It's how you transition from brute force to predictable systems that matter (IMO) how you transition from that.
1589220046051516417 2022-11-06 11:35:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @ideaeconomy @AaronCrocco @jspector @CSMikeCardona I don't work 12 hours per day, although occasionally I may if I need to.   I work between 5-9 hours per day.  I may have misspoken or been using the number as a way to exaggerate i.e. sometimes I'll say "80-hour workweek" as a crutch to describe someone who works too much.
1588965500520103936 2022-11-05 18:44:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @benclarkdaily @SahilBloom  https://t.co/bR3mzhtV6R
1588912503400321025 2022-11-05 15:13:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonbrosio @dickiebush @matt_gray_ @jackbutcher @NiharikaSodhi @ItsKieranDrew @ericasmyname Thanks, Jon!
1588887800992014336 2022-11-05 13:35:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Time is the only nin-renewable asset. Much easier to understand at 41 than 21. Wish I had recognized it earlier.
1588874540889034752 2022-11-05 12:43:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @perfexcellent Someday I may very well do that.  And I don't believe I owe the world a proactive explanation, although I'd likely provide one.
1588870923364765696 2022-11-05 12:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PEfund_guy I'm almost 42 and I constantly think about what the 2nd half of my life will be like.  Do I want to be a better version of who I already am or a different version entirely?   Fun question to ponder.
1588870680841687040 2022-11-05 12:27:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Always be curious, but also open and willing to change.
1588869521930358784 2022-11-05 12:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @I_Am_GKennedy Beautiful.
1588869447733121024 2022-11-05 12:22:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby @sgmpodcst Yep. I said something similar here:   https://t.co/7wFuhJuMUC
1588869257223622657 2022-11-05 12:22:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew It starts with the mindset of "getting it right" instead of "being right".
1588868304680423424 2022-11-05 12:18:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sgmpodcst @jappleby That's problematic, IMO.  Just say, "I used to think this, and now I think something different."  It's easy when you don't have an ego.
1588868164787798016 2022-11-05 12:17:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii 100% true.
1588868091030962176 2022-11-05 12:17:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bfillmer Totally fair, but we don't owe the world a proactive explanation every single time we shift our perspective.
1588867852442173440 2022-11-05 12:16:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BlackLabelAdvsr I'm not necessarily talking about conviction. There will always be things we believe in and don't waver on.  I'm talking about forming new opinions over time when presented with new information.
1588867662121426947 2022-11-05 12:15:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessedanyusufco For sure.
1588867626079760384 2022-11-05 12:15:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheTechOasis1 100%. I learn that things I was sure about are things I'm no longer sure about as I grow older.
1588867543900381185 2022-11-05 12:15:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Sure fire.
1588867526767038464 2022-11-05 12:15:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby "You said something different 5 years ago. You're now a fraud."
1588866801517187072 2022-11-05 12:12:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> We tend to dunk on people who contradict themselves over time, but it's the people who never evolve their thinking that scare me the most.
1588623403941969921 2022-11-04 20:05:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder @josephamiller I'm not talking about powerlifters. Just the average dude at the gym dropping weights, throwing shit around, and yelling a lot.   Also - don't take me too seriously. I'm just some random guy on the internet having a little fun.
1588592774106206209 2022-11-04 18:03:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder  https://t.co/l7nV8kRRDU
1588553237661192192 2022-11-04 15:26:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Personally, I don't like gym "screamers".   We get it. You lifted heavy.
1588553041107730434 2022-11-04 15:25:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore Plus, it's significantly less fun.  Being around miserable people is just...miserable.
1588516893237055488 2022-11-04 13:01:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PEfund_guy Depends on what you're looking for.  I think LinkedIn is better for b2b or b2c business, but Twitter is a much easier place to network effectively.
1588516640098058242 2022-11-04 13:00:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Take action and then let the results think for you.
1588516580538867712 2022-11-04 13:00:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Say yes to everything, then say no to everything.
1588516509655175168 2022-11-04 13:00:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew The simplest and most straightforward path to solopreneurship. You nailed it.
1588516390037848064 2022-11-04 12:59:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Understanding your customers is something that will never go out of style.

1588516102195347458 2022-11-04 12:58:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder I listen to non-fiction sometimes. Knocks me right out.
1588516016585412609 2022-11-04 12:58:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe I say the same thing 1,000 different ways, and people still thank me each day for the new idea.

1588506983828946945 2022-11-04 12:22:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge You absolutely can, Blake. I think this one will be really relevant to you, honestly.

1588505412722212864 2022-11-04 12:16:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In October of 2021, I jumped from LinkedIn to Twitter.  I leveraged my 125k followers on LI to start growing really fast here.  The secret?  - Inward momentum - Compound action - Outward momentum  Tomorrow, I'll break these 3 things down for 57,694 people:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG

1588225023457763331 2022-11-03 17:42:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joanmichelson 100% me.
1588224918893871106 2022-11-03 17:41:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danielkenitz I remember this comment specifically. It's the one where I asked for the best personal site, right?
1588224802355126272 2022-11-03 17:41:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_templin @gumroad Just sell and have the post-action deliver a PDF letting people know it will be out in a month.

1588224275042934784 2022-11-03 17:39:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SievaKozinsky Thanks, Sieva!
1588224210769514499 2022-11-03 17:38:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao Yep. It's a lot like making money.  That's not a skill. Solving problems is a skill. Money is the outcome.
1588224037498589186 2022-11-03 17:38:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TomConnan I sure think so. I know a lot of designers doing well. Artists seem to be similar albeit different.
1588223928316661764 2022-11-03 17:37:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amirsanroberto Thank you. I'm just a normal screw-up like anyone else.
1588223790647021571 2022-11-03 17:37:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Thank you , Katelyn :)
1588223741833744384 2022-11-03 17:37:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ParkerRex Find the intersection of where your customers hang most and where you like creationg, and start there.
1588223585130205184 2022-11-03 17:36:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Yup. Consistency is always the toughest part!
1588223498551435264 2022-11-03 17:36:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reach_growth A balance for me.  I usually have 60 things in the queue, but often I publish what comes to mind naturally.
1588223403844141056 2022-11-03 17:35:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lukesophinos Thank you, Luke!
1588223381773623297 2022-11-03 17:35:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni Same, Kurtis!
1588215234309021697 2022-11-03 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5 steps to a one-person business:  1. Talk to people 2. Understand what they need 3. Create content that helps them achieve 4. Service them one-on-one to learn solutions 5. Package those solutions into a product over time  Talk → understand → create → service → productize
1588151189799051265 2022-11-03 12:48:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @FitFounder @KateBour @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup Start your own "smart" group with 4-5 friends. As you all grow, you'll naturally attract other smart and interesting people.  The definition of smart is up to you! :)
1588148881359077381 2022-11-03 12:39:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nerita_ll @blakeaburge It's actually a Hamlet haha.
1588148825767673858 2022-11-03 12:39:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Joseph__Seifert Awesome. Keep going, brother :)
1588148175394799617 2022-11-03 12:36:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @KateBour @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup Same here, man. Been a blast getting to know you.
1588147900281929731 2022-11-03 12:35:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Same. I live in a town of 555 :)
1588146786920796160 2022-11-03 12:31:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Ain't that the truth.
1588146713830871041 2022-11-03 12:30:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday Thank you, Ben. Looking fwd to getting to know you soon. I owe you a rescheduled call.
1588146613662490627 2022-11-03 12:30:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza Nice, Antonio!
1588146577100644352 2022-11-03 12:30:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue Simple stuff, Sean.
1588146557244809218 2022-11-03 12:30:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Right back at you, Sahil.  In-person, upstate NY meetup in 2023.
1588146349723324416 2022-11-03 12:29:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ It's 100% the good-looking headshot. Lol.
1588146070386868225 2022-11-03 12:28:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom A few thoughts:  - 100% on the books. I'll never understand reading 52 books per year, when reading one and taking action is much more impactful.  - The black coffee thing is real. My wife finally convinced me about 8 years ago and I've never gone back.  Good stuff!
1588145626746847232 2022-11-03 12:26:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Appreciate you, Cole :)
1588145305538674689 2022-11-03 12:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1588145303437414401 2022-11-03 12:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> And that's it.  TL;DR  1/ Built publishing habit in the AM 2/ Educated my audience each PM 3/ A step-by-step thread once weekly 4/ Engage with 5-8 people in my niche each week 5/ Commented underneath large accounts 6/ Eliminated what wasn't working 7/ Setup inspiration tools
1588145301549891585 2022-11-03 12:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Improved my "inspiration" swipe file:  Writing a lot of Tweets means constantly being inspired.  Here are the tools I use to find that inspiration:  @hypefury (Tweet templates) @TwemexApp (User's best Tweets) @typeshare_co (Thread templates) @TwitterBlue (bookmark fave Tweets)
1588145298374811648 2022-11-03 12:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Eliminated the "touch base" Tweets:  After 90 days, I had a publishing habit.  So I stopped the daily, "Happy Weekday" AM posts.  They weren't adding much value.  I started writing entertaining content or 2x'ing educational Tweets.
1588145295006875650 2022-11-03 12:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Comment underneath large accounts:  One of the best ways to gain visibility here is to participate.  - Find interesting, large accounts - Set up automatic notifications - Read each of their Tweets - Add valuable comments - Engage  It's literally that easy.  https://t.co/9NDh7HHlrN
1588145279798312961 2022-11-03 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Engage with 6-8 interesting people each week:  Make it a habit to build connections.  Here are some smart folks I've chatted with, just to jam out:  @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @TheDanKoe @dickiebush @FitFounder @KateBour @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup  It's "social" media.
1588145277361340418 2022-11-03 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A step-by-step thread once weekly:  Weekly threads powered my growth.  I gained hundreds of thousands of followers by sharing detailed threads.  My goal is to walk someone step-by-step through something critical in solopreneurship.
1588145268972724224 2022-11-03 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> An educational tweet each PM:  Each afternoon, I share a lesson from my solopreneur journey.  Topics include:  - Solopreneurship - Online businesses - Building info products - Using social media effectively  I pretend I'm writing to help ONE person.
1588145264468033537 2022-11-03 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Built my publishing habit each AM:  In October 2021, I committed to publishing daily on Twitter.  I started with a "Happy {Day} to X" Tweet each morning.  I had 2 goals:  1. Build a habit of posting each day. 2. Put my name &amp; face in front of people daily.
1588145262035406851 2022-11-03 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A growing Twitter audience is an asset to any entrepreneur.  I've added 219,487 followers in one year.   Here are the 7 very simple things I did:
1588121510857908224 2022-11-03 10:50:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AskJibran 21k (LinkedIn) and no email list on my first course.
1588121001346404352 2022-11-03 10:48:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mike_Walls_ @jspector Sure. I'm human, so I feel all of the normal emotions that anyone would feel charging $2,000.  To echo Josh's sentiment, I can generally solve the problem in 15 minutes and it's 100% worth the client not screwing around for another 6-12 months. That costs way more than $2,000.
1588120269368999938 2022-11-03 10:45:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RyoGranas That's a great definition, Ryo.
1587980034752528387 2022-11-03 01:28:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ambitiousronen Thanks man!
1587973574278668290 2022-11-03 01:02:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector I am confused, insecure, and worried. Can confirm.
1587924995258601472 2022-11-02 21:49:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonbrosio Underrated Tweet.  Nice work here, Jon.

1587852871260950529 2022-11-02 17:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Execute your promotion plan:  You're ready to execute your presale promotion plan.  Start by including the link to the landing page in your social profiles.   Add it to:  - Your Twitter profile - Your LinkedIn profile - Any Instagram or YouTube accounts you use  And launch!
1587852868693917696 2022-11-02 17:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build a landing page in @Carrd:  Carrd is a simple one-page website builder that costs $19 per year.   You can use Carrd to build out a professional-looking landing page that helps improve conversion.  Here’s what it should include according to @harrydry of MarketingExamples  https://t.co/B4Z7fKFxNg
1587852861492236288 2022-11-02 17:03:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build out your product in @Gumroad:  Once you have the first 3 steps completed, the hardest parts are done.   Now it’s time to build out your product in Gumroad.   I choose Gumroad because it’s fast, cheap, and easy.  Choose your product name, description, &amp; price to get started.
1587852859508408320 2022-11-02 17:03:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> - Announcement - Reminder - Last call  Make sure your promo content answers this question: Why should someone buy this course now, during my presale?  All of your content must highlight the answer to this question.
1587852857444810754 2022-11-02 17:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create a presale promotional plan:  I presold for roughly 30 days because it gave me a little more time to drum up interest.  Next, decide what channels you’ll use to promote it:  - Social media - Your email list - Any community you’re in  Then, sketch out your promo content:
1587852855393878024 2022-11-02 17:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> - What specific problem will you be solving?  - What are the benefits and outcome(s) a student can expect?  - Create an outline for your product that helps solve #1 and delivers #2.  - Keep it short: consider helping them reach their outcome in less than 60 minutes.
1587852853128974336 2022-11-02 17:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create course benefits and outcomes:  Once you choose a topic, so many people start building out the product.   Please don’t do this.  Creating course benefits and outcomes is a step you can’t afford to skip.  Here’s what you want to clearly define:
1587852850851418116 2022-11-02 17:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Choose a topic you can talk about for 30 minutes:  Courses should be about transferring your knowledge to the student.  If you can’t talk about a topic for 30 minutes, unprepared, you probably don’t know enough to sell a course.  This is how you should think about your topic.
1587852847756021760 2022-11-02 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone should own an online course that earns $150+ per day.  The problem?  Most people don't know how to build one.  Here are 6 steps that might help you get started.  ↓
1587812636271710211 2022-11-02 14:23:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Thanks for finally showing me how to use Tweetdeck. Now I have a better experience. Love some of these suggestions as well.

1587784159120039938 2022-11-02 12:30:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Yep. Let the audience guide you.
1587784110059229184 2022-11-02 12:30:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @har8narayan I shut it down.
1587784039674568705 2022-11-02 12:29:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PEfund_guy I'm not sure, to be honest. I'd have to give that some thought.  I'm not super familiar with that world.  Ultimately, who are you looking to attract attention from?
1587783707615707136 2022-11-02 12:28:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @content_remedy I'd say you learn what goes into a digital product by running a service business first.
1587781035466452993 2022-11-02 12:17:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @paulabartabajo_ Thanks!
1587780984677744642 2022-11-02 12:17:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Yep. That's it.
1587780920475525121 2022-11-02 12:17:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Max_Stevens6 I don't agree with that at all.  In fact, in the creator space, I'd say I'm more of an outlier.

1587530591767244800 2022-11-01 19:42:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the_advisor_btc Sweet. See you in the future then.
1587530550071513090 2022-11-01 19:42:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyJimBurgess It's actually Kajabi
1587530478520832001 2022-11-01 19:42:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Thanks, Katelyn!  I never share testimonials, so you've inspired me.

1587490460339245057 2022-11-01 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Too many entrepreneurs are selling products or services for problems they haven't validated as painful.  The more existential the pain, the more people buy.
1587477898897883138 2022-11-01 16:13:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe @itsterryrice Thank you, brother. Hope you're well!
1587431080940171264 2022-11-01 13:07:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 "I can't believe you won't give me 15 minutes of your time!"  - 1 of 5,000 people asking who have never once interacted with me
1587430915306917890 2022-11-01 13:06:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii 100%.  I think at some point, relationships have to become mutual though.
1587430828417712128 2022-11-01 13:06:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Yep.   Everything works that way.  Want a mentor? Make yourself someone worth mentoring.
1587430691742138373 2022-11-01 13:05:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Literally, everything.   "Hi - we don't know each other and have never interacted, but I have a project for you to do, for me, that does not benefit you at all. Down for that?"  Yeah.
1587426944475332609 2022-11-01 12:50:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom That old formula never fails.
1587426892336054274 2022-11-01 12:50:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Love that, Ant.
1587426845141630977 2022-11-01 12:50:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AhmedSaeedBJ Thanks, Ahmed!
1587426686798336001 2022-11-01 12:49:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew This is how my career finally took off.
1587426586491604996 2022-11-01 12:49:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SystemSunday @FitFounder Learning to question everything you believe as fact allows you to reach more truth than you otherwise might. Good stuff, Ben.
1587424687277080578 2022-11-01 12:41:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge @austinbelcak He's the best.  I owe him some time, as I've been moving for the last 5 weeks and haven't been very communicative.  I didn't forget about you, @austinbelcak !
1587424506657837061 2022-11-01 12:41:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshuaKatowitz Smart move, Josh.
1587423316532494338 2022-11-01 12:36:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @francis_oleh Yep. Last time I shared this I had 40k followers. Now 225k. That's 185k new people who have never seen it.
1587423144763072514 2022-11-01 12:35:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets 100%. It's basically the only way.
1587423107593166850 2022-11-01 12:35:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Richard_andey Thanks, Andrew!
1587423086135152640 2022-11-01 12:35:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni Funny how the hack is never really a hack, huh? :)
1587421433319366661 2022-11-01 12:28:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artists_voyage Thank you!
1587421377480589315 2022-11-01 12:28:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Exactly. It's about the other person.  Nearly everyone gets this wrong.
1587420547918561286 2022-11-01 12:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the first Tweet in this thread to share with your audience
1587420545284554756 2022-11-01 12:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It’s been 3 years since our first DM exchange, and we’ve supported each other’s growth since.  This is a really good example of building an organic relationship over time, and how you can work with people to grow together.  And believe it or not, we’ve still never met in person.
1587420542843355137 2022-11-01 12:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2020 to 2022  2020: Austin intros me to a great podcast I become a guest on. 2020: I learn Austin loves beer, I send him some Nashville IPAs. 2021: Austin is a guest in my private community for a presentation. 2022: We’re discussing doing business together.  https://t.co/QUh4apy1HA
1587420535843168257 2022-11-01 12:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2019 to 2020  2019: Austin DMs me &amp; shares a copywriting PDF he enjoys. 2019: I reach out &amp; we book a  Zoom cadence to chat business. 2020: I’m a guest on Austin’s LinkedIn Live event. 2020: We exchange LinkedIn recommendations.  https://t.co/QBW8K3nYum
1587420529321021447 2022-11-01 12:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> An example of this in action:  One of the strongest online relationships I’ve formed over the past 3 years has been with @austinbelcak.   We first exchanged messages in July 2019 as up-and-coming creators.   Here’s how the relationship started and blossomed:
1587420526888337410 2022-11-01 12:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsterryrice Use DMs effectively to build relationships:  I don't need to reinvent the wheel here.   So, if you’re looking for an excellent primer on how to use DMs to build relationships online, read this Tweet thread from @thedankoe
1587420524333916160 2022-11-01 12:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Make a meaningful introduction:  Connecting 2 people who can help one another is powerful.  Solve their problem with a connection &amp; you leapfrog hundreds of other people trying to build that relationship.   @itsterryrice learned I needed help and reached out like this:  https://t.co/REv7agQNGw
1587420518470356993 2022-11-01 12:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Permissionless support:   Support someone w/o asking their permission.  You could share their content in your newsletter or create a visual of their Tweet.  That's exactly what @SachinRamje did with me, creating this beautiful visual that he shared:
1587420515928608768 2022-11-01 12:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Use a relevant, specific compliment:   Tell them something specific they’ve done that you enjoy.   If you liked a specific podcast/article, tell them why, and what impact it had on you.   Use a soft “out”:  i.e. "No need to reply, just wanted to share how it impacted me!"  https://t.co/SKwaruhB2e
1587420509762895873 2022-11-01 12:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create a value-driven relationship approach:  When you reach out to someone, imagine you are one of 1,000 people doing the same thing. Yikes.  How can you differentiate yourself?  Provide value upfront with no expectation of immediate return.  Try 1 of these things weekly ↓
1587420507888140289 2022-11-01 12:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your profile cheat sheet:  - Banner: Show off your brand - Headshot: Clean and polished - Bio: What are you doing &amp; what can people expect? - Pinned Tweet: Provide deeper context on your journey  Answer this: “What am I doing that's interesting enough for someone to follow me?”
1587420505270796290 2022-11-01 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create a clear &amp; compelling profile:  To build strong relationships, you need to give people a reason to be interested in you.  Start with a clear and compelling profile.   This is your "digital first impression", just like a first impression offline.
1587420503165341696 2022-11-01 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Here's what you'll learn in this thread:  1.  Creating a digital "first impression" 2. Using a value-driven approach 3. Combining specificity with support 4. Making relevant intros 5. Using DM's effectively 6. An example of this in action  Let's go ↓
1587420501055528966 2022-11-01 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> To start, trust me when I say this:   Your online network determines your level of success on platforms like Twitter, and largely in your business.  The bigger and stronger your network is, the more likely you are to be successful in whatever endeavor you choose.
1587420498308341761 2022-11-01 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most people suck at building relationships online.  It's always:  - Help me! - Can I pick your brain? - Will you like my Tweet?  A terrible approach.  Here's how the top accounts on Twitter build real relationships:  🧵
1587241475443773440 2022-11-01 00:33:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour @TMitrosilis Thank you :)
1587237043557523456 2022-11-01 00:16:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonbrosio @TMitrosilis Thank you, my man :)
1587236964322971648 2022-11-01 00:15:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexcalish @levelsio I'm literally the least intimidating person on earth.
1587190544811401220 2022-10-31 21:11:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AnonFloridaMan @levelsio Winner of the day.
1587190476234424321 2022-10-31 21:11:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @therobertleonar @levelsio It's super cool. Had a blast with it.
1587190378167504906 2022-10-31 21:10:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkhundmiri @levelsio I wish I had facial muscles like that! I don't, I can promise you that.   Secret: My profile pic is from when I was in exceptionally incredible shape.
1587162277580603398 2022-10-31 19:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theandreboso @levelsio I'll take it :)
1587162208773046278 2022-10-31 19:18:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @light_ope @levelsio I'm the least fierce person ever :)
1587162102401220608 2022-10-31 19:18:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere @levelsio Haha. I love this. A new small revenue stream.
1587160459987353602 2022-10-31 19:11:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Took @levelsio AI Avatar for a spin and now I want to work out more to look like this guy.  A lot of fun for just $30.  https://t.co/ECcrqVz8oc
1587159196860137472 2022-10-31 19:06:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis I like Josh Spector's For The Interested.   He's probably the best curator around.
1587158983248384002 2022-10-31 19:06:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamueleOnelia Hope you enjoy it, Samuele.  Do the 2.0 first, then head to 1.0 to get the templatization instructions.  Cheers!
1587158728230539264 2022-10-31 19:05:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexHustle7 Depends on what you mean by "better".  My favorite part of being a one-person business is total control and very few obligations.
1587144074334715904 2022-10-31 18:06:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcotonycampos Get after it, Marco!
1587144018915467267 2022-10-31 18:06:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Doing is the best way to force learning.
1587143926644985858 2022-10-31 18:06:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HuttonPraesens Yes, but it always creeps back up.
1587143853240467456 2022-10-31 18:05:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thesandeep0303 Thank you, Sandeep!
1587143781975035907 2022-10-31 18:05:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD 100%.
1587143741248339968 2022-10-31 18:05:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jakubzenkai Nobody.
1587143691835265025 2022-10-31 18:05:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writes_eve A great way to test the waters!
1587143654069747712 2022-10-31 18:05:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @torreydawley That's right. You must have that comfort level.
1587143594296614913 2022-10-31 18:04:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew I agree with all of this, Jarek.
1587143493222387715 2022-10-31 18:04:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby I'm not sure it ends, Jack :)
1587128062029725696 2022-10-31 17:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship forces accountability.   You own every single part of your business's successes &amp; failures. There's no team or boss or investors or peers or whatever to blame.   It's just you and your ability to analyze and execute.   Scary but also extremely freeing.
1587071098583146496 2022-10-31 13:16:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Love your "book in bullets" Tweet.  I'm taking this to guide me on my book.
1587071020812337155 2022-10-31 13:16:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Love the idea of repurposing your best stuff in a recap style thread. Great stuff, Dickie.
1587070512974516225 2022-10-31 13:14:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanbaugh27 @Codie_Sanchez @Dmurr68 @ColinandSamir @SahilBloom Thanks, man!
1587070439230259200 2022-10-31 13:14:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Exactly how I feel, Dan.
1587066920641171462 2022-10-31 13:00:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @incomenator Providing mediocre customer service puts you in the "best in class" category at this point.
1587064589879021568 2022-10-31 12:50:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @litwin_sonia True story.  Help others to help yourself.
1587062065692295168 2022-10-31 12:40:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Starting now. Roger that.
1587061996620496896 2022-10-31 12:40:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianSexton13 That's it right there, Brian. Offer a better experience and make people feel like part of something.  Take the business from the corporate behemoth.
1587060477233963010 2022-10-31 12:34:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple Great focus!
1587060366739214336 2022-10-31 12:34:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj There are so many options, sometimes I just don't even know where to start.
1587060070306693122 2022-10-31 12:33:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Looking fwd to it, Katelyn!
1587060028476907520 2022-10-31 12:32:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 If it's good, the folks on this platform will find it.
1587059959229026306 2022-10-31 12:32:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki This was my whole secret as an executive😂
1587059864072863744 2022-10-31 12:32:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Great list here, Kieran.  Always remember emotional outcomes as well:  - This person helped me - This person motivated me - This person challenged me - This person entertained me - This person understands me
1587059605296799745 2022-10-31 12:31:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dellakirkman Also a great option, Della.
1587059555279708160 2022-10-31 12:30:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EcomSpin For sure.
1587059529845456896 2022-10-31 12:30:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona I love my service business :)
1587059496991481856 2022-10-31 12:30:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess And most of it for free, or for an affordable subscription price.
1587059398672785410 2022-10-31 12:30:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour That last sentence captured it, Katelyn.
1587058108681129985 2022-10-31 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You don't need a flashy new idea to build a business.  Go find:  - Antiquated industries - Slow companies - Poor service  Use technology to do a better job &amp; you'll likely start chipping away.  Start small and take a few customers.  A much easier introduction to Solopreneurship.
1587051003521732613 2022-10-31 11:56:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Girirajjhawar07 @rashiaroraoff @alexgarcia_atx Thanks, man!
1586877541083713538 2022-10-31 00:27:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeoffTRoberts Yea sir.
1586826221177954306 2022-10-30 21:03:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Davidco85846237 The floor is dark brown wide plank wood. When our furniture gets in it’ll look great
1586826013727670273 2022-10-30 21:02:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thetomschaeffer Reno!
1586825977501552641 2022-10-30 21:02:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Hell yeah.
1586802579668959236 2022-10-30 19:29:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD @theKevinShen Thanks for this. Need to set up my "perfect office" soon and this will come in handy.  @theKevinShen - you should charge for onsite visit and set up!

1586799060173963266 2022-10-30 19:15:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD No, that will eventually be our master.  My office will have the same flooring (done) and will likely get a dark paint job as well as some built-ins.

1586782974195818496 2022-10-30 18:11:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Start wide, cast a big net.  Let your audience steer you toward who you are and what you are.
1586773849785651202 2022-10-30 17:35:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew @KateBour You’re also always dealing with people on the most important day of their lives.   That can be stressful!

1586707815036588038 2022-10-30 13:13:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @elifozgecanhiz This was my hope.
1586695972012400640 2022-10-30 12:26:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What business would you build if you were guaranteed success, but had to spend the next 25+ years working on it?
1586462476308140032 2022-10-29 20:58:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @levelsio Bought mine today.  This looks like a lot of fun, and a great business. Congrats, @levelsio.

1586340281871368193 2022-10-29 12:52:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThatMarket3r I literally just set a demo with Zirtual and they asked me some questions and sent me a VA. She was great, but she ultimately left.  So I just pinged a bunch of people I knew until I was intro'd to my current VA and we did a trial.

1586338649788104705 2022-10-29 12:46:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1586338647783137281 2022-10-29 12:46:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR:  1. Audit your time 2. Record process videos 3. Store videos in Notion 4. Work together 1:1 for a month 5. Introduce workflow triggers 6. Review weekly
1586338645526593538 2022-10-29 12:46:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Outcome:  Rather than context switching &amp; losing time, I review our worksheet 1x in the AM and in the PM.  This has saved me ~2 hours per day.  That's 40 hours per month.  And with firms like Zirtual charging $750 per month for a VA, it's a great way to get your time back.
1586338643626582016 2022-10-29 12:46:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Review weekly:  Every single week, we catch something that we aren't prepared for.  A new type of inquiry leads to a new video, new instructions, new templates, and new triggers.  So we build them out together.  It's an iterative process that gets better every single week!
1586338640204107779 2022-10-29 12:46:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Move to a trigger-based system:  Once we had worked together for a month, I introduced a trigger system.  1: Grant access to my email 2: She puts each email into a spreadsheet 3: I select the intended action from a drop-down 4: She sees the trigger and takes appropriate action  https://t.co/DKXXDjShQK
1586338631094095880 2022-10-29 12:46:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Spend quality 1:1 time:  Spend your first few weeks or a month, working together 1:1  Meet regularly, give direct feedback, and listen if they have suggestions.  Some VAs are so experienced that they make your processes 10x better.
1586338629034643461 2022-10-29 12:46:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Store the videos in Notion:  Upload videos to a Notion page with additional instructions.  The most common instructions:  - Email templates to respond to prospects and customers - Links to other resources to support their work - Tone and etiquette guides
1586338626878808069 2022-10-29 12:46:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Record Process videos:  Your VA won't always have the background to understand what they’re solving &amp; why.  So, record a video where you walk through every single step.  Share these with a few people who have no context &amp; see if they can complete the tasks you teach on video.
1586338618817368064 2022-10-29 12:46:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Audit what distracts you the most:  I pay close attention to my schedule to understand when I am most distracted, by what, and how often.  I keep a running tally each week to make sure I'm identifying any new distractions that have crept up.  Awareness is your first step.
1586338616288198658 2022-10-29 12:46:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Hiring a virtual assistant is life-changing.  My VA saves me ~40 hours of my time per month.  Here's exactly how we work together in 6 simple steps:
1585978622678106116 2022-10-28 12:55:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ One action away from changing your life.  Good stuff, Matt.
1585975495577174016 2022-10-28 12:43:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjennylane I'm so glad!

1585661627306737671 2022-10-27 15:56:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realstephenlock @paritydeals is what I use.
1585627465250226177 2022-10-27 13:40:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Great thread.   One thing I’d add is to remain humble and always praise others vs. taking credit.   When I was a CRO I tried my hardest to give credit to everyone on my team and in other departments when we successfully hit our targets.
1585618434510946307 2022-10-27 13:04:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bradsbranding My courses are all $150.
1585616508675301376 2022-10-27 12:56:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Psychology has been the most helpful part of learning to write effectively. Writing is less about typing on a keyboard and more about understanding the emotional drivers of your readers.
1585616368304619520 2022-10-27 12:56:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour 1. Understand your happy drivers 2. Build a lifestyle focused on those 3. Build work around that lifestyle 4. Compete to nail #2 and #3
1585616156655755264 2022-10-27 12:55:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Everyone thinks the microscope is on them, but it's reassuring to find out that we're far less important than we think we are.
1585615977932283906 2022-10-27 12:54:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe And you'll also find out that most of your judgement comes without the proper context surrounding the other person or situation.   Learn to observe, but also learn to curious and empathetic.
1585614843075231748 2022-10-27 12:50:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertoblake Yep, or just a small one-person b2c SaaS even.
1585613665042038784 2022-10-27 12:45:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Enjoying the new visuals, Matt 🔥
1585613126183026689 2022-10-27 12:43:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertoblake I just use that term to mean a SaaS that is built as a lifestyle business or to be sold/acquired vs. building some large unicorn company.
1585613003109830657 2022-10-27 12:42:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timgabedesign I am at some point.  I don't have a terrific idea at the moment, but if I can partner with someone who is aiming at my audience, I can handle distribution.
1585612875468529665 2022-10-27 12:42:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitNFortune I was profitable from day 1 because I started building a niche audience about 6 months prior to leaving my job.

1585609694818828289 2022-10-27 12:29:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HaimSchlesinger I don't necessarily think that's true. I focused on 2 right out of the gate and was successful with that.

1585400971877908500 2022-10-26 22:40:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dagorenouf You're blazing your own trail and will be waving back at me in your rearview in no time.  Keep going.
1585380259775807488 2022-10-26 21:18:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen @KateBour @amandanat @ericasmyname @wes_kao @jayclouse @jspector Thank you 🙏
1585317937350471682 2022-10-26 17:10:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Richard_andey That's it right there, Andrew.
1585317869629321216 2022-10-26 17:10:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FreeSites_com Ha. Thanks, Jeff.
1585317823479283713 2022-10-26 17:09:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kulkarniankita9 Because anyone can crack the code on impressions through decent writing and a little support network of other "engagers". Pretty simple.  Making money? Not so much.
1585316140443639808 2022-10-26 17:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's easy to manufacture impressions.  It's hard to manufacture revenue.
1585281646844076033 2022-10-26 14:46:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dagorenouf Sounds huge. You should be super proud of yourself.
1585257944769507328 2022-10-26 13:12:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChristinaAllDay We do 5-6 miles daily.   It's tough not to when this is 5 minutes away:  https://t.co/JsgOXpqfvP
1585253651248869376 2022-10-26 12:54:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina Haha. I'm considering automating it.  https://t.co/whwWMHIoNG
1585251526787809280 2022-10-26 12:46:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RyanHVaughn There is plenty of time in between these things for serendipity.
1585248935631015940 2022-10-26 12:36:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @XyzCammy Yep. Same.
1585248910041182210 2022-10-26 12:36:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @getthinkable I talk with my wife. We generate so many ideas during that time.
1585248412706172929 2022-10-26 12:34:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @XyzCammy My wife :)
1585247869791277057 2022-10-26 12:31:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Yep. It's different for everyone.   The takeaway is just focusing on that which brings you the most joy.
1585247726304112641 2022-10-26 12:31:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SteffenSzameit1 My mission is to help people identify and leverage skills they already have to build a more intentional life through solopreneurship.

1585247275374166016 2022-10-26 12:29:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @francis_oleh @thedankoe Typing.
1585247255392505856 2022-10-26 12:29:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Varun_Bosmia I generally write 4 pieces of content and work on my newsletter. But it varies daily depending on what I'm motivated by.
1585247109904621568 2022-10-26 12:28:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamile Nope. With my wife.  We walk outside.
1585247065931599873 2022-10-26 12:28:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kevinp_tweets Thanks, Kevin!
1585247043345580037 2022-10-26 12:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Yes, here at the end of this newsletter issue:  https://t.co/UExlAc0cqo
1585246218447474695 2022-10-26 12:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are 5 things I love doing each day:  1. Writing for 90+ minutes 2. Walking for 75+ minutes 3. Making lunch with my wife 4. Helping my customers win 5. Having a beautiful glass of wine  I'm determined to eliminate, automate or delegate almost everything else.

1584953742239141902 2022-10-25 17:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're truly entrepreneurial, you don't need to ask internet strangers how to start your business.  Nobody's feedback will be as helpful as the feedback you get when you just start.  Start, then learn.
1584894230601736193 2022-10-25 13:06:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I just had to get new insurance for NY state, and it was a nightmare.  Unclear, tons of brokers and middlemen, and no visibility into what insurance will actually cover.  Plus, at $1,100 a month for 2 people, it's simply a non-starter for many people.
1584890253550067712 2022-10-25 12:50:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reach_growth You said it better than I did, Nate.,
1584890080619294721 2022-10-25 12:50:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Definitely. No path is the path for everyone, but I'd argue that more people than we think could succeed as solopreneurs.  With the definition of success being healthy, happy, and earning enough to invest each month.
1584889767157956610 2022-10-25 12:49:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gethebizz Ain't that the truth.
1584889700862787587 2022-10-25 12:48:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill That's the harsh reality, man.
1584889665617727489 2022-10-25 12:48:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje 100% it is, Sachin.
1584884411115327488 2022-10-25 12:27:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Boyturnman That's it right there.
1584884268232151040 2022-10-25 12:27:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Smart move, Jarek.
1584884200037322758 2022-10-25 12:26:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjennylane It's too bad they can't find jobs they love that also provide flexibility and capital for their side gigs.
1584883442457649152 2022-10-25 12:23:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Never destroy your mental and physical health for a company that would terminate you instantly if it meant a few extra cents on their share price.  Find a good company, use your salary as investment capital, and fund your side project until you have traction.  Then leave.
1584712096033349638 2022-10-25 01:03:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @QuiteBrazen @GuruAnaerobic Claims without data (or proof of another kind) to support them are just that. Claims.  We can all make claims and suggest a data integrity challenge about nearly anything to make up for not having data.  It just takes a convincing argument and an audience willing to hear it.
1584709627052457984 2022-10-25 00:53:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @QuiteBrazen @GuruAnaerobic @dvassallo "There were no positive effects from taking the vaxx. The biggest fraud in my lifetime.?  "The sars-cov2 virus was bio-engineered and escaped from a lab. Possibly the biggest crime in my lifetime."  But I just didn't see any evidence attached, so I was simply looking for it.
1584709328665464832 2022-10-25 00:52:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @QuiteBrazen @GuruAnaerobic @dvassallo Yeah, maybe I tied the two together without realizing they weren't directly related. That's fair.  In the end, I was just looking for more clarity on the original statements.  He made 2 bold claims:
1584706815849156608 2022-10-25 00:42:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @QuiteBrazen @GuruAnaerobic @dvassallo No actually it wasn’t on purpose. It was a miss on my part. You’re mistaking my question for an argument when I’m actually genuinely curious.
1584704513088565249 2022-10-25 00:32:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GuruAnaerobic @dvassallo Genuinely curious: how did you go from "biggest fraud in my lifetime" to "I'm no expert on this"?
1584652731125358592 2022-10-24 21:07:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tgs0376 Yes sir
1584652686884233217 2022-10-24 21:06:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CallMeElleTwo Moved!
1584652611424505856 2022-10-24 21:06:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjankoch Yep, but I didn't always.
1584593625245417473 2022-10-24 17:12:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Richard_andey Amazing. Great comment, Andrew. Love it.
1584593401668046849 2022-10-24 17:11:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith 100%.   Prove you know what you're doing. Figure out where you are right and wrong.   Then package up the right.
1584592768244252672 2022-10-24 17:08:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiswenzel Real friends pay.
1584592734215892992 2022-10-24 17:08:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @francis_oleh LOL.
1584592711113641984 2022-10-24 17:08:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Agreed. A lot of cliche statements aren't true.
1584592656004366336 2022-10-24 17:08:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Exactly. That's the ticket right there, Mike.
1584591360417562626 2022-10-24 17:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don't sell without credibility.  Here's how to build some:  - Figure out who you enjoy spending time with - Talk to them about their challenges - Learn how to solve them - Share what you learn - Repeat  Do this for a year, and you'll build a wonderful reputation.  Then sell.
1584553650172874752 2022-10-24 14:33:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Emilio_emb This business will always just be me.   I may build a company some day but only if I'm inspired to.

1584531162394816512 2022-10-24 13:04:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Thanks for the shout, my man.  Very much appreciated, Charles.
1584525906735165441 2022-10-24 12:43:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni Right, Kurtis?
1584525865462812672 2022-10-24 12:43:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @karlsutt Thanks, Karl!
1584525839378845696 2022-10-24 12:42:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Me too, Ali.
1584525805832785920 2022-10-24 12:42:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dellakirkman 1. Start. 2. Analyze. 3. Keep going.
1584523897302847488 2022-10-24 12:35:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman Perfect GIF choice.
1584523853006393345 2022-10-24 12:35:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heykahn Haha. I'm not even hating. I love VC-backed businesses, but man oh man...generating organic attention online is tough to beat.
1584523733653671937 2022-10-24 12:34:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew It's wild times we're living in, Kieran. Might as well take advantage of them.
1584522736663085056 2022-10-24 12:30:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maxi_page And you're only competition is really yourself.
1584522640362213383 2022-10-24 12:30:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @torreydawley Thank you, Torrey!
1584522603976593410 2022-10-24 12:30:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @har8narayan Literally, anyone.
1584522541669830656 2022-10-24 12:29:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jennylane_fes It's possible. Just takes some time.
1584522499479699456 2022-10-24 12:29:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JG__II I just moved here. See ya there!
1584522469313896448 2022-10-24 12:29:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wellymulia Some.
1584522445977194496 2022-10-24 12:29:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timjcarden It just takes a first step.
1584522409423835137 2022-10-24 12:29:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TimelessTools I love it, Pedro. The Solopreneur mantra.
1584522361662906368 2022-10-24 12:29:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Amazing huh?
1584521383580958721 2022-10-24 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My little one-person digital product business in The Catskill Mountains in NY generates more impressions, and more revenue, at higher margins than the average early-stage, VC-backed, B2B startup marketing teams using $50k+ marketing software.  Internet leverage is incredible.
1584361438147055617 2022-10-24 01:49:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @mihapuc @arvidkahl It's been the price that has converted highest at the best average revenue per unit for my business.
1584331437565939712 2022-10-23 23:50:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl $150
1584305060564959233 2022-10-23 22:05:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao @HansRosling It's one of (if not) my favorite books.  I read it and then listened to it the second time around.  So necessary in today's world.
1584233422297653249 2022-10-23 17:20:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mopsywer @matt_gray_ Heck yeah. I love Mexico City.  Next trip there will be my 10th. Thanks!
1584192434203828226 2022-10-23 14:38:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thatroblennon Thanks for the feature, Rob!
1584174753446645760 2022-10-23 13:27:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ CDMX is my favorite.  Best lunch spot for people watching? Contramar.  Get the tuna tostadas and then green and red fish. Lovely.
1584168880737771522 2022-10-23 13:04:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew I was a field sales rep for 8 years. 100% agree.
1584165391865372679 2022-10-23 12:50:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshuaKatowitz Sometimes you can guide the prospect right into selling themselves if you deeply understand their problem and can articulate the solution.
1584162907130327041 2022-10-23 12:40:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf My father started in sales in 1970 and retired in 2020.   50 years, one company, first-ballot hall of famer.
1584160617078091776 2022-10-23 12:31:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDividendGoat Placement is great. Learning how to articulate value and sell will accelerate that.
1584160521867395072 2022-10-23 12:31:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple I love that.
1584160467341447169 2022-10-23 12:31:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SirajoMusa_ It's a skill just like shooting a basketball or hitting a baseball.
1584160365398876162 2022-10-23 12:30:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill Absolutely, Barrett. The most critical skill to learn, IMO.
1584159749935083520 2022-10-23 12:28:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona The best skill to have, IMO.
1584159250346962944 2022-10-23 12:26:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Want to build a powerful one-person business?  Learn how to sell.  Every single day you're selling something:  - Idea - Vision - Product - Solution - Customers  Learn to sell and you're a one-person distribution machine.
1583795962912251904 2022-10-22 12:22:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Today is a fantastic day to log off of the internet.  Because creativity comes during your brain's resting state.   That state when you're not paying attention to anything in particular, but incubating ideas without even realizing it.  See you all tomorrow.
1583562066488856576 2022-10-21 20:53:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Fame seems awful.  I get enough social media anger as a little niche account here on Twitter. I can't imagine what famous stars deal with.
1583475770693156864 2022-10-21 15:10:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dr I used to love threads.  But there are only so many websites and Chrome extensions that are "so good (they should be illegal!)" threads that I can stand.  But, the market seems to respond, so I guess that makes me wrong? Oh well.
1583475351610499073 2022-10-21 15:08:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thelifeofrishi Appreciate this. Will get signed up later today and check it out. Thanks, Rishi!
1583462717121495046 2022-10-21 14:18:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao Thank you, Wes!
1583454012317532160 2022-10-21 13:43:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Appreciate you including The Saturday Solopreneur, Alex. Much love, man.
1583447837882208256 2022-10-21 13:19:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @todd_herman @upcoachapp @Gladwell I could do something that I've done before, potentially (that they haven't seen). Shoot me a DM and I'll give you my email.
1583447632596602883 2022-10-21 13:18:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MohamedWalidDev Upstate NY.
1583445588225380352 2022-10-21 13:10:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @todd_herman @upcoachapp I'm not doing much until I finish a massive book project on my plate :)
1583445511587368960 2022-10-21 13:10:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruno_nwogu Mostly just tiring.
1583445453181374466 2022-10-21 13:09:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Thank you, Alex!
1583445420566454273 2022-10-21 13:09:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @prvsomani Focus on one until you deeply understand it. Then diversify.
1583444963026534401 2022-10-21 13:07:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 And your unique viewpoint on a subject makes it original. Isn't that wonderful?
1583444631110397952 2022-10-21 13:06:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Bookmarked. This is wildly helpful as someone who writes daily.
1583444517159854081 2022-10-21 13:06:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Wow. That is really, really interesting. Don't drink a coffee and walk into a luxury store.
1583444384581709824 2022-10-21 13:05:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Damn. 5am and out the door? That's commitment, Dickie.
1583443952828416000 2022-10-21 13:03:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe With each piece of content you ship, you chip away at the bad habit of continued inaction.
1583442501830348808 2022-10-21 12:58:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heykahn You're the model, Zain. You kill it everywhere. Gold touch.
1583442443701145604 2022-10-21 12:57:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Yeah, I feel that.  I'm just getting bored seeing all of the top 10 tools, top 10 websites, top 10 chrome plugins, etc.  People love them, so doesn't matter what I think, but I'm gonna step back and wait until that all blows over.
1583441706435112961 2022-10-21 12:54:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Thank you, brother!
1583440914126544897 2022-10-21 12:51:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theBMcopywriter It sure does, Zohaib. I've tested the same things.
1583440366409519104 2022-10-21 12:49:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TimeToLevelUp_ Thank you so much!
1583440284670889984 2022-10-21 12:49:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JosephSeifert22 Amazing, Joseph. Congrats, man.

1583437981431406592 2022-10-21 12:40:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Dude. Epic.  Congrats on the weight loss. I need to join this plan!
1583437558981136384 2022-10-21 12:38:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Same, man.  It's been a blast connecting with you all.

1583436890794954752 2022-10-21 12:35:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jyriand Most of them nowadays are just tools, websites, etc.
1583436759903326208 2022-10-21 12:35:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel @pyquantnews That's so amazing man. Congrats!
1583436677552345088 2022-10-21 12:34:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThomasKStrider Nah.  Just a little traction this AM.
1583436540424130560 2022-10-21 12:34:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Alek_Octopus Great takeaways.
1583436412606500864 2022-10-21 12:33:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjeremyenns @SahilBloom I'll take it!
1583436341039493121 2022-10-21 12:33:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshuaKatowitz Hell yeah. Thank you so much, Josh. What a great compliment to receive.
1583436187708313600 2022-10-21 12:33:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thank you, my man. Just trying to catch you.
1583436087128563712 2022-10-21 12:32:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YourFriendAbdul Congrats, Abdulmalik!
1583436054123933696 2022-10-21 12:32:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @torreydawley I love that comment, Torrey.
1583435761386344448 2022-10-21 12:31:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjeremyenns Thanks, Jeremy!
1583435736237608961 2022-10-21 12:31:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MyLearningNotes For sure, Justin.
1583435113798725632 2022-10-21 12:28:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KetanNashit Thank you so much, Ketan. Much appreciated man.
1583435075105935360 2022-10-21 12:28:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ethan_Mick Thanks, Ethan. Much appreciated.

1583434238627434497 2022-10-21 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tomorrow, I'm going to break down 3 more keys to my success over the last year in my weekly newsletter.  If you're trying to grow a Twitter audience, it's a must-read.  Come join 55,478 subscribers to The Saturday Solopreneur here:   https://t.co/X3l2wfO686
1583434236195110912 2022-10-21 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Karma is Real:  The more I've gone out of my way to help people here, the more people have come back to help me.  If you're not sure how to start leveraging this platform, start by helping.  Offer guidance, assistance, connections, etc.  That's a way to get quick wins.
1583434234001137665 2022-10-21 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your Network is Your Twitter-Worth:  I've been fortunate to connect with some really high-impact creators this year.  By building relationships online and offline, my. content has been amplified by their engagement.  I wish I would have started networking sooner.
1583434231685861378 2022-10-21 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Education is Key:  If I look at the Tweets that ended up driving views on my profile, they are mostly when I teach something.  Platitudes have their place, but if you can't teach or educate, it's tough to show off your expertise.  Try your best to teach in 280 characters.
1583434229408751616 2022-10-21 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Threads Matter:  Of my top 10 performing posts, 9 of them are threads.  But, I see so many listicle threads nowadays that I've drastically reduced threading.  Outside of this small thread, I want to wait until sharing really valuable information comes back in style.
1583434220793655299 2022-10-21 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Last week I Tweeted for the 365th day in a row.  This is what happened:  - 134.59M impressions - 208,656 new followers - 13.957M visits to my profile  These are the 4 key lessons I learned:

1583160271501426688 2022-10-20 18:16:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jhreha No. It's Lake Minnewaska in NY.
1583160102676094978 2022-10-20 18:15:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Nah. Too cold :)

1583146358734983169 2022-10-20 17:21:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_brantley Hell yeah. Congrats!
1583145178470445064 2022-10-20 17:16:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChristineCarril Lake Minnewaska right near my house.
1583145110984101888 2022-10-20 17:16:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Lake Minnewaska!
1583141827988766720 2022-10-20 17:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm a solopreneur so I can go on mid-day hikes without asking permission.  https://t.co/ThV6HPJVDu
1583111948560130048 2022-10-20 15:04:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Super bummed I miss this. Next one Upstate?
1583082129998901250 2022-10-20 13:06:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BlackLabelAdvsr Thank you, Jon :)
1583082090538885120 2022-10-20 13:05:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ranbirsinghlive Sure. Just start Tweeting.
1583076675411402753 2022-10-20 12:44:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRedScarf7 That's part of the learning process.
1583076626786439168 2022-10-20 12:44:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @creation247 That's how you get started.  Everything goes from there...
1583073914841747457 2022-10-20 12:33:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @priyankaiitk Nailing it here, Priyanka. Congrats on your business!
1583073079680303104 2022-10-20 12:30:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Yep.  You don't need to read 50 blog posts or articles.  Starting gives you the information you need to get better.
1583072965180424192 2022-10-20 12:29:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GlennPoulos All free.
1583072902118662145 2022-10-20 12:29:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Isn't that the best, man? I remember my first payment like it was yesterday.
1583072820057161729 2022-10-20 12:29:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheTechOasis1 Nope. I don't know much about SEO.
1583072730148061184 2022-10-20 12:28:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheNickKorwin Teach people something specific every day.  Skip platitudes and observations.
1583072651299651587 2022-10-20 12:28:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Student4everOne I love it, Jagadeesh.
1583072611424051201 2022-10-20 12:28:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @philipjabenton Congrats!
1583072582622146561 2022-10-20 12:28:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Downhill in a good way :)
1583072549520359424 2022-10-20 12:28:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gideon_shawana I'm trying.
1583072532206264320 2022-10-20 12:27:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bhardwaj_srijan Exactly, Srijan.
1583072488249958400 2022-10-20 12:27:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Just put one foot in front of the other.
1583071831564877824 2022-10-20 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Imagine that tomorrow, you finally decide to build a simple landing page, start talking about the problem you solve daily on Twitter, and nervously ask people to visit that page where they can buy a product or service you offer.   Congrats. You're on your way to Solopreneurship.
1582905515382050817 2022-10-20 01:24:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere This is awesome, Pranshu. I love seeing your creativity applied to my Tweet.  Thanks for sharing this!
1582779415531905027 2022-10-19 17:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What's a challenge you have as a creator that nobody has been able to solve?
1582762642363805696 2022-10-19 15:56:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmandaMGoetz She really is ❤️
1582762206382690306 2022-10-19 15:54:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hurtandgay @alananybusiness Oh, I know.  I just don't need that much.
1582721691712512000 2022-10-19 13:13:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Love that reframe, Dan.
1582714994298232832 2022-10-19 12:47:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple Same here!
1582714888392056832 2022-10-19 12:46:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JakeMRichards Thanks, Jake!
1582714838349795328 2022-10-19 12:46:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TymHartwich Help others to help ourselves.
1582714783392202757 2022-10-19 12:46:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @har8narayan Exactly, har.
1582714747187007488 2022-10-19 12:46:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshuaKatowitz Thanks, Josh.  It feels good when it comes back full circle.
1582712469314600961 2022-10-19 12:37:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryandeniswalker Thanks, Ryan!
1582711181210681347 2022-10-19 12:32:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Funny huh? :)
1582710787709497344 2022-10-19 12:30:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PatThePM Wild huh? It's why attention is shifting, IMO, Pat.
1582710664355016706 2022-10-19 12:30:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere Appreciate it, man!
1582710599657476096 2022-10-19 12:29:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom The whole damn thing.  Help others to help yourself.
1582710448285454337 2022-10-19 12:29:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @toluwaniadewole Yes. Look at politicians.
1582710237379055616 2022-10-19 12:28:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere I love that way of thinking about it, Pranshu.
1582710049461280769 2022-10-19 12:27:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timgabedesign Win Win for sure, Tim.
1582709524573523969 2022-10-19 12:25:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is a Karma game.  I'm convinced that helping others over the course of your career is the single greatest investment you can make.  People who succeed without this are the exception, not the rule.
1582706584823926785 2022-10-19 12:13:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge This is being added to my Content System.  Absolutely love this, man.
1582432808076599298 2022-10-18 18:05:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikefutia Amazing! Great work, Mike.
1582417023799201802 2022-10-18 17:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is about leadership.  You're not leading a team, but you're expected to lead your customers to the goals &amp; outcomes they desire.  So, check your messaging everywhere:  - Content - Website - Newsletter - Product pages  Is it customer outcome-focused or you-focused?
1582394663050219520 2022-10-18 15:34:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I've personally found that AI writing tools make my job harder, not easier.  I'd rather stare at a blank screen than at a pile of random words.  But, I also think we're just at the beginning and the future is bright.
1582392979595350017 2022-10-18 15:27:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf I just came back from one of these with the intention of sharing it. Now, I'm just a copycat!
1582348507381641217 2022-10-18 12:30:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThomasKStrider @CSMikeCardona Smart. Shoulda led with that!
1582347358549204993 2022-10-18 12:26:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Haha. Terrible advice 😆
1582347059075907585 2022-10-18 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Next time you have a tough choice to make in your business, ask yourself this simple question:  "What choice would I make if I wasn't afraid?"  Whatever it is, there's your answer.
1582331881059921920 2022-10-18 11:24:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Nice thread here, Dan.  I think a lot of people in the one-person business space want to explore all of their interests at once.  What's better is to become an authority in a niche space and then expand outward, slowly over time.
1582076791367565313 2022-10-17 18:31:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LeeMcLaren11 @MrJacobEspi @thedankoe Thanks, Lee. Much appreciated.
1582076370712084480 2022-10-17 18:29:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Ooh. I love that, man!
1582055009394782208 2022-10-17 17:04:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @onepersonbizguy Certainly does.
1582054628954234880 2022-10-17 17:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What you work on is more important than how hard you work on it.
1581991940593135618 2022-10-17 12:54:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill You know SEO is a key focus of mine in 2023. Love this thread, Barrett.
1581986934464794626 2022-10-17 12:34:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TimelessTools Sounds like lucky more than unlucky.
1581986862788653056 2022-10-17 12:33:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lawsy122 I think the answer is so different for everyone.  Maybe a good rule of thumb could be 60% or 70%?   But, again, financial circumstances are so wildly different for every person.
1581986285602091009 2022-10-17 12:31:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sean_deloughery Bias toward action is a key theme in my life.
1581986115971862529 2022-10-17 12:30:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thecolbykultgen It always kept me balanced too, Colby. Exactly!
1581986006059737088 2022-10-17 12:30:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dgledesma Just keep going, Diego.
1581985963819270144 2022-10-17 12:30:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @torreydawley I thought of my 9 to 5 as investment capital. Love this approach, Torrey.
1581985885704269826 2022-10-17 12:30:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere Love it, Pranshu.
1581985811314024448 2022-10-17 12:29:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom A few thoughts:  What is something my family and friends ask me for help with often?  What is something my colleagues come to me for, or projects at work that my boss often puts on my plate?  Answer those questions and try and intersect them with things you enjoy doing.
1581985090015350784 2022-10-17 12:26:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Keep working. It's a marathon.
1581984695708897280 2022-10-17 12:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build a one-person side project.  If you're lucky, it grows bigger &amp; maybe you make enough money to quit your 9 to 5.  And if you're even luckier, you build something so meaningful that you exit, retire, &amp; work on passion projects.  But it's all a dream without a bet on yourself.
1581812243670663170 2022-10-17 01:00:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jesseogtm Thanks, my man. ❤️  I’ve got 5 impostors at all times. Finally had to stop trying to eliminate them. Twitter doesn’t care unfortunately.
1581762792603860992 2022-10-16 21:43:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottsanchez Lol. "Prime Quitting", "Pinnacle Quitting", "Quitting for 2nd", "Meaningful Quitting", the list goes on...
1581655816486076418 2022-10-16 14:38:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_nathanrene I love this.
1581653991649292289 2022-10-16 14:31:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_nathanrene I'm only good at things for about 4.5 years.   So, expect a nano-brewery or pizza restaurant in a few years 😂
1581650893795049472 2022-10-16 14:18:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @willstew I am.
1581637826177032192 2022-10-16 13:26:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ndwignall Really good reframe. I like that.
1581637250689150979 2022-10-16 13:24:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyimSalB I did 3 months. But it's different for everyone. Some should have 12.
1581624839630385152 2022-10-16 12:35:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maikroservice Love that, Maik.
1581624805660405760 2022-10-16 12:35:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GrammarHippy That's how you stay in the game long term.
1581624739898208257 2022-10-16 12:34:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Win-Win-Win.
1581624218542039040 2022-10-16 12:32:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KusshalPatel Thank you!
1581624076971692038 2022-10-16 12:32:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Inspired by our conversation :)
1581622447903690752 2022-10-16 12:25:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KusshalPatel Is this part of a larger tweet from him? Would love to read it if you have the link handy.
1581622116872396800 2022-10-16 12:24:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @francis_oleh I hope you read it! 😂
1581621996592324609 2022-10-16 12:24:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_rois All critically important things to understand, Matan.
1581621419112529921 2022-10-16 12:21:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> High-performers are quitting in their prime.  I know 10+ people who reached the pinnacle of their space, looked around &amp; realized everyone around them was unhappy.  So they quit &amp; pursued something vastly different, armed with their knowledge &amp; a Twitter account.  How freeing.
1581620177334329344 2022-10-16 12:16:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DaniQuelchy @Nicolascole77 I struggled between this line and that one. Two of my faves.
1581448232634195968 2022-10-16 00:53:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @okcmayor Nice work, man! Thanks for putting it together 🙌🏻
1581314965088374784 2022-10-15 16:04:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SteveOnSpeed Thank you, my man!
1581307049832435712 2022-10-15 15:32:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Great framework, Dickie.  Part of learning is also gravitating toward the things that you're truly and naturally curious about.  Learning becomes so much easier when it's a curiosity rather than force that's driving it.
1581259413653856258 2022-10-15 12:23:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Making $200k/yr selling info products broken down:  - $16.7k per month - Which is $540/day - Which is 4 customers @ $135 - Which is 285 daily web visits at 1.4% conversion  Mind you, none of this is easy.  But it's certainly easier than staring $200k in the face without a plan.

1580935400540905472 2022-10-14 14:55:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ethan_Mick Great addition here, Ethan.
1580934682559946753 2022-10-14 14:52:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jjtalentcoach People think you build a product, then look for distribution.  I think that's a recipe for failure. Build your distribution channel first. You'll learn more about prospective customers, what they want, and what not to build.  When you finally ship, you'll have customers waiting.
1580933235584143360 2022-10-14 14:47:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship simplified:   Step 1: Build competency  Step 2: Build distribution  Step 3: Build product  Step 4: Build systems  Start niche, move slowly outward over time.
1580908624578166784 2022-10-14 13:09:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mpickle @thedankoe I can certainly appreciate that side too.
1580904453820981249 2022-10-14 12:52:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It's why I can't understand choosing to either work for a business or start a business you aren't in love with.  Work literally becomes life. Make sure you enjoy it.
1580904292135079938 2022-10-14 12:52:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Everyone sharing revenue. Few sharing income.
1580904105866059777 2022-10-14 12:51:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Everyone, not just founders, should have their origin story. It gives such context to nearly everything you do in life.
1580903941076037634 2022-10-14 12:50:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Goodnight Moon.
1580903849966985216 2022-10-14 12:50:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour People always ask me, "Should I write, share images, record videos, or do a podcast?"  Do what you enjoy. That's where consistency comes into play.
1580902410939117569 2022-10-14 12:44:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman Appreciate you, Tom. Hope you're well brother.

1580712319482417153 2022-10-14 00:09:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mmuxdesign I know right? How embarrassing 😂
1580712249421099009 2022-10-14 00:09:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis So nice...
1580673663921115136 2022-10-13 21:35:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RileyVasquez I just left TN :)
1580673374375665664 2022-10-13 21:34:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WatkinsTBen @writingtoriches I didn't enjoy TN, but that's just me. I prefer NY or CA, and so we moved to NY but 2 hours north of the city.  Not humid as of yet.
1580672252240355328 2022-10-13 21:30:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SDeggans It's in Upstate, NY (Accord, NY)
1580672191883923457 2022-10-13 21:29:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tamintegration I do.
1580672134988242944 2022-10-13 21:29:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches It's upstate NY. Moved!

1580642784720998400 2022-10-13 19:33:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeoffTRoberts Accord, NY.   Specifically Inness Hotel &amp; Club right now.
1580641495396552709 2022-10-13 19:27:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeoffTRoberts Just moved up here. 🏔
1580641237685932032 2022-10-13 19:26:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina  https://t.co/B4cDzJmDpF
1580639438019100674 2022-10-13 19:19:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina Cool. I think you'll likely continue to add? If so, we're speaking the same language. I don't mean begin with 4-5. I just mean you're more likely to hit your income goals, in the long run, with multiple. That's all.
1580638603507818496 2022-10-13 19:16:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina Do you have 4-5 income streams now?
1580636904931831808 2022-10-13 19:09:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm a solopreneur so I can have the occasional mid-day autumn beer with my wife.  https://t.co/HZV14YCbui
1580636537745985537 2022-10-13 19:08:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I love non-technical solopreneurs building their own one-person businesses.  I'd love to see more of them in my feed.  Who should I be following?
1580609706187403265 2022-10-13 17:21:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dr_ulum_s Agreed. All good things are, though!
1580606613974843393 2022-10-13 17:09:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mihapuc Lots of people put all of their focus into one thing and fail.  Why not try many things and focus on what you get traction with?
1580606471464976384 2022-10-13 17:08:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jjtalentcoach You start with diversity and allow traction to pull you into focus.
1580606359900663808 2022-10-13 17:08:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidfuesser I do it underneath one umbrella.
1580605884773720070 2022-10-13 17:06:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MrShaneBreslin @dvassallo You should join! I'm part of it, and it's wonderful.
1580605085054165007 2022-10-13 17:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your self-employed income goals are more likely to be achieved with a portfolio strategy.  Think 4-5 smaller income streams.  Provides much greater flexibility and reduced risk when compared to one big bet.
1580562510771458048 2022-10-13 14:14:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gmitslouie Thanks for including me with these folks, Louie. Much appreciated.
1580539834308775941 2022-10-13 12:43:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coachmillyj You're welcome!
1580539668806127618 2022-10-13 12:43:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Except move the 7 to the front :)  You've got a lot of influence and I always appreciate that you use it positively.
1580537303982014469 2022-10-13 12:33:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyAmna1 If you have this mindset, you won't have 1 follower for long, Amna :)

1580536469164544003 2022-10-13 12:30:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TYonClubhouse Nope. Just a simple observation.
1580536434812854273 2022-10-13 12:30:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach True story, Ashley.

1580536049943519232 2022-10-13 12:28:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @priyankaiitk Just one small share each morning and you're exponentially improving how lucky you can be in the future.
1580535941353340928 2022-10-13 12:28:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @albadawee Love that, Sohaib.
1580535114143920128 2022-10-13 12:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every morning, I wake up with the realization that I can create my own luck, at scale, by helping 217k+ people who have decided to give me a small sliver of their attention.  There is infinite upside and very limited downside to sharing what you learn each day.

1580194185067782145 2022-10-12 13:50:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Today is my 365th day in a row Tweeting.  And I've added 208k+ followers.  Here are 5 lessons learned:  1. Become known for one specific thing 2. Comment under large accounts 3. Share a useful tip each day 4. Engage w/ 5+ people daily 5. Drop 1 thread a week  Hope that's helpful.

1580171018391257088 2022-10-12 12:18:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Yep. Go look for gold or sell pick axes.
1580170942344441856 2022-10-12 12:18:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Ha. Perfectly stated, Charles.

1580169751921274880 2022-10-12 12:13:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caitmackcs Agreed. It's a pretty wild time to skip.
1580169708224987137 2022-10-12 12:13:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bikenn_njukang Many, many people.
1580169664692637697 2022-10-12 12:13:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hi_harshi Perfectly stated.
1580169639169925120 2022-10-12 12:12:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alananybusiness I woulda sold and disappeared forever 😂
1580168570461306880 2022-10-12 12:08:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Imagine that by spending 45 minutes per day on the internet sharing knowledge and interacting with other smart people, you can build a network that will provide you leverage for the next 30+ years of your life.

1580016250935476225 2022-10-12 02:03:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg A rollercoaster of a Tweet, Greg. You'll be excellent at this. Looking fwd to it.
1579881995441967105 2022-10-11 17:09:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Love this man! Thank you.
1579880301458644999 2022-10-11 17:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You can't control a recession.  But you can control building deep expertise in something people desperately need during one.
1579848707759276032 2022-10-11 14:57:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulMCaffrey I had a panic attack in late 2018 and knew something had to change in my life.
1579827059035373568 2022-10-11 13:31:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Austen Button A for me is a no-brainer.  I'd love $10M, but I'm pretty sure if you gave me $1M, I'd have more than a 15% chance of turning it into $10M.
1579816084957691904 2022-10-11 12:48:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pbasilstrength Same. There is no better teacher than a bit of failure.
1579815066618105856 2022-10-11 12:43:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Shipping and getting feedback is the fastest way to get things right.
1579814077303779329 2022-10-11 12:40:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomEddie For sure. To be clear, they are super valuable.  But it doesn't matter much if you never really get started and learn on your own.
1579813902690684930 2022-10-11 12:39:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jjtalentcoach Nearly everything has been independent learning. I've taken 2 online courses in 4 years, and probably read a handful of books, but the time spent pales in comparison to just doing things.
1579812670546784256 2022-10-11 12:34:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisTaudien There is no recipe or shortcut. Everyone's journey is very different.
1579812570906910721 2022-10-11 12:34:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @har8narayan Teach yourself what you can, and then apprentice once you've reached a ceiling.
1579812473817174016 2022-10-11 12:33:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Thanks, Sohaib!
1579812045943640064 2022-10-11 12:31:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It truly does. Taking action is basically business medicine.
1579811810701881344 2022-10-11 12:31:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @torreydawley Not even close, Torrey.
1579811758856097792 2022-10-11 12:30:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @philiponfood True story.
1579811730569691136 2022-10-11 12:30:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coldwrites There is a ton of value in mentors, peers, articles, etc.   But, in the end you have to start.
1579811615092137989 2022-10-11 12:30:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JosephSeifert22 It absolutely is, Joseph.
1579811585325174784 2022-10-11 12:30:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza Take action, learn, and improve.
1579810197836480513 2022-10-11 12:24:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My business started growing when I realized that nobody was going to come teach me how to do everything to be successful.  Threads, articles, peers, mentors, colleagues, friends, &amp; family are all great, but in the end, solopreneurs thrive when they start and learn.
1579517915329859584 2022-10-10 17:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship isn't about time, it's about discipline.  - Big goals - Check-in points - Daily action steps  My calendar is 30% regimented and 70% flexible.  Regimented for consistent achievement. Flexible for new opportunities.
1579458765090607104 2022-10-10 13:08:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @therossmcdaniel Me neither. But there might not be one and that allows us to live our lives more randomly, therefore experiencing more things. Win/Win!
1579458271844659200 2022-10-10 13:06:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder The body and mind both need down time. It's when muscles heal and when the brain incubates interesting ideas.
1579457554727731200 2022-10-10 13:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @therossmcdaniel Definitely. This isn't meant to be binary as though it's either routine or no routine.   It's just about structuring our days to be productive, but remembering that productivity often comes from downtime, incubation of ideas, a change of scenery, etc.
1579449525844201472 2022-10-10 12:31:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Char1ieBennett Great comment here, Charlie. Love that.
1579449480625393664 2022-10-10 12:31:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg They've worked well for me. IPAs get my creative juices flowing (or maybe they are just 7%)
1579449246490972160 2022-10-10 12:30:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alananybusiness Sometimes you can't fight an uncreative block.
1579449168153939974 2022-10-10 12:30:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyJimBurgess It's where my best ideas come from, Jim.
1579449095114326016 2022-10-10 12:29:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdsFunnelSales Smart hack.
1579449074650329092 2022-10-10 12:29:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ale_bizpln Agreed 100%, Alejandro.
1579449035022569474 2022-10-10 12:29:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple Taking time off is when our brain is incubating new ideas as well.
1579448960422653952 2022-10-10 12:29:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza It certainly can be, Antonio.
1579447961066434561 2022-10-10 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My favorite productivity hack is to stop trying to be productive all of the time.  Humans aren't designed to be productivity machines.  - Vary your routine. - Enjoy a new setting. - Embrace randomness.  You might become more productive anyways.
1579093479946260480 2022-10-09 12:56:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 It's amazing how a dumb thought can become a great article.
1579093384257757184 2022-10-09 12:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It's also worth pointing out that humans aren't really designed to be productivity machines.  One of my favorite "productivity hacks" is to stop trying to be productive all of time.
1579092965804212225 2022-10-09 12:54:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki 2023 Goals.
1579092893456773121 2022-10-09 12:54:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Congratulations, Katelyn!
1579089805907894272 2022-10-09 12:42:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryan_c_walsh I agree 100% with that. Just plain truth, Ryan.
1579089131971698688 2022-10-09 12:39:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhimanyu_b06 Definitely. I've learned much more working for myself. That's the Tweet.
1579089037503385601 2022-10-09 12:38:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple That's how I was. It's a great way to start.
1579088434744160256 2022-10-09 12:36:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue Likely never.
1579088390594908166 2022-10-09 12:36:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Chief Everything Officer.
1579087142172917760 2022-10-09 12:31:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Damn, ain't this the truth.
1579086748248072192 2022-10-09 12:29:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewmcbarnett Definitely. People don't realize how hard something is when we move from theorizing it to actually doing it.
1579086657575587840 2022-10-09 12:29:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BlackEmpressoff Always.
1579086640739659777 2022-10-09 12:29:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThomasKStrider Seems to work that way for everyone.
1579086582644342784 2022-10-09 12:29:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Always the best route.
1579085253758816257 2022-10-09 12:23:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I spent 10 years working for entrepreneurs and 3 years being one.   The latter taught me 100x more.

1578873358011072512 2022-10-08 22:21:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg @sweatystartup @schlaf Let's do it. Gotta come East at some point too.
1578868895209095168 2022-10-08 22:04:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf @gregisenberg @sweatystartup Let's put this together!
1578867938874249216 2022-10-08 22:00:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup I was bummed to miss this.  Just snagged a place in Upstate NY.  Next time in the Catskills?
1578730922303959042 2022-10-08 12:55:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Where it Happens by @gregisenberg is a great one too.
1578726877518520320 2022-10-08 12:39:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wishdontmatter I actually hit 6-figures on a Carrd website about 2 years ago.   Crazy times.
1578725528676147201 2022-10-08 12:34:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HaydnMartin_ I'd rather just have organic conversations. Cheaper and a better chance to learn from prospective customers.
1578725421306114049 2022-10-08 12:34:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch I love that, Bryan.
1578725377832153089 2022-10-08 12:33:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje That's spot on, Sachin. Go talk to prospects and listen to their problems and needs.
1578724772111712256 2022-10-08 12:31:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom For sure. So many tools, so many options.
1578724473976795136 2022-10-08 12:30:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KreatorKitchen Boom! Love it man.
1578724445753344000 2022-10-08 12:30:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JosephSeifert22 100%, Joseph.
1578724387208843264 2022-10-08 12:29:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Exactly.   Unless you just reach out and take the money.
1578724187388383233 2022-10-08 12:29:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Check out this @heyartifact to book a full podcast interview and story with your folks.   I just bought this for my parents.
1578723571400339456 2022-10-08 12:26:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen The best.
1578723449756786688 2022-10-08 12:26:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Nailed it :)
1578722667581956096 2022-10-08 12:23:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Running a one-person business means knowing what not to work on.  And idea validation has never been faster &amp; easier:  - Domain (Google): $12/yr - Website (Carrd): $19/yr - Payment &amp; delivery (Gumroad): Free  Please spend $31 before you build something people don't want or need.
1578703040755863554 2022-10-08 11:05:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tibo_maker Great breakdown, Tibo. I appreciate being featured here.   It also acts as a reminder to continue to stay focused on these things that have yielded great results.   Appreciate you.
1578394310562684928 2022-10-07 14:38:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @creation247 A bigger flex is not finding yourself in that situation in the first place.
1578379353481674754 2022-10-07 13:38:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NafetsWirth Because that's one of 5 impostor accounts I have at the moment.
1578372375317315585 2022-10-07 13:11:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom You're killing it over there
1578367691760742400 2022-10-07 12:52:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @VineetSinha @rezzz @ericasmyname @aronkor Thank you, Mike!
1578366798285651976 2022-10-07 12:49:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Writing is just the transfer of that unique information to someone else.
1578366374497247232 2022-10-07 12:47:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Dude, you're killing it over there (as I knew you would). Not enough fitness content there.
1578364601053638661 2022-10-07 12:40:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nobill_Mic_Hael See ya there.
1578364550973632513 2022-10-07 12:40:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlperenBelgic It might.  But they should see opportunity instead of a reason to leave.
1578364376717090818 2022-10-07 12:39:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Char1ieBennett 100%. It's a pride thing for a lot of people...
1578363245953716224 2022-10-07 12:34:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DailyValueBot For sure!
1578363212675698688 2022-10-07 12:34:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zak_Klinedinst On Twitter.
1578363175300308993 2022-10-07 12:34:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess For sure. Same here, Marcus.
1578363142052012032 2022-10-07 12:34:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen It's a great place to get started, Dennis.
1578360787936092163 2022-10-07 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A lot of Twitter folks hate LinkedIn.  But there is:  - Tons of reach - An appetite for content - A thirst for business knowledge  I've racked up 162.597M+ impressions on LinkedIn.

1578008419205664768 2022-10-06 13:04:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thank you so much, Blake!
1578008217824681990 2022-10-06 13:04:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It's amazing what purpose will do for your drive.   Purposeless work, on the other hand, means accomplishing very little at a very slow pace.
1578008027558453249 2022-10-06 13:03:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki My secret to success as a CRO is that my team was much smarter than me.
1578007926572306432 2022-10-06 13:03:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour I've been telling y'all :)
1578007468592205824 2022-10-06 13:01:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @respectmywrites Thanks, Ken!
1578007429249470470 2022-10-06 13:01:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @neverproductiv Haha. It's not an "ass".
1578007341630455809 2022-10-06 13:00:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshuaKatowitz Keep going, Josh. It will feel more and more natural.
1578005542362136577 2022-10-06 12:53:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thanks, man!
1578004365742407682 2022-10-06 12:48:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew No, it's on Kajabi, but I never recommend that for people just getting started. Carrd is much easier to get traction, and then you can eventually flip to Kajabi when you know you're onto something.
1578003075385724929 2022-10-06 12:43:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wishdontmatter Thank you :)

1577998426054299656 2022-10-06 12:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1577998423462141954 2022-10-06 12:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Congrats. You just launched a course.  Maybe you won't do $90k.   But you now have an asset that can be purchased 24/7/365 by 4.95B internet-connected people.  Wild.
1577998421566394368 2022-10-06 12:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7. Execute your promotion plan  Start by including the link to the landing page in your social profiles.   Add it to your:  - LinkedIn profile - Twitter profile - Instagram  Then announce on social, your email list, and via any communities that you’re a part of.
1577998419607568387 2022-10-06 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6. Build a landing page in Carrd (Optional)  I love building out a robust landing page using Carrd.  Carrd is a simple one-page website builder that costs $19 per year. Yes, you read that right. Per year.  You get a professional-looking landing page that helps improve conversion.
1577998417665708036 2022-10-06 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5. Build out your product  Gumroad is a great place to start because it’s fast, cheap, and easy.  Choose your product name, description, &amp; price to get started.  Then head over to Canva to build out a nice product image that represents what people will get when they buy.
1577998415723642881 2022-10-06 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4. Pick your promotional channels:  - Social media - Your email list - Any community you’re in  Then, sketch out your promo content:  - Announcement - Reminder - Last call  Make sure your content answers this question:   Why should someone buy this course NOW, during my presale?
1577998413521641472 2022-10-06 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. Create a presale promotional plan:  Next, it’s time to create a promotional plan.  Start by choosing how long your presale will run.  I presold for roughly 30 days because it gave me more time to drum up interest.  Then I offered a 35% discount during the presale.
1577998411269275648 2022-10-06 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. Create course benefits &amp; outcomes:  Here’s what you want to clearly define:  - What specific problem are you solving? - What are the benefits and outcome(s) a student can expect?  Create an outline for your product that:   - Solves #1 - Delivers on #2
1577998409000259586 2022-10-06 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Choose a topic you can talk about for 30 minutes:  If you can’t talk about a topic for 30 minutes unprepared, you probably don’t know enough for a course.  No research, no reading other people’s takes, no stealing content from blogs.  Just in-depth knowledge.  Choose that.
1577998401613987842 2022-10-06 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My last course made $90,351 in 30 days.  Here's the 6-step process I used to launch it:
1577986635588927489 2022-10-06 11:38:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tibo_maker Thank you for the shout here, Tibo. Appreciate it, man.

1577705973950693376 2022-10-05 17:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are zero get-rich-quick schemes.  If someone is selling you that and you're buying? You're the fool.   Building a business online is a long game.   If you want to play, please have some patience.
1577666767366807552 2022-10-05 14:27:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Really awesome stuff here, Dickie. Making digital writing a bit more plug and play.
1577644748151685122 2022-10-05 12:59:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush It's weird how the "algorithm" always seems to impact those who don't practice, get feedback, or experiment.
1577644580174024705 2022-10-05 12:59:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 The money is simply an outcome of doing many things well, in aggregate.
1577644476528484352 2022-10-05 12:58:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Once you've decided you cannot, then you cannot. It's pretty simple.
1577644339018203136 2022-10-05 12:58:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Every founder should have a deep understanding of both sales and marketing.   These are 2 of the most difficult exec hires to eventually make.
1577642056482267137 2022-10-05 12:49:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew @IAmZachHackett Yep. I love internet business and digital marketing, so this is fun for me.
1577641919454265346 2022-10-05 12:48:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh You're living proof, Harsh.
1577641871463129093 2022-10-05 12:48:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Gr0wthSyndicate I stick to my topic because I love it.
1577641772603293696 2022-10-05 12:48:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JosephSeifert22 Yep. And now you speak to 250 people each day. Most people have never been on a stage in front of that many people in their lives.
1577641395682246656 2022-10-05 12:46:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Yep. My audience is about the same size as the city I grew up in (Cleveland, Ohio).   Pretty wild.
1577639792300675073 2022-10-05 12:40:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abilityimprove Appreciate the mention, Amaan!
1577639019349004291 2022-10-05 12:37:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tspeeg Exactly, Tyler.
1577638978257391617 2022-10-05 12:36:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess It's such a huge win-win, Marcus. You get better and your audience gets better.
1577636952605614080 2022-10-05 12:28:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianFOConnor Exactly, Brian.
1577636905478488068 2022-10-05 12:28:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @The_AliQ Interesting. I've never watched any of his stuff, tbh.
1577636850356953088 2022-10-05 12:28:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue It's the easiest way to grow and gather at the same time.
1577636800239177728 2022-10-05 12:28:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ashwin_Desh For sure, Ashwin.
1577636051895652353 2022-10-05 12:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Audience Building 101:  1. Pick a topic you're obsessed with.  2. Research it deeply each day.  3. Create content that helps others:  - Interesting observations - Common misconceptions - Step-by-step breakdowns - What will change in 5 years  An audience will naturally gather.
1577471899529093122 2022-10-05 01:33:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse @TomFrankly @JamesClear @herfirst100K @AliAbdaal Excellent thread, Jay.   I feel so fortunate to have been a guest. Thanks again for having me.   What an incredibly bright future (and present) you have. 🔥
1577418714256838656 2022-10-04 22:01:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo I wish I wasn't selling my house at this exact moment. 😒
1577415172855062536 2022-10-04 21:47:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo We had very similar problems in Nashville.  We couldn't get anyone to come to our house to do anything.  While they have leverage today, this will ebb and flow, as it always does.  Businesses that navigate this period effectively will thrive when the customer has leverage again.
1577405402295291905 2022-10-04 21:08:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby 😂
1577404317585313812 2022-10-04 21:04:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby If you move to LinkedIn, where will you learn about 10 free websites everyone should know (#8 is so good, it should be illegal!)
1577393799680167949 2022-10-04 20:22:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith @jspector Same. I just post at times that are good for me and assume that high quality content will resonate regardless of time posted.
1577379877539483654 2022-10-04 19:27:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @petergyang So glad you enjoyed it (and learned some things).
1577343590434541570 2022-10-04 17:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Part of solopreneurship is integrating revenue into your daily lifestyle.  Write email sequences? Monetize that. Project manage something? Monetize it. Delivering a newsletter? Get paid for it.  If you're already doing something, always think creatively to attach income to it.
1577297251050917889 2022-10-04 13:59:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanpaulgibson I did invest a little in early 2022, but just in getting my website moved to a new platform and cleaned up.  Social has been great, so I don't really regret not doing it sooner, but maybe :)
1577296639131373569 2022-10-04 13:56:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Great visuals here!
1577296365767598081 2022-10-04 13:55:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Thanks for the feature, my man. Some ones in here I'm totally unaware of.  Appreciate it.
1577292951658569729 2022-10-04 13:41:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Walter_Haydock Social content: Twitter post, LinkedIn post, etc.  Organic: Articles that live on a website and generate organic traffic via search engines
1577280903876837376 2022-10-04 12:54:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe We're being shepherded into groups based on what we believe, when they best thing for most people is likely a blend.
1577280314648547328 2022-10-04 12:51:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher Everything looks easy until you're the one doing it.
1577279086476808192 2022-10-04 12:46:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @girish1729 @TheHanae @thedankoe Thanks, Girish
1577279045405794305 2022-10-04 12:46:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gneuman Love that, Gabriel.
1577278995866845185 2022-10-04 12:46:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @farez Sweet. I hope to be one.
1577276988108460032 2022-10-04 12:38:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman Thank you, Tom. Hope you're well brother.
1577275367555235842 2022-10-04 12:32:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @johncdrilling Totally. Love it, John.
1577275314837000192 2022-10-04 12:31:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Sweet. Thanks, Jack.
1577275276236845059 2022-10-04 12:31:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @woodwardoge I don't actually have a great example.   I'm hoping to be one.
1577274605529858052 2022-10-04 12:29:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryandeniswalker On it, Ryan.
1577274580355674112 2022-10-04 12:28:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simplemanguide @dwilliamriggs Cool. Interviewing SEOs.
1577274549552701440 2022-10-04 12:28:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach Awesome. Thanks, AShley.
1577274520557477888 2022-10-04 12:28:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Cool. Thanks, Marcus.
1577273617418682373 2022-10-04 12:25:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You can build a high-growth, one-person business through the combo of social &amp; organic search.  - Social: quick spikes, declines fast - Organic: slow-building, grows over time  In 2023 I'll invest $30k+ in SEO to augment my social.  Would a public-facing dashboard be interesting?
1577272587113336835 2022-10-04 12:21:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WrongsToWrite @aaditsh @therealbmark @andrehaykaljr @OneJKMolina @LoftedLearning @blackhatwizardd @Shane___Martin @SeanAnthonySays @ecomchasedimond Thank you so much, Dakota.  Really appreciate you including me on this list.  🙌
1577075307944607746 2022-10-03 23:17:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse @sivers Wow. What a guest man. Maybe my favorite author. Congrats on the big interview.
1576981207618920450 2022-10-03 17:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone has unique knowledge.  Here's how to sell it:  - All at once: A course - Dripped over time: A subscription - Discussed with other people: A private community - Learned with other people: Cohort-based coaching  One set of knowledge.  A diverse set of revenue options.
1576911252160450561 2022-10-03 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Something you can "do in your sleep" is worth $10k+ to someone else.
1576749467612884993 2022-10-03 01:42:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @claytonchambrs Just left!

1576732226523316226 2022-10-03 00:33:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stepanhlinka Ok. Votes are in and it's you, brother.  Thanks for the massive mention.  Your growth is insane. Keep up the great work!
1576731916035768320 2022-10-03 00:32:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lilmac024 Haha. Appreciate you, man. :)
1576722074961588225 2022-10-02 23:53:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stepanhlinka Appreciate it :)   I just got done with an 8-hour drive and had 4k new Twitter followers. I think you're the reason.  Amazing!   Keep going, brother.
1576721875992203264 2022-10-02 23:52:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thatroblennon Feel like just driving back and forth across state lines then.
1576721625650671616 2022-10-02 23:51:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jawnquincyadams I just saw this, but 4,000 seems like a lot. Could be though!
1576721347786330112 2022-10-02 23:50:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JarvisKa @stelmo I might just drive across the country at this rate.
1576721032417017857 2022-10-02 23:49:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oliviercantin "Follow for hot content."
1576720889647099905 2022-10-02 23:48:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Reid_HF Thanks, brother!
1576720869010731010 2022-10-02 23:48:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Was it you?? :)
1576720838480785408 2022-10-02 23:48:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IamTiffMarshall Thank you!
1576715142707888128 2022-10-02 23:25:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stepanhlinka Thanks, man! Appreciate the mention.
1576713846496014336 2022-10-02 23:20:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GoDoodlingo I love it :)
1576713819375534080 2022-10-02 23:20:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexandraAllen_ @JustinSaaS Thank you!
1576564200062832646 2022-10-02 13:26:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One-person diversified media companies are the new modern business.  Grow a social channel, build a large email list, and then offer multiple products at multiple price points:  - Subscriptions - Sponsorships - Coaching - Affiliates - Courses - Etc.  Tiny business. Big revenue.
1576190948781924352 2022-10-01 12:43:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CompoundingCed Derek Sivers Pieter Levels
1576190831505321988 2022-10-01 12:42:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf It's a total unlock when you realize this.  It gives you permission to try things that you don't believe you are qualified for.   And even if you "fail" you still fail forward.
1576189966954074112 2022-10-01 12:39:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GreenHamoon Mostly below average.
1576189929784168448 2022-10-01 12:38:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MalkanKaya Absolutely, Kaya.
1576189898637250560 2022-10-01 12:38:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen For sure, Dennis.
1576188782465925123 2022-10-01 12:34:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The most permission-inducing realization I've ever had is that my business heroes are average people.
1576180404465565702 2022-10-01 12:01:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn Keep it simple. Give your prospects fewer choices, not more. Start by generating visits via social, and see what content resonates with your audience. Then, after some time, invest in SEO-optimized content that delivers more information on those topics.  Hope that helps!
1575961407367311360 2022-09-30 21:30:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_mikeVideo @typeshare_co @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 This is awesome. @dickiebush and @Nicolascole77 - check this out. Really well done.

1575958908363214848 2022-09-30 21:20:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alishaconlinh @stevenshills20 Appreciate you, Alisha!
1575935532974362625 2022-09-30 19:48:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse I was just watching your interview with Chris Do.  Here's what I liked about it:  - Thoughtful - Articulate - Confident - Curious  You don't flex or try too hard. You just approach the interview like someone who is genuinely interested in your guest.
1575912566681145344 2022-09-30 18:16:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heydannymiranda @SahilBloom Looks like a solid ep, Danny. Will check it out this weekend.
1575878460895301633 2022-09-30 16:01:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GuruAnaerobic @paulcanetti @dvassallo @JesseOberoi Yeah, I think this is all true.  Living in America and traveling frequently to Europe, I do get the sense that ultra-processed is more common here.   But again, could just be my perception and not rooted in fact.
1575874666245128192 2022-09-30 15:46:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @GuruAnaerobic @JesseOberoi I think it's also a heavier reliance on ultra-processed foods which are directly linked to obesity.  According to this article, Americans have a diet of 60% ultra-processed while other countries are 25% to 40%.   https://t.co/1OeXbESWRy
1575840559989755904 2022-09-30 13:30:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Let's see if we can find another business in today's thread...
1575831136378683392 2022-09-30 12:53:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen This is awesome, Dennis.
1575831051678556160 2022-09-30 12:52:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder I'm all about diversification over "eggs in one basket" mentality.
1575828899518640128 2022-09-30 12:44:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexandraAllen_ Awesome. I would love if the issue had a major impact on women founders. That would be fantastic!
1575825448528859137 2022-09-30 12:30:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @johncdrilling I've had nice coaches on my journey, so I try and provide the same service for others.
1575824348946075649 2022-09-30 12:26:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thechrisbaumann See you there, Chris.

1575823803770228738 2022-09-30 12:24:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach Thank you so much, Ashley!
1575822793459077120 2022-09-30 12:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @myown_techbrand @arvidkahl I didn't mean the founder personally. I meant their business.

1575531658924724231 2022-09-29 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'll cross 350M+ social media impressions for my business in 2022.  And all I do is share 2 thoughts per day on 2 social channels.  Imagine not taking advantage of this time we're in.  You owe it to your future business to start sharing right now.
1575499777239764994 2022-09-29 14:56:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Every great writer needs a great warm up. Enjoyed this one, Dickie.
1575463195355107328 2022-09-29 12:31:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoftedLearning Absolutely.   I wasn't suggesting this was an optimal plan, but simply that people toss their hat in the ring and get started in any way, shape, or form.
1575462283576229888 2022-09-29 12:27:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshuaKatowitz 100%, Josh. That's a very valid point.
1575462222326816771 2022-09-29 12:27:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l All of those things require starting, which is what I'm advocating for here. Most people will research and research and research.  It's great to get in the game to start understanding it.
1575462048741441538 2022-09-29 12:26:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TizzieHerman Ideas are a dime a dozen.
1575461958568103936 2022-09-29 12:26:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @johncdrilling Just get started with the most simple tools and get more complex over time.
1575460937607389184 2022-09-29 12:22:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @acagamic Of course. But if you're really an entrepreneur, you'll build 100 airplanes in your time.   You likely won't spend your entire life researching how to build one perfectly.
1575460770032373760 2022-09-29 12:21:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CompoundingCed Whatever you already know how to use.
1575460585038352384 2022-09-29 12:20:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sachdevasampark Literally, the best.
1575460555225169921 2022-09-29 12:20:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YasshhTilekar You have to. Learning comes with action.
1575460509490581505 2022-09-29 12:20:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gethebizz Nailed it.
1575459632688111617 2022-09-29 12:17:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Imagine that instead of researching your idea, designing a logo, trialing 7 tools, and talking to 10 friends, you just built a simple landing page and started promoting your business and the problem it solves.  You might fail, but you'll learn 1000x faster than procrastinating.

1575195256743940098 2022-09-28 18:46:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheFlowAgency Ain't that the truth, man.
1575193251241291777 2022-09-28 18:38:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @romaindewolff It is. Wild huh?
1575188353946767360 2022-09-28 18:19:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Literally, get it right one time. The rest will come if you harness that learning.
1575187443493773312 2022-09-28 18:15:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere So many I can't keep track
1575186859457933313 2022-09-28 18:13:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkUmeh Appreciate it Mark

1575186002640896002 2022-09-28 18:09:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza I learned them in my late 30s. All good!
1575185960316567552 2022-09-28 18:09:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess That's the great part, Marcus.
1575184889045024775 2022-09-28 18:05:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1575184886704529416 2022-09-28 18:05:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I wrote about these 5 rules at a much deeper level here.  If you want to build a slightly different life, give it a read.  (read time: 4 minutes)   https://t.co/FCFrMMXCv8
1575184884766834688 2022-09-28 18:05:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Increase yourself  Front-load effort to build products that pay you in a recurring fashion.  With each purchase, the hours you spent building equal out to a higher hourly rate.  Build once, sell one thousand times.
1575184882275422209 2022-09-28 18:05:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Replicate yourself  Creating an online business means taking advantage of global E-commerce, which is absolutely wild.  The assets that you create are available all over the world, 24 hours a day, to those 4.95B internet-connected people.  Those assets live forever.
1575184880144621568 2022-09-28 18:05:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Invest in yourself  The amount of internet tools available to people has never been more open and available.  You can build your entire tech stack (landing page, email automation, blogging, products) on sites like Gumroad for free.  Build a toolset that allows you to thrive.
1575184877762363401 2022-09-28 18:05:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Diversify yourself  We're all familiar with the phrase, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket", but that is precisely what the average person does with their income.  Diversify the way you earn:  - Coaching - Courses - Community - Subscriptions - Sponsors - SaaS
1575184875707142146 2022-09-28 18:05:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Scale yourself  It's important to find a way to move from earning 33% of the day (9 to 5) to earning 100% of the day.  "You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. An army of robots is freely available..."  - Naval
1575184873693880322 2022-09-28 18:05:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Working 60 hours per week for 45 years is a tough pill to swallow.  Instead, think about your life using these 5 new rules:
1575177678856265728 2022-09-28 17:36:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fitwithrashid Wow. I absolutely love that sentence. Great share here, Rashid.
1575175528343969792 2022-09-28 17:28:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen So glad it was a massive win for you, my man. Kudos to you for the amazing book. Cheers, Dennis.
1575169263781953539 2022-09-28 17:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's difficult to build a work ethic without the right environment.  While everyone talks about "hard work" and "outworking the competition", it's tough to force this behavior.  Curate a high-performance environment and the behavior is a more likely outcome.
1575099824701313024 2022-09-28 12:27:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Nice thread here, Matt.  I'm going deep on SEO next month to start diversifying from social.
1575097832540803072 2022-09-28 12:19:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KrisOgrabek Thanks, Kris!
1575097795073417218 2022-09-28 12:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach Nailed it here, Ashley.
1575095623350898692 2022-09-28 12:10:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ashwin_Desh It sure does, Ashwin.
1575095490710220800 2022-09-28 12:10:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple Love that last line. Smart.
1575095143455227905 2022-09-28 12:08:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Stop searching for a mentor.  Instead, attract a high-quality mentor by making yourself someone worth spending time on.
1574928111590055936 2022-09-28 01:04:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf @sivers Have you read his new book? 🤌🏻
1574830628947763201 2022-09-27 18:37:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jjeffrose Love this, Jeff. Thanks for the mention!
1574808148346650633 2022-09-27 17:08:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aminaeily @_Glasp No, but I'll check them out!

1574807633298685965 2022-09-27 17:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dylan_Secrest It certainly is, Dylan.
1574807599291195400 2022-09-27 17:06:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThomasKStrider True story, Thomas.
1574807337956777990 2022-09-27 17:05:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Same.
1574806883868835840 2022-09-27 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The daily news is miserable.  So I surround myself with:  - Great books - High performers - Uplifting podcasts - A positive Twitter audience  I'm going to brainwash myself before the world can.
1574745689518546945 2022-09-27 13:00:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge There is a really great book that talks about this called, "The Second Mountain" by David Brooks.
1574745336211709952 2022-09-27 12:58:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ "The Super Bowl is won in the preseason." - I love that, Matt.
1574743245078384641 2022-09-27 12:50:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kyler_Nixon I just present the option in the course and provide simple talking points. Nothing too complicated tbh.
1574743151528808448 2022-09-27 12:49:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @30DayThrill Correct!
1574740330804441088 2022-09-27 12:38:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @telmeri Average Revenue Per User
1574738673022771202 2022-09-27 12:32:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew I think smaller accounts have a hypothesis that they just need to make 1 sale of a high-ticket item, but underestimate how difficult that is.  I'm sure there are people that disagree and small accounts that make high-ticket sales, but in general, I like affordable products.
1574737850419011585 2022-09-27 12:28:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kaolti That's the game.
1574737821239164928 2022-09-27 12:28:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadifernandes Appreciate it, Aadi.
1574737796631515141 2022-09-27 12:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Thanks, Dennis!
1574736914309079044 2022-09-27 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Just crossed $1.5M in online course sales at a $130.25 ARPU.  Turns out, not everything has to be high-ticket.  Until you build tremendous social capital, I'd recommend keeping it affordable and high-quality.  Build that trust and play the long game.

1574556868386619409 2022-09-27 00:29:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector @ngerdau My man 🙌 Congratulations ❤️
1574494541897515020 2022-09-26 20:22:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ @AlexHormozi Thank you, man!   I appreciate that so much.
1574489089822408724 2022-09-26 20:00:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DanielRSchatzl It depends on what you mean by leads, but I drive about 1,000 unique visitors to my course landing pages each day.
1574447237027237889 2022-09-26 17:14:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @acapland Mine is around 3.5%, yes.
1574445865623818242 2022-09-26 17:08:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_robwilloughby I'm so glad man!
1574445773164511232 2022-09-26 17:08:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThomasKStrider Thank you!
1574442809746153474 2022-09-26 16:56:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you can find a way to drive 100 people to a landing page each day, you can probably make 2-3 sales of a lower-cost product.  If that product is $150, you're making $100k+ per year.  Become known for one thing, build one product, and drive that traffic.  Start there.
1574389191391207426 2022-09-26 13:23:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush 3 Coffees. Check.
1574389085992517632 2022-09-26 13:23:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak I became a solopreneur to spend more time with my wife. I don't need to build a unicorn to do that.
1574388938487336968 2022-09-26 13:22:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Not only is it fulfilling, but the lessons learned on an unpredictable path are so valuable.
1574388696165515264 2022-09-26 13:21:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Most people look to others for permission or validation, when taking action and letting the market tell you, is the best way forward.
1574383737315684352 2022-09-26 13:01:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge @inboundrevenue I think you just stumbled onto a new paid product, Blake.
1574383144014422016 2022-09-26 12:59:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Sweet. Will text you :)
1574379552171761664 2022-09-26 12:45:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Yep.  My goal is to reduce misery and increase satisfaction.
1574379433846358019 2022-09-26 12:44:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge I'd love to build a business dashboard in Excel - Got anything for that?
1574378703945015296 2022-09-26 12:41:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets For sure.   Much more flexible.
1574378648748101632 2022-09-26 12:41:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KalimoLeboela Love that, Kalimo.
1574378623384985605 2022-09-26 12:41:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach Saving money is me playing defense.  Continuing to invest in audience + community + products is playing offense.  I like a combination of both.
1574378392492953603 2022-09-26 12:40:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Keep going, Dennis!
1574376522844176386 2022-09-26 12:33:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom For sure.  Holding on to my preferred lifestyle is both motivating and drives a bit of fear.
1574376061873360896 2022-09-26 12:31:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarleyMcBride_ I'll take it.
1574376007183769603 2022-09-26 12:31:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiharikaSodhi Same. That would be taking this lifestyle away!
1574375957955313665 2022-09-26 12:30:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Probably my main driver.
1574375906042429443 2022-09-26 12:30:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gillianography We all are.
1574375447541997576 2022-09-26 12:28:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wishdontmatter Just all of my customers. That would be odd though!
1574375407356416002 2022-09-26 12:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thechrisbaumann That's it right there.
1574375379225157634 2022-09-26 12:28:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OzolinsJanis Glad it resonates with people, Janis!
1574375329048956929 2022-09-26 12:28:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l Thanks, Shushant. I hope so.
1574374521003442176 2022-09-26 12:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My biggest motivation as a solopreneur is never having this lifestyle taken away from me.
1574095986288340992 2022-09-25 17:58:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Appreciate that, man.  What's your favorite?
1574095903379668994 2022-09-25 17:58:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshuaKatowitz So natural, and works so much better, Josh.
1574095852561383427 2022-09-25 17:57:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue Same, Sean.
1574095836170096641 2022-09-25 17:57:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Thank you, Katelyn. Funny enough, I think we all start this way. Just some of us eventually find our own path.
1574095137822720000 2022-09-25 17:55:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Digital marketing &amp; craft IPAs
1574094651287642114 2022-09-25 17:53:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Thank you, brother. Much appreciated.
1574094537823248384 2022-09-25 17:52:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oseikodie_ Appreciate it!
1574094521075638272 2022-09-25 17:52:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaxx_sam Thanks!
1574093979951456259 2022-09-25 17:50:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Read the entire breakdown here:   https://t.co/U3KyElDKvi
1574093978672287744 2022-09-25 17:50:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I wrote about how to build a one-person business that stands out in the sea of sameness.   It has 4 parts:  1. Embrace Your Obsession 2. Develop Unique Knowledge 3. Build Distribution By Studying People 4. Scale Using Compounding, Daily Media
1574093977397100545 2022-09-25 17:50:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most people fail at distribution because they copy what they see popular accounts doing online, but without the benefit of years of work and brand recognition.
1574042984852688899 2022-09-25 14:27:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @devinmcpaul Thank you! I'll take "menace" :)
1574027536945799168 2022-09-25 13:26:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GabeMarusca Thanks, Gabe!
1574025296684236804 2022-09-25 13:17:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The more I've done things to impress others, the less impressed I am with myself.
1574021566379196416 2022-09-25 13:02:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmZachHackett That's 100% true. People share systems with me all of the time.  I take them and make them my own by transforming them into things that actually work for me.
1574019879979679745 2022-09-25 12:55:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thechrisbaumann Love that, Chris.
1574019814280105987 2022-09-25 12:55:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Agreed. It's about understanding that all advice requires context.
1574017182333386753 2022-09-25 12:45:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadifernandes Exactly, Aadi.
1574017155233980416 2022-09-25 12:45:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Exactly, man.  Use it, but be aware of how different journey's go.
1574016375420604418 2022-09-25 12:42:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere A lot of people are really looking for:  - permission - validation - feedback
1574016257388691457 2022-09-25 12:41:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheAmineAouragh Correct. Too much copy/paste of advice rather than realizing it requires context.
1574016176354742278 2022-09-25 12:41:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets This is an excellent comment, Ant.
1574016121379889155 2022-09-25 12:41:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith @sivers That's right. All advice requires a tremendous amount of context.
1574016024415985667 2022-09-25 12:40:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkhundmiri @justinmooretfam @arvidkahl @KateBour Appreciate it, Mustafa.   Just crossed 51k subs this morning 💪
1574015515554627586 2022-09-25 12:38:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I try to share the best advice I have with other solopreneurs.  But you shouldn't follow anyone's advice (mine included) blindly only to find out that their luck, timing, or privilege isn't on your side.  Advice is more of a guidepost, and less of a treasure map.

1573670584470454273 2022-09-24 13:47:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maxclark @blakeaburge @tillerhq Oh my. This looks crazy valuable.  Thanks for sharing, Max!   Looking into it now.
1573668790860234755 2022-09-24 13:40:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrunoZdenik About to!
1573668758035521536 2022-09-24 13:40:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram @SteveOnSpeed Ain't it though, man?
1573668730130792448 2022-09-24 13:40:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Dude, I'm so happy for you.   Congrats, Teddy!  Rooting for you every day.
1573661303704588288 2022-09-24 13:11:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Improve your network 1% every day.   When you need it, it'll be there.
1573661192878493697 2022-09-24 13:10:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe My non-internet friends and my parents still don't know what I do.   When I explain it, I just sound like a lunatic.  I guess that's alright.
1573660026488619010 2022-09-24 13:06:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ashwin_Desh Love those, Ashwin.
1573658140318617601 2022-09-24 12:58:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cj_zZZz 100%. It's about accomplishments too.
1573658087994658818 2022-09-24 12:58:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Love that, Marcus. So true.
1573658038287876096 2022-09-24 12:58:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Great addition, Dhruv.
1573658003730997251 2022-09-24 12:57:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tspeeg That's right. Take control and create your own leverage.
1573657947540013058 2022-09-24 12:57:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l Love those, Shushant.
1573657802974941184 2022-09-24 12:57:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Same here :)
1573657706464002049 2022-09-24 12:56:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge My wife and I do our financial meeting every Saturday morning.  Our spreadsheet is a bit different, so I'm going to test drive this and will shoot you a note, if you're open to it?
1573656153782976514 2022-09-24 12:50:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5 things you will never regret:  1. Building a business 2. Landing your first customer 3. Quitting a job that makes you miserable 4. Reaching your previous salary w/ your biz 5. Taking a week off to celebrate who you've become  None of these are easy.  All of them are rewarding.
1573452522047807488 2022-09-23 23:21:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @devinmcpaul Great thread. Thanks!
1573429581587046407 2022-09-23 21:50:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ExploreWaPod @WrongsToWrite Thank you!
1573287368261509123 2022-09-23 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The harsh truth behind why people fail at social media:  1. You're not as clever as you think 2. You use a tone that turns people off 3. You share meaningless platitudes  Tomorrow, I'll show 50,897 people how to stop making these mistakes.  Join us here:  https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
1573056079705133061 2022-09-22 21:06:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 "The road to hell is paved with adverbs." 😂  Brilliant.
1572999458677313539 2022-09-22 17:21:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kebiru_Momodu_ Always, Kay.
1572999421486317569 2022-09-22 17:21:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Absolutely.
1572999387416231937 2022-09-22 17:20:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @s4m4rn0ld Haha. True story :)
1572999228510638081 2022-09-22 17:20:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DivvyUp_King @HeroJourneyOn If nobody wants to listen, they won't. The market works well that way!
1572994929793839105 2022-09-22 17:03:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Potential unpopular opinion, but telling people they shouldn't share on social media unless they have a bunch of experience misses the whole point. The market decides who to listen to, not some preconceived notion of what a successful person looks like.
1572972701165424640 2022-09-22 15:34:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush While I don't technically journal daily, I do share my thoughts into the world. Such clarification from doing so.
1572941577999319040 2022-09-22 13:31:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Gong and Outreach are pretty masterful at it, IMO.
1572941453038583809 2022-09-22 13:30:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamtomelliot @agazdecki I always liked hiring people who had actively taken part in building early-stage startups rather than people who had spent many years at mature companies.
1572939797886369798 2022-09-22 13:24:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Read it out loud. If it doesn't sound like you, write it again.
1572939730878369797 2022-09-22 13:23:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Brussel Sprouts.
1572939655108239365 2022-09-22 13:23:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe And the best way to do this is t o surround yourself with a diverse crew of artists, entrepreneurs and athletes.
1572939518101127171 2022-09-22 13:22:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Early-stage startups especially. So many of them hire optimizers rather than builders. In the beginning, nearly everyone has to be a builder.
1572939209920630785 2022-09-22 13:21:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Their whole executive team should be online. Some companies are masterful at this.
1572932590880841731 2022-09-22 12:55:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder 127% more fulfilling.
1572932548136681474 2022-09-22 12:55:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @worth_parker I love to hear it man!
1572928634306035713 2022-09-22 12:39:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @The_Skill_Lab 1. Unimportant obligations 2. I'd have hired a VA sooner 3. Keep tools and tech simple
1572928297901916161 2022-09-22 12:38:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmZachHackett Thank you, Zach!
1572928236535021568 2022-09-22 12:38:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @har8narayan Probably not. I'd like to just make what I made this year, but work less.
1572928179102425088 2022-09-22 12:37:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew I love that I have very few obligations!
1572928108424237056 2022-09-22 12:37:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess Get fit. Give a lot of money away. Feed hungry people for the holidays.
1572928001586724864 2022-09-22 12:37:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj That's right. I can get a small raise by writing an email.
1572927965121347584 2022-09-22 12:37:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l Thanks, Shushant!
1572927374077067264 2022-09-22 12:34:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @The_Skill_Lab 1. Writing well 2. Consistency
1572927304162058242 2022-09-22 12:34:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Thank you brother.
1572927249879371778 2022-09-22 12:34:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom True story. Stuff is getting outta control.
1572926913706098688 2022-09-22 12:32:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Congrats on the great growth, man.
1572925789548736512 2022-09-22 12:28:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour I'm his favorite employee. That's the secret.

1572679027089092608 2022-09-21 20:07:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Pele_sun I really want to read this soon.
1572678856200388611 2022-09-21 20:07:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AleksBrankov I own it!
1572678792782422016 2022-09-21 20:06:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gecitjeerd One of my faves.
1572678755025571840 2022-09-21 20:06:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheAnswerYes @SimplyAzodo I own it!
1572678627245817856 2022-09-21 20:06:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheTaxlRose Second vote for this. Might have to pick it up. Thanks!
1572678281899417607 2022-09-21 20:04:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spontaneousbkpk It's one of my favorite books ever.
1572671051271929857 2022-09-21 19:36:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What's a book nobody talks about, that every entrepreneur should read?
1572661973514330114 2022-09-21 19:00:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imjeremiahrizzo @amandanat Haha.
1572645797325324288 2022-09-21 17:55:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amandanat "I'm a one-man $20M machine!"   Oh yeah - why does your website have 45 employees?  "I just cracked $2M this year!"  Why does your Stripe screenshot say $127k?  "I grew the business from $0 to $40M ARR!"  You joined at $30M, I can see it on your LinkedIn profile.
1572645272513314817 2022-09-21 17:53:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Thanks, brother.  A small thank you note was the least I could do, ya know?
1572644277901209600 2022-09-21 17:49:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amandanat I don't actually look for proof that they are credible.  Instead, I look for obvious lies.  "I spent 5,000 hours studying landing pages last year..."  Oh yeah? 13 hours a day, every single day of the year?  Cool story dude.
1572636543721869312 2022-09-21 17:19:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyMohit_ He certainly is a good one.
1572636509823442953 2022-09-21 17:18:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MalkanKaya Agreed, Kaya.
1572636460532264961 2022-09-21 17:18:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gethebizz And her family.
1572636401405165573 2022-09-21 17:18:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @willstew Haha. Probably.
1572636376922742784 2022-09-21 17:18:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tspeeg Love this, Tyler. Thanks for sharing it, man.
1572627316357971971 2022-09-21 16:42:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Floyd Mayweather on the power of the creator:  “I can fight a fighter right now &amp; guarantee myself $35M. Or me and Logan Paul can go out, entertain, have fun &amp; make $100M or more."   "$35M for 12 rounds or $100M for 6 rounds — big difference.”  Attention pays.

1572573090294661128 2022-09-21 13:06:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour I wrote this guide about it actually:  https://t.co/TwgI63zvhX

1572567747774779392 2022-09-21 12:45:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimonJalbert I think that if you don't have an audience, this is a pretty decent way to start growing one.
1572563669460066304 2022-09-21 12:29:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KevinRatemoz Thanks, Kevin. I appreciate that, man.
1572563640636829697 2022-09-21 12:29:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VManoj87 Exactly, Manoj.
1572563618969059328 2022-09-21 12:29:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikeying77 Correct. Nailed it, Mike.

1572563567769178113 2022-09-21 12:29:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tashfene That's right, Tashfeen,
1572563532843216897 2022-09-21 12:28:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewglynch It's good to start by focusing on one, but if it's easy enough to distribute, go for it.
1572563470935273472 2022-09-21 12:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach For sure, Ashley. The easiest way.
1572562574096449537 2022-09-21 12:25:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A simple way to find customers:  - Write an article for your website - Chop it up &amp; put it on LinkedIn - Double it up on Twitter - Use it to answer questions on Quora &amp; IndieHackers  Look for which channel brings some in high-quality prospects.  Then double down and repeat.

1572277828971888642 2022-09-20 17:33:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The less you spend inside of the tactical part of your business, the more time you can spend "big picture thinking".  Love that one.
1572270155580993536 2022-09-20 17:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to think of a business idea:  1. Difficult way: Think of a product  2. Better way: Solve your own problem  3. Best way: Design a category where you're the winner  You can win with all of these, but number 3 is key for creator-entrepreneurs.

1572200960386125825 2022-09-20 12:28:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Having a personal take is often the missing ingredient here.
1572200908229951489 2022-09-20 12:28:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WithNachit That's right, Nachit.
1572200869919330306 2022-09-20 12:27:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadifernandes Thanks, Aadi.

1572200200256606214 2022-09-20 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to write unique content for your niche:  - What is something everyone believes, that you don't? - What is something nobody is talking about but should be? - What are big mistakes people make, that they are oblivious to? - What change is happening that people aren't noticing?
1572015433221300224 2022-09-20 00:11:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Congrats, Daniel.   Your content has deeply influenced my entire journey.
1571968183451668481 2022-09-19 21:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse @jspector @life_authors For context, I don't think yearly is somehow "bad".   For my personality, allowing quarterly optionality i.e. "I don't want to do this anymore" is simply required for my personality type.  If you're 100% all in...go for it.
1571967677039775744 2022-09-19 21:01:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Same. That's why all 35+ of my previous issues are available on my website.

1571928940247236613 2022-09-19 18:27:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @noahzender If churn becomes high or your product is deemed low priority (demand in market shifts or recession) it's nice to have additional streams.  This is why I have one-time products, and the upsell to MRR. Gives me flexibility for sure.
1571915491991777280 2022-09-19 17:33:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew I agree with this.   Trade your time for money until you deeply understand customer problems.  Then address them with a product.
1571914518032273409 2022-09-19 17:30:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VincasStonys Thanks, Vincas.
1571914485199409152 2022-09-19 17:29:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @noahzender Which one?
1571914437602455553 2022-09-19 17:29:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AkBakhshi Thanks, Akbar.
1571914388029718534 2022-09-19 17:29:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Get after it, Jarek!
1571914354219700227 2022-09-19 17:29:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dave_Geoghegan_ Exactly. Why not expand out as often as possible?
1571914254999224320 2022-09-19 17:28:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_heydave Thanks, Dave!
1571907780897808386 2022-09-19 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A nice solopreneur revenue stack:  - One-time payments: Digital courses - Recurring revenue: Subscription product - Time for money: Cohort-based coaching - Paid to write: Newsletter sponsorships - Paid to recommend: Affiliate deals  5 small bets means reduced risk.

1571846046187143168 2022-09-19 12:57:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush My wife and I do the same for small business owners until we know them by name.  My buddy taught me this with bartenders in NYC.   Lots of free drinks :)
1571845878734028800 2022-09-19 12:57:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Seeing small actions result in big outcomes over time is one of the most gratifying experiences there is.
1571845725255868416 2022-09-19 12:56:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Building your business is a lot like standup comedy.  When you start, you mimic and imitate your favorites.  It's once you find your true voice and path, that speaks to your specific customers, then you truly shine.
1571842574683365377 2022-09-19 12:44:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Haha. Best comment.
1571842328985325574 2022-09-19 12:43:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 It's also really useful to go back and read critical points in time and milestones hit. You'll start to see that the best outcomes were often a result of many good things strung together.
1571842038995222528 2022-09-19 12:42:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom That's it right there.  Find the 20% and go wild.
1571839485142351875 2022-09-19 12:31:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder That's right. Any time there are two parties involved, hard work isn't enough...
1571839349918142467 2022-09-19 12:31:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen I love that, Dennis :)
1571839219219169280 2022-09-19 12:30:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChristineCarril Yep. But isn't that basically everything worth doing?
1571837391530328067 2022-09-19 12:23:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Thank you, man!
1571837359276130305 2022-09-19 12:23:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Totally, Jarek. Love that.
1571837310773170178 2022-09-19 12:23:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randomrecruiter Yep. Pareto over everything. That should be on a t-shirt.
1571837222621511682 2022-09-19 12:22:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pauldm For sure, Paul.
1571836003689631745 2022-09-19 12:18:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CEOApeHunter Nice!
1571835979840864259 2022-09-19 12:17:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Taylor_Street_ Always.
1571835959351689216 2022-09-19 12:17:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WithNachit Thanks, Nachit.
1571835927953039360 2022-09-19 12:17:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadifernandes 100%. Hard work doesn't guarantee a strong outcome.
1571835867433418760 2022-09-19 12:17:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Nailing it here, Dhruv.
1571835410501730304 2022-09-19 12:15:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You aren't rewarded for hard work.  You're rewarded for creating something of value.  So don't work unnecessarily hard on something that you haven't validated people want.  Instead, run small experiments over &amp; over again until you have a few strong outcomes.  Then double down.
1571658202986553344 2022-09-19 00:31:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado Stay safe, my man. Fingers crossed hard on this one.
1571565906593038340 2022-09-18 18:24:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Avishai_Bitton Sure. Slice and dice it however.  Just one of a million ways to hit the target.
1571562668779270146 2022-09-18 18:11:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkhundmiri "I tried for a day and it didn't work."
1571562552571887616 2022-09-18 18:11:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @madsbrodt Exactly.  Million ways to get there!

1571561892195319810 2022-09-18 18:08:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Of course you can.  You already are.
1571561374664335360 2022-09-18 18:06:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are 4,950,000,000 internet-connected people.  Can you find 4 each day that will pay you $70?  If so, you have a $100k business.  Definitely not easy, but also not as daunting as you might think.

1571504765493989376 2022-09-18 14:21:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Procrastination, while challenging, can also be a feature rather than a bug.  Often, it's good to listen to it. Interested to give this a read, Blake.
1571490712549576704 2022-09-18 13:25:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 One more to think about:  Incentivize: Make your customer base your biggest and most motivated sales team.  You'll have a lot less work to do.
1571490492835155968 2022-09-18 13:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak I noticed that "mass applying via Indeed" isn't included.

Great for groups, local meetups, and any other organization.  https://t.co/J1OqDHGvc2

1571485875959205896 2022-09-18 13:06:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Hyper-fast engagement  Engaging with top accounts is crucial.  I use @blackmagic_so to create my list of important accounts.

1571485868254175235 2022-09-18 13:06:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Auto-plugging for subscribers  @Hypefury will also auto-plug your newsletter.  - Select the number of likes/engagements. - Create your custom message to add-on  Voila.

One great way to get more engagement is to Retweet yourself.  I RT myself 9 hours later using @hypefury  The best part? They Un-Retweet 24 hours later.  That keeps your profile nice and clean.  https://t.co/O9A7ec4LLJ

1571166536613732354 2022-09-17 15:57:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @R_ubenBuijs Nope.
1571165575635779585 2022-09-17 15:53:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @supermode_ @barrettjoneill Not sure there’s a one-size-fits-all answer. Experiment and see what works. Could be 4 months or a year!
1571165294298632202 2022-09-17 15:52:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amandanat Haha. I don’t even know what that means

1571134127394680838 2022-09-17 13:49:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ I just started but I'm enjoying the clarity with which he describes where I'm at in my life and what my purpose is.
1571129384823836673 2022-09-17 13:30:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theactionpod @AlexAndBooks_ I just started it and I'm really enjoying it.
1571128413942910977 2022-09-17 13:26:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Do the opposite of what everyone does and get the opposite of what everyone gets.  It's so obvious that it isn't.
1571128231927107585 2022-09-17 13:25:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Have you read The Second Mountain by David Brooks, Alex?
1571128106408202243 2022-09-17 13:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Haha. This is how I feel daily about my little one-person business. 😂
1571127245556838400 2022-09-17 13:21:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pbasilstrength For sure. I've needed to hear the same stuff about 100 times before I start taking action sometimes.
1571126640285224960 2022-09-17 13:19:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UnderstoryBard Agreed. I repurpose emails every once in a while as well.
1571126367659630593 2022-09-17 13:18:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AshwinMStanley I'm sure lots of people do. But I don't need to hit a home run with every post. Just small, compound returns over time.
1571124643729403904 2022-09-17 13:11:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AnderrDavib Eso es correcto. Y hace que escribir contenido sea mucho más fácil.

1571123496117481472 2022-09-17 13:06:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii That's what I think as well, Dave...
1571123462521122818 2022-09-17 13:06:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyAmna1 Exactly. It takes a long time for these messages to resonate.

1571123289426366466 2022-09-17 13:05:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thearjunmitra Thanks, Arjun!
1571122303009804288 2022-09-17 13:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're publishing content daily, remember:  - 75% of your followers didn't see it - 80% of your followers won't remember - 100% of your new followers never saw it  Tweak and repurpose your best stuff often.  Nobody remembers your content like you remember your content.
1571121587616886784 2022-09-17 12:59:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge This is super helpful as I plan my financial systems for 2023. Thanks, brother!
1571118209784483846 2022-09-17 12:45:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby @hutchison15 I just started here, honestly:   https://t.co/TmgRZw1CB2

1570938916731224066 2022-09-17 00:53:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby @hutchison15 Hey Jack - I felt the same way about Notion for awhile.   Then I just started using it, testing out free templates, trashing what didn’t feel right, etc.   Eventually it became my go to for everything. X

1570446443348893696 2022-09-15 16:16:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timgabedesign Anywhere between 90%-95% works well for me.  A combo of courses and other revenue streams that don't require time for money.

1570027114866302976 2022-09-14 12:30:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Haha. You and Sahil on the "luck surface area" train today.
1570027008758845442 2022-09-14 12:29:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom One of my favorite terms!
1570026941310464008 2022-09-14 12:29:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WithNachit Same thing.
1570026896712421378 2022-09-14 12:29:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimonJalbert Almost zero.
1570026872771153920 2022-09-14 12:29:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l Nailed it, Shushant.
1570026818136322048 2022-09-14 12:28:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmZachHackett 100%. An asset you control.
1570026539089010688 2022-09-14 12:27:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadifernandes Thanks, Aadi.
1570025858630578177 2022-09-14 12:25:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You can't control inflation or being laid off.  But you can control how you're perceived in the world, and in turn, how many new opportunities come your way in the future.  If you're not sharing your knowledge and learnings online, the time to start is right now.
1570025070214451200 2022-09-14 12:22:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @gregisenberg I'm writing it as we speak.
1570021317755142145 2022-09-14 12:07:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Appreciate the shout out here, Matt!

1569747414537609218 2022-09-13 17:58:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool I see it every single day.  Highly talented people with impostor syndrome...

1569734394763526147 2022-09-13 17:06:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kebiru_Momodu_ A few rungs above on the ladder of knowledge.
1569734354179325952 2022-09-13 17:06:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew True story, man.
1569733445231722496 2022-09-13 17:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone has knowledge that other people will pay for:  The idea that you have to be an "expert" or have a certificate to teach or sell something is a fallacy.  Expertise is linear.   You can make a living helping those 2-3 steps earlier in the journey than you.
1569725944239104005 2022-09-13 16:33:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Congrats on the launch, Sachin!
1569679570047049732 2022-09-13 13:29:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @martinmcfadden_ @dickiebush Yeah, you're probably right.
1569677499566796801 2022-09-13 13:20:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Very similar to how I write my newsletter:  - Here's the problem - Here's why people fail - Here's what I would do differently - Here's some proof that it works well - Here's a summary or recap of the issue  Process.
1569676075860459520 2022-09-13 13:15:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Do you think this starts to change over time as people realize they aren't always getting a "secret" or that nothing potentially interesting is being "revealed"?  Would be curious to get your take, Dickie.
1569675854250229760 2022-09-13 13:14:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 The plan is simple.  Less than 1% of people who read this Tweet will actually do it.  And they'll be the ones who land clients.
1569675672645165059 2022-09-13 13:13:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom And to think I was going to skip carbs today.
1569675444919713792 2022-09-13 13:12:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It's always weird to me that people feel the need to finish a book they don't enjoy.  Start.  If it doesn't intrigue you? Stop.
1569675314615263237 2022-09-13 13:12:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Out of the weeds as fast as possible.   I made this mistake early on as CRO.
1569675232880861184 2022-09-13 13:11:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour It's a great question. I talk to so many solopreneurs who have never surveyed their customers or analyzed their email/DM.  Weird. That's where the gold is at.
1569672733352394752 2022-09-13 13:01:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmeetM For sure.  I'm working with vendors for my house, so upfront pricing is tricky.  But when I ask for pricing it's a lot of hemming and hawing, then telling me why it's "so high" before I even tell them I think it's high (I don't).  So, now I just let them talk themselves down.
1569671748085325824 2022-09-13 12:58:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robhoffman20 That's right, Rob.
1569671708730179584 2022-09-13 12:57:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I get asked about it a lot.  I'll turn that into a newsletter here soon. Thanks, dude.
1569669994744786945 2022-09-13 12:51:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @josuaio You're forgiven.
1569667952852484097 2022-09-13 12:42:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UnderstoryCopy The latter is so true.
1569667903712104449 2022-09-13 12:42:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CopyIcon Definitely. Get a bunch of testimonials and results.  Then? Be confident.
1569667770337398785 2022-09-13 12:42:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexaom6_ Price what you'd feel comfortable paying and then say it confidently.  Test that over several calls. If you lose every deal, it's too high (or something else is off). If you win too often, it's too low.
1569665830069366790 2022-09-13 12:34:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tashinga360 I'm not necessarily talking about earlier/later. When it comes time to say it, just say it confidently.
1569664898111803393 2022-09-13 12:30:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @glenn_leese Same here, Glenn.
1569664810425401344 2022-09-13 12:30:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach The most powerful.
1569664783464423425 2022-09-13 12:30:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l This is asesome, Shushant.
1569664742024937475 2022-09-13 12:30:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Exactly. I don't need a 10-minute explanation.
1569664694658514944 2022-09-13 12:30:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets It's amazing how many people launch into 10-minute diatribes about why they price themselves the way they do...
1569663473977532416 2022-09-13 12:25:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's amazing how many people can't confidently present me their pricing.  Say your price and be quiet.  You'll close a lot more business that way.
1569663288450973696 2022-09-13 12:24:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rickvaz @IndieHackers About 95% margins. So, most of it.
1569663204183220226 2022-09-13 12:24:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Boom! Love to see it, Jason.  Hope you're enjoying the new version.
1569450094940028931 2022-09-12 22:17:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Thank you so much, Katelyn. Right back at you!

1569371053800947715 2022-09-12 17:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Thanks to @IndieHackers for the nice write-up today.  Come learn a little about my $135k/month business:   https://t.co/HJE4nsaZXn
1569343371935621120 2022-09-12 15:13:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KellyAnnMorris I do often.  I also have something really cool planned for the holiday season...

1569342792438087681 2022-09-12 15:10:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina Gonna be a cohort-based coaching program.
1569342656865517568 2022-09-12 15:10:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vegardwikeby Thank you so much, man.  Never makes it any easier to hit publish for me though :)
1569342145865125889 2022-09-12 15:08:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyahmed0 Total permission to let go and move forward any way I chose.
1569337015447191553 2022-09-12 14:47:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Speak to 1 person — not "everyone."  This is how I think about writing each of my newsletter issues.   Perfectly captured.

1569312366726369281 2022-09-12 13:09:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @609media_com Thanks, Megan!
1569307813209378816 2022-09-12 12:51:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Exactly. She's the whole "why" behind my change.
1569306707829919749 2022-09-12 12:47:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stepanhlinka I've found the opposite to be true.  I've found that most people don't have the social capital to pull off high-ticket, so they try and fail.  I'm sure there are exceptions, of course.  I've done over $2M at an ARPU of $130.
1569306499926691840 2022-09-12 12:46:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coreyhearne Thanks, Corey!

1569305337626329089 2022-09-12 12:42:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stepanhlinka Love this addition, Stepan.
1569304254266970113 2022-09-12 12:37:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dat_CharleyGuy Welcome!
1569304216170283010 2022-09-12 12:37:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor__nnamani Thanks for giving it a read, Victor.
1569304174772502529 2022-09-12 12:37:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadifernandes It's good to diversify but it's also nice to understand one platform deeply before you move to another.
1569304073962229760 2022-09-12 12:37:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianFOConnor It's a mix I enjoy but also one that requires me to keep producing.
1569303969893126147 2022-09-12 12:36:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_ukwuaba Yep. It's right there waiting for us.
1569303916680036352 2022-09-12 12:36:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue The more simple you make things, the better off you are. There's always time to complicate things later down the line if need be.
1569303834337460226 2022-09-12 12:36:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 That's a great addition, Abhishek.
1569303787575058432 2022-09-12 12:35:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide I did for a while and now I can't stop :)
1569301880576118784 2022-09-12 12:28:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sscustomdigital Welcome.
1569301842940817409 2022-09-12 12:28:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nerita_ll Thanks, Nerita!
1569301169306058753 2022-09-12 12:25:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1569301167053705216 2022-09-12 12:25:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 15/ Remember  In the end, I remembered that life is short.  Too many days in front of the computer means too few days with my beautiful wife.  The computer, business, revenue, and social media will always be there.  Our precious time with loved ones will not.  Remember that.
1569301165124247554 2022-09-12 12:25:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 14/ Seek  To better broaden my worldview, I also sought out those who think differently about the world than I do.  - Different politics - Different cultures - Different viewpoints  It was enriching &amp; allowed me to empathize with people I normally wouldn't.  Conversation &gt; news
1569301163052355584 2022-09-12 12:25:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 13/ Relax  Back in 2020, I felt frustrated by social media.  I was succeeding in building my network and businesses, but politics &amp; the world were upsetting.  So, in 2021, I turned it all off.   Eliminated Twitter trends. Blocked news sites.  Talk about relaxing.
1569301161080938497 2022-09-12 12:25:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 12/ Eliminate  In balancing my businesses, I was doing a lot of things I didn't like doing.  So, I just started saying no to things I didn't enjoy.  The easiest way for me to do this was with "No" templates.  Shout out to @thepatwalls for his "How to Say No" series.  Lifesaver.
1569301159248101376 2022-09-12 12:25:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 11/ Diversify  Until late 2021, I was on one social platform: LinkedIn  I had grown to 275k+ followers but had always felt a bit timid on Twitter.  10 months ago, I decided to just go for it.  The result? 185k followers interested in my journey.  Diversify where you create.
1569301157276696576 2022-09-12 12:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ Listen  My business really started taking off when I remembered that my customers tell me what to create next.  Instead of building what I wanted, I asked more questions and listened intently to the answers.  The result?   A $600k+ improvement in product sales.
1569301155125018624 2022-09-12 12:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/ Ask  You don't get what you don't ask for.   That doesn't mean ask willy-nilly. It means being smart with my asks.  This year, I've talked to people I never would have imagined.  Interviewed amazing guests.  Was featured on sites I felt were out of my reach.  Ask!
1569301153380179972 2022-09-12 12:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Give  Over the last few years, I didn't give much back in terms of time or money.   I was overwhelmed.  Candidly, it made me feel a lack of purpose.  This year, I've spent a lot of time giving away my time, donating to causes I support, &amp; spreading love anonymously.
1569301151299895299 2022-09-12 12:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Collaborate  2022 has been all about collaboration for me.  I've met about 10-15 people here on Twitter that I regularly speak to for advice.  Just jamming out, building in public, releasing products, and supporting one another.  More focus on relationships in 2023.
1569301144400265217 2022-09-12 12:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Ignore  With over 460k social media followers across 2 channels, you get a lot of nasty comments.  People are mean. Angry. Condescending. Cruel. Shitty.  I got really aggressive with the block button this year.  My content, my mental health, my rules.
1569301142445645826 2022-09-12 12:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Rest  In 2019, I burned out at my executive job.  In early-2022, I was running the risk of doing the same as a creator.  My solution?  - 6-mile daily walks - 30-minute built-in breaks - One day per week off  In 2023, I'll move to a 3-day workweek.
1569301140403113985 2022-09-12 12:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Focus  I've spent time as a SaaS advisor, coach, mentor, investor, and digital product creator.  2021 was the first year I really spent the majority of my time focused on products.  2020 products: 19% of income 2021 products: 52% of revenue 2022 products: 73% of revenue
1569301138503077888 2022-09-12 12:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Repurpose  My business runs on content.  And after writing unique pieces every day for over 3 years, I finally started to repurpose  It made me nervous.  The outcome?  Nobody noticed and the pieces were widely read by people who had never seen them the first time around.
1569301136540160001 2022-09-12 12:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Reduce  My 5 revenue streams run on so many pieces of technology.  Bills add up, things break, and opportunities are missed.  I cut a bunch of technology and folded all of my businesses into a new site.  All-in-one tech makes things so much more manageable.
1569301130215149569 2022-09-12 12:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Plan  When you're running 100 mph, things get chaotic.  Over the last year, I started breaking my revenue goals down to the day.

1569152618169090049 2022-09-12 02:35:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram Help. The. Customer.
1569084051436310528 2022-09-11 22:02:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HumbleFlow @DBarnettMoncton @DeanOwenTaxes @WrongsToWrite @PerfectGuide_ @UpSkillYourLife @Ant_Philosophy @liftyourmind Thank you 🙏🏻
1569066134057410562 2022-09-11 20:51:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere Funny enough, I didn't use a publishing tool on this.
1569065294009696259 2022-09-11 20:48:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyBarsee That's a huge part of it.
1569065256353251328 2022-09-11 20:48:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @waleagboola_ Of course.
1569065219179126785 2022-09-11 20:47:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsmatt_g Exactly. Focus on $1 and you'll make $1,000.
1569065167471902721 2022-09-11 20:47:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsadityabansal That's 100% true.
1569065136064811008 2022-09-11 20:47:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyOnuoha Lots of people are consistent and fail. It's about having a decent strategy.
1569063753211170818 2022-09-11 20:42:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The reason that making $1 matters is that it changes your mindset.  Here's the entire blueprint to follow.  Start this evening or start tomorrow. Just start.   https://t.co/2MgaN9ft9X
1569063752149917698 2022-09-11 20:42:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4. Use easy tech  Tech doesn't matter in the beginning.   Use what's cheap and easy, or what you already know how to use.  Stop looking for the "perfect stack". It doesn't exist.
1569063751067877384 2022-09-11 20:42:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. Build an email list  Start a newsletter or build a free guide.  Offer it up and ask people to subscribe.  Deplatform your most interested users to a list that you control.
1569063749885087745 2022-09-11 20:42:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. Grow a small audience  Once you've talked to people, next up is sharing info they care about.  Tweet daily about what you learn.  Show them you care about solving the problems you learned about.
1569063748836499457 2022-09-11 20:42:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Talk to people  You can't make a dollar without understanding people's problems.  Too many people skip this step.  Go talk to your prospective customers.
1569063747842342912 2022-09-11 20:42:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to make $1 on the internet:
1568984479993036800 2022-09-11 15:27:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Poolsuite is awesome :)
1568974867235487752 2022-09-11 14:48:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I'm adding to mine each month...
1568966029652418560 2022-09-11 14:13:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis I like that approach, Teddy.
1568964996633137153 2022-09-11 14:09:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 If you're doing the 2nd list daily, do you think the first list can be indicators that things are moving in the right direction?
1568964861769535490 2022-09-11 14:09:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak The education system needs a complete overhaul.  The results speak for themselves. And they're not good.
1568964730898751489 2022-09-11 14:08:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The most successful people find that one authentic thing and amplify it.  The rest just mimic other people. That's why 90% of stuff looks and sounds the same.
1568964460764712961 2022-09-11 14:07:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Moist productivity tools are simply packaged up distraction.
1568964161723400194 2022-09-11 14:06:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Congrats man!
1568964131616587776 2022-09-11 14:06:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Sell me a transformation.
1568962114894577665 2022-09-11 13:58:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ppcClickShark I find that people often end up doing a lot of things they don't enjoy under the guise of "high priority".   Most people aren't very good at knowing what to prioritize in the first place.
1568961712262365186 2022-09-11 13:56:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aka_akadonblack I think this is viewed through the lens of "productivity".  I just don't like the idea that we're supposed to maximize productivity rather than spend a few hours doing things we truly enjoy.
1568959021121474563 2022-09-11 13:45:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @traincoachlaugh Ha. I'll take that, Scott.
1568958979719704577 2022-09-11 13:45:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FrankElda1 Get to a point where you don't need productivity apps.
1568957489776820225 2022-09-11 13:39:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewmcbarnett I agree, Andrew.
1568957437033549825 2022-09-11 13:39:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dan72ros I love Judaism. Great up in a Jewish neighborhood and always found it fascinating.
1568955999112859651 2022-09-11 13:33:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lewis_hatchett Sounds great. It's tougher to do those things when you aren't present.  The best way to be present? Eliminate a lot of things you shouldn't be doing.
1568955865889214471 2022-09-11 13:33:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @highlandbreath Very smart. Lots of interesting ways people do this.
1568955636179664897 2022-09-11 13:32:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Exactly, man.
1568955620644237312 2022-09-11 13:32:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav Not familiar. I'll take a look at it. Thanks!
1568955567724445696 2022-09-11 13:32:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tspeeg Exactly.  Too many shiny things.
1568955534505558017 2022-09-11 13:32:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza For sure. Once you realize it, then it's time to take action.
1568955491296112642 2022-09-11 13:31:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thethinkingbat That's true.  It's takes being cognizant.
1568955434274533376 2022-09-11 13:31:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UncleBimBim Same here, man.
1568955406621487109 2022-09-11 13:31:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadifernandes It's a good exercise.
1568955377630191618 2022-09-11 13:31:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writing_cheats @george__mack For sure.   But don't forget to stop doing things you hate.
1568955323926417408 2022-09-11 13:31:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabe_llewellyn 100%. The more you say no, the bigger your Yes power gets.
1568955261318053888 2022-09-11 13:30:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Web3Mitchy They can for sure.
1568955221610479618 2022-09-11 13:30:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @johncdrilling Thanks, John!
1568955186831413248 2022-09-11 13:30:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YannBrds It sure is, Yann.
1568954053572415488 2022-09-11 13:26:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Too many people have to-do lists.  Not enough people have don't-do lists.
1568753128341635073 2022-09-11 00:07:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rawbinz It's shocking how many people have asked me instead of just Googling:  "What is ICP in the context of business?"   https://t.co/W8agPtt4Ab
1568630974476390402 2022-09-10 16:02:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gillianography I think you'd be crazy not to.  But, I'm very biased.
1568630068703895552 2022-09-10 15:58:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Understanding your talent  2. Knowing the value of your knowledge  3. Putting your peer's knowledge into perspective  4. Learning to ponder your accomplishments  5. The Snowball Effect  Read it here:  https://t.co/WaCrXgyN13
1568630066921218048 2022-09-10 15:58:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My newsletter on Impostor Syndrome has generated more positive responses than any other issue.  48,127 received it 3 hours ago.  Here's what I covered:  ↓  https://t.co/FTUnejkNqx
1568603092769468417 2022-09-10 14:11:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VKhoroshkov There are definitely times when you should quit.
1568602994840838145 2022-09-10 14:11:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewglynch You might be right. The worst case is maximum and not viable.
1568602896081494016 2022-09-10 14:10:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Haha. True story.
1568602834123325443 2022-09-10 14:10:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Ain't this the truth, man.
1568596404041310209 2022-09-10 13:45:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fridayvictorjnr Ideal customer profile
1568596317814890499 2022-09-10 13:44:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iammosesaboh For sure you can.
1568596188303183873 2022-09-10 13:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @singraft14 ICP = ideal customer profile MVP = minimum viable product
1568596132439199746 2022-09-10 13:43:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanarodgers Keep going man!
1568581196795240449 2022-09-10 12:44:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shareef_ZA Me too. I've been both!
1568581021892841472 2022-09-10 12:43:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza Always.
1568580761715965953 2022-09-10 12:42:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How successful solopreneurs operate:  - Has an idea - Talks to their ICP - Builds MVP solution - Drives traffic through content - Validates  Why most solopreneurs fail:  - Has an idea - Researches - Researches - Researches - Gets frustrated by tech - Researches more - Quits
1568573587195297792 2022-09-10 12:14:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Love how you show off the actual process in the GIFs. Very cool, Blake. Need to do that with some of the stuff I'm teaching for sure.
1568365066730233858 2022-09-09 22:25:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thatroblennon This is awesome, Rob. I’m glad my content resonated and was helpful!
1568336170819670016 2022-09-09 20:30:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets You put in the work and it worked.  That's the missing ingredient for a lot of folks.   Keep going, my man.
1568315937467555846 2022-09-09 19:10:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RoryTanner @mattragland @AliAbdaal Thanks for the awesome shout out! I had beers with Matt a few days ago.
1568315306648694784 2022-09-09 19:08:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChristineCarril @stevenshills20 Thank you!
1568226800068710400 2022-09-09 13:16:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak That's right.  Take a number of small risks rather than be catastrophically foolish.
1568226623895310336 2022-09-09 13:15:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina How do you click on things without a proper stretch?
1568223263234334720 2022-09-09 13:02:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mrdhavals It may be contrarian but I'm 100% in agreement with you.
1568222972426452992 2022-09-09 13:01:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 It's weird how the more you put out there, the better chance you have at making a hit.
1568222820441751552 2022-09-09 13:00:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe And you can't be afraid to repel people that are in complete non-alignment.  Playing in the middle gets you nowhere.
1568222659045105666 2022-09-09 12:59:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Objective = Have fun Key Results = Laughter on Zoom
1568222510843596802 2022-09-09 12:59:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Just preparing them for the normal office job.
1568222381835186178 2022-09-09 12:58:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour This is awesome. I love it, Katelyn.
1568221537555070976 2022-09-09 12:55:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wealthluxx Probably not, no.
1568216624523509760 2022-09-09 12:35:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @weisesabio Thanks, Mark!
1568216595071107074 2022-09-09 12:35:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Nearly everyone successful does.  Overcoming it allows you to harness it's power.
1568216395825184771 2022-09-09 12:34:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It's the same view I have.  Mediocre performers almost never have impostor syndrome. In fact, they tend to believe they are better than the facts show.  It's high performers that can be crippled if they don't understand what you just said.
1568216246105120769 2022-09-09 12:34:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmZachHackett It's true.
1568216203105116161 2022-09-09 12:34:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jousefm2 @SahilBloom I agree. But it's tough to reach that conclusion.
1568216135396368386 2022-09-09 12:33:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmZachHackett @SahilBloom It certainly can be. But nearly everyone who has impostor syndrome has it because they are achieving something they don't believe possible.  That's better than being an underperformer!
1568215450856595458 2022-09-09 12:31:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UncleBimBim It's never fully gone, but can certainly be controlled. Glad to hear you're kicking it's butt.
1568215334938710016 2022-09-09 12:30:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadifernandes Looking fwd to sharing it, Aadi.
1568215190289743872 2022-09-09 12:30:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mat_pln Always, Mat.
1568214810713817089 2022-09-09 12:28:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tomorrow, I'm going to talk about my journey with Impostor Syndrome.  It's going out in my weekly newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.  So, if you've ever struggled with it, or feel like an impostor, come give it a read.  Join 48,127 subscribers here:  https://t.co/X3l2wg6fme
1568214807635165184 2022-09-09 12:28:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4. You stop thinking that everyone knows more than you do  As you progress in your journey towards overcoming this, you'll meet people you hold in high regard.  And guess what?  They don't know everything either.  We're all just figuring it out.
1568214805164720129 2022-09-09 12:28:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. You no longer feel blind to the value of your knowledge  You start having honest conversations with your peers.  And by doing so, you realize that your knowledge is powerful and valuable.  Not value-less.   You'll understand that what you know, everyone else doesn't.
1568214802509742087 2022-09-09 12:28:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. You stop rearranging facts in your mind  By analyzing your past you realize there has been some mental rearrangement of facts.  Getting those facts on paper helps you realize you're lying to yourself.  Taming those lies helps the healing process.
1568214800030924805 2022-09-09 12:28:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. You no longer think you're less talented  By looking objectively at your accomplishments, you eliminate the fallacy of "this is all luck".  You start to realize you're likely more talented than you think.  Not less.
1568214792627961857 2022-09-09 12:28:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 things that happen when you beat Impostor Syndrome:
1568198749574266880 2022-09-09 11:24:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 @jayclouse @OhioState Of course. I love the B10.
1568050670351130626 2022-09-09 01:36:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo This is a phenomenal article. You can tell the person writing it actually enjoys it.   Thanks for the share.
1568041688815247364 2022-09-09 01:00:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adammarx13 @jayclouse @OhioState I love it too.  https://t.co/4R22iHy1VU
1568040232129273865 2022-09-09 00:54:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse @OhioState I’d love to talk to the students. Haven’t been back to Columbus in a long time and want to get reconnected and give back.   If you’re comfortable, feel free to intro me. Many thanks 🙏
1568037045611761667 2022-09-09 00:42:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse @OhioState How have I never done this?  Don’t they want to talk to a graduate who started off his collegiate career with a 1.9 GPA?
1567970912095604738 2022-09-08 20:19:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegenuinejulie @bewritethere We're all saying the same things thousands of different ways :)
1567950939298107393 2022-09-08 19:00:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegenuinejulie I wrote this article in February of 2022 before you ever joined Twitter.  How's that?
1567948828921274368 2022-09-08 18:51:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I appreciate that, man.   It’s just something I enjoy, tbh.
1567921509229813761 2022-09-08 17:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Monetization is the outcome of these 3 parts.  I break down the "Creator Funnel" in much greater detail here:   https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE
1567921507430432768 2022-09-08 17:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. Deepening relationships  True relationships are about access.   A "behind-the-scenes" glimpse at how someone thinks, acts, works, etc.  It's much easier to build relationships once they fully trust your expertise and knowledge.  This is why Community is so important.
1567921503613624325 2022-09-08 17:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Getting Discovered  Learning to stand out online is part of modern marketing.  The easiest way to get discovered is to create value where people are already consuming.  - Twitter - LinkedIn - TikTok - YouTube  Etc.
1567921501646602240 2022-09-08 17:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every creator needs a "Creator Funnel".  A simple journey your audience goes through, increasing the chance they become a customer at each step.  It has 3 parts:  ↓
1567867206582534144 2022-09-08 13:27:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This is one of the best processes for building a very high-affinity audience.
1567867087971930112 2022-09-08 13:26:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 It's hard to call yourself a writer if you never hit publish.
1567866876851527682 2022-09-08 13:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe I think one reason is that we're consistently bombarded with the idea that having money is bad. Evil. For the worst people.  It isn't.  Money is an amplifier of who you are as a person.  That's why more good people should get some.
1567866491835453440 2022-09-08 13:24:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Congrats on the monster launch, man!  Just dropped you an upvote.
1567866406326222851 2022-09-08 13:24:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Nail those 2 things and hire a bunch of smart people to take care of the rest...
1567866332665856002 2022-09-08 13:23:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Consistency is a combination of ever-improving discipline and systems for when that discipline ultimately fails (and it will)
1567860429719756800 2022-09-08 13:00:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndrewPierno Best case is never going back to corporate.
1567858262506192898 2022-09-08 12:51:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheGeomarAbreu It's a lot of fun and puts you in a much better position to succeed in the future.
1567857873119477760 2022-09-08 12:50:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill That's how I feel too, Barrett.
1567857828504764417 2022-09-08 12:50:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaronmmota I think so too. Just take 30 days, some free software, and an idea. See if you can push the ball forward a bit.  Then, just keep going.
1567856777290547201 2022-09-08 12:45:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder It really is.   I miss the employees, but not the control over how I spend my time.
1567855138353647616 2022-09-08 12:39:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup @dickiebush Do you like this?  Considering one for my new place.
1567854926319042562 2022-09-08 12:38:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Start, then learn.
1567854883562299392 2022-09-08 12:38:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Ain't that the truth, Matt.   Play in the arena and win the prizes.
1567854800443768833 2022-09-08 12:38:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coacharausch Hell yeah, Andrew.
1567854761428279298 2022-09-08 12:37:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UnderstoryCopy Absolutely.  The cringe-worthy moments are how you know you're learning.
1567853167559204869 2022-09-08 12:31:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michailkarpov 1. Build an audience around a specific topic 2. Build trust using longer-form content 3. Build systems to stay consistent
1567852684455067652 2022-09-08 12:29:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Haha. Exactly.
1567852629220380676 2022-09-08 12:29:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkhundmiri I love that, Mustafa. Do it because you want to, not have to. Completely different outlook.
1567852364509372418 2022-09-08 12:28:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee I love that, Sohaib!
1567852307882151937 2022-09-08 12:28:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pajamahustle They really are.
1567852269575471104 2022-09-08 12:28:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Anshul_Nanda1 100% , Anshul.
1567852238516666370 2022-09-08 12:27:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YounglingAndCo Yep. Own the process.
1567852211664723981 2022-09-08 12:27:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GideonGreat_M Thanks, man.
1567852195537715201 2022-09-08 12:27:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Truth.
1567851570431156225 2022-09-08 12:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've worked as an executive at companies that have raised $300M+ and generated $400M+ in revenue.  But I've never learned more than I'm learning now, screwing around building my own thing on the internet.  Start a side project.  You won't be sorry.
1567844237013549058 2022-09-08 11:56:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Very cool man. Didn't know this...

1567625201902313472 2022-09-07 21:25:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @slowat @Rameshoflondon Or just release that each month has 4.333 weeks 😀
1567602065383333890 2022-09-07 19:53:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina This is the exact playbook I ran to scale my last business. I love it.   Literally, anyone can do this.
1567572668655837188 2022-09-07 17:57:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl I'll sleep when I'm dead, bro! 🥴
1567571898191548420 2022-09-07 17:53:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Invest in building a network and then watch them invest in you. Killer strategy.
1567571782021906432 2022-09-07 17:53:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao You see this a lot when building sales orgs like I did in my previous life.  You give someone a tactic to do something better in the sales call.  They try it once and it "doesn't work".  It's not meant to work 100% of the time. It's mean to improve likelihoods.
1567571396141744129 2022-09-07 17:51:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki You're the GOAT at this, man.
1567561043769020417 2022-09-07 17:10:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Liviglarge Daniel Vassallo comes to mind right away.  No fancy website, mostly just uses Content + Gumroad.
1567560817003954182 2022-09-07 17:09:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foundersuccess For sure.
1567560796728709123 2022-09-07 17:09:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlanJLSmith Haha. Nailed it, Alan.
1567560761395781637 2022-09-07 17:09:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BradleyYoungjr Same. I've gotten to landing pages before and I'm like, "How do I buy this?"
1567560699315888130 2022-09-07 17:09:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyOmarr Try a few things and see what sticks. But you have to have some direction based on a strong opinion you have about something.
1567560589169270798 2022-09-07 17:09:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Sure does, Sohaib.
1567560563072417792 2022-09-07 17:08:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Complicate down the road if need be!
1567560531652890626 2022-09-07 17:08:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv 100, Dhruv.
1567560502322118661 2022-09-07 17:08:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimonHoiberg That sounds perfect :)
1567560448538546177 2022-09-07 17:08:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg That can all come later, if necessary.
1567559129719267329 2022-09-07 17:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I know people doing $10k/month with nothing more than:  - Content attention - A very strong landing page - A well-priced product or service - A simple way to accept payments  That’s literally it.  As always, resist the urge to overcomplicate.  Start simple.
1567542809216913410 2022-09-07 15:58:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Nice stuff here, Matt. Been using BlackMagic the same way for 3+ months now.  Gamechanger.
1567499546258808833 2022-09-07 13:06:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Thank you, sir.
1567499248769302530 2022-09-07 13:05:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robinsmorenburg  https://t.co/MacNbGJgcv
1567499010998472705 2022-09-07 13:04:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe It will also help you stick to your purpose and find the 20% of action that moves the needle.
1567498884707979269 2022-09-07 13:03:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Share openly and freely.   When it comes time to earn money, people will pay for aggregation, speed, and accountability.
1567498755607351298 2022-09-07 13:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Once you've written them down, how do you think about tackling them?
1567498558055538688 2022-09-07 13:02:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour And the definition of a scam artist is taking the simple and making it complex.
1567493134598250500 2022-09-07 12:41:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shwnhll 3.5 years of posting each morning at the exact same time and actually interacting with my audience :)
1567492985754984448 2022-09-07 12:40:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @avi_schneier Sure, you'll love a lot of the process. But the boring stuff will be there. And if it's part of the 20% that moves the needle, it's best that it gets done...
1567492082314485761 2022-09-07 12:36:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Right? This hack is crazy!
1567491256489574402 2022-09-07 12:33:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sultanofcopy Not quite yet. On my way though!
1567491177124880387 2022-09-07 12:33:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mgppap Success isn't a destination. It's many moments over your life.
1567490231749713924 2022-09-07 12:29:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nailingthreads Most people don't want to do the boring stuff or they are focused on the wrong boring stuff.
1567490166838657024 2022-09-07 12:29:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tspeeg That's the key ingredient.
1567488794261180417 2022-09-07 12:23:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertoblake Super facts. It's finding the 20% that's the difficult part.
1567488498608775170 2022-09-07 12:22:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pelaseyed Zero, Ismail.
1567488479604477952 2022-09-07 12:22:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KalenHouck True story. I see this with my own eyes every day.
1567488406984204288 2022-09-07 12:22:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simohosio Yep. Focus matters.
1567488361585156097 2022-09-07 12:22:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza The most monotonous thing but the right monotonous thing.
1567488271655092227 2022-09-07 12:21:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gideon_shawana You're welcome. Thanks for stopping by to read.
1567488206521733127 2022-09-07 12:21:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav Yep. That's basically it here.
1567488174032654336 2022-09-07 12:21:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv And focused.
1567487530559307776 2022-09-07 12:18:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Success is just boring consistency applied to the 20% of stuff that actually matters.
1567480050210979842 2022-09-07 11:49:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheeChrisPeters Calendly has a free plan that works and you can use Google Meets or any other free video solution. Doesn't have to be a paid Zoom license.

1567306962135556096 2022-09-07 00:21:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Love the working smart part. The more attention you gain, the more leverage you have.  The more leverage you have, the more you can accumulate wealth in a shorter period of time.
1567251222075170818 2022-09-06 20:39:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ Get after it!
1567247072734199808 2022-09-06 20:23:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_waseembaloch_ Smart move.
1567246914021740544 2022-09-06 20:22:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MalkanKaya @SahilBloom Exactly. Bookmarking it doesn't make it happen.

1567209689934331911 2022-09-06 17:54:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona That's awesome, man!
1567209672561631232 2022-09-06 17:54:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Ain't it though?
1567209593549234180 2022-09-06 17:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Thank you, man.  Trying new stuff to see what sticks.
1567205708025794563 2022-09-06 17:38:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HireFireTeam Not quite that literally, no.   But when people reach out, take it to DM, do some discovery and then let them know you think you could help them solve the problem.   Then share how they can sign up for a session.
1567204368650321920 2022-09-06 17:33:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide I love Gumroad.  I like being able to customize my site through Carrd. Just more flexibility in my mind.
1567204154501746688 2022-09-06 17:32:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue Yep. Most people never validate or get it wrong.
1567204044447404035 2022-09-06 17:32:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Thank you, brother. Appreciate it.
1567203984754020353 2022-09-06 17:32:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond Here it is :)
1567203957180710917 2022-09-06 17:31:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao Exactly. Lots of nuances. But get started.
1567203825164902401 2022-09-06 17:31:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @didioke_ @joserosado Thank you.
1567201853049372673 2022-09-06 17:23:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_robwilloughby Thanks, Rob.
1567201551302762501 2022-09-06 17:22:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writes_eve @SahilBloom Keep going, Eve!
1567201507644243970 2022-09-06 17:22:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hustlenconquer Go for it. I stole it.
1567200700035203072 2022-09-06 17:18:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge The bare minimum. I scaled this to $40k per month.
1567200526516748289 2022-09-06 17:18:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @leoarun @SahilBloom I don't know of a list, but you can create a side hustle with any knowledge or skill
1567200416034693122 2022-09-06 17:17:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado Thanks, Jose. Glad it sparked a little thought.
1567200297210023937 2022-09-06 17:17:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_heydave Thanks, Dave!
1567200256776880128 2022-09-06 17:17:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Hell yes! :)
1567199246826315779 2022-09-06 17:13:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @babushka99 Thanks!
1567199181885906950 2022-09-06 17:12:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cantbemikerich @BryantFerate It takes more than 30 days. That's the kicker.
1567199125854109709 2022-09-06 17:12:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_heydave Thanks, Dave. Most of this stuff needs to be explained more simplistically.
1567199064478842882 2022-09-06 17:12:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 I love it. Keep it going!
1567199024234614785 2022-09-06 17:12:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Appreciate you, brother.

1567147108939046913 2022-09-06 13:46:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 Appreciate you!
1567146974536769538 2022-09-06 13:45:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup I'm 25% of the way through it and it's really hit me hard.  Very purpose driven.   Props to @TMitrosilis for the gift.
1567146666494496771 2022-09-06 13:44:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 Thanks for the inclusion with these great folks, Abhishek!
1567141668431749120 2022-09-06 13:24:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush 4. If I don't like it, can I easily walk away without a hit to my reputation and financial situation?
1567141154977718273 2022-09-06 13:22:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak This is fantastic, man. Thanks for sharing!
1567141067039948801 2022-09-06 13:22:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Finishing strategic projects is one of the most euphoric feelings out there.
1567140943136014339 2022-09-06 13:21:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Congratulations, Andrew!
1567140881504796675 2022-09-06 13:21:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup That's basically a good life right there.   Have you read "The Second Mountain" by David Brooks?
1567140721970348034 2022-09-06 13:20:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis A fixed mindset is focused on what others are doing.  A growth mindset is focused on what you're doing.
1567139597313884163 2022-09-06 13:16:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CuriousDan3 I think you're more in agreement with me than you might be aware of.
1567138335725961216 2022-09-06 13:11:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Put in the work, reap the luck and the rewards.
1567137965339557890 2022-09-06 13:09:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CuriousDan3 No, I wouldn't say so.   Do you think that's a good example or an outlier?
1567135944209305601 2022-09-06 13:01:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulElijas I generally agree with that. Looking fwd to watching this.
1567135751560626176 2022-09-06 13:00:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sairahul1 It definitely can. You need to be in a position to get lucky though. And that often (not always) requires hard work.
1567133226904190976 2022-09-06 12:50:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @staneika Of course, those can happen.   But, picking outliers generally isn't the best way to determine whether or not something is more or less likely to happen.
1567132799345299457 2022-09-06 12:49:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pveugen They are absolutely intertwined. I don't disagree with that.
1567130566352420866 2022-09-06 12:40:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Nailing it, Sohaib,
1567130538489663492 2022-09-06 12:40:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewglynch I love that quote, Andrew. Thanks for sharing it, man.
1567128129323372546 2022-09-06 12:30:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BackpackerFI Wow, I love that, Danny!
1567128047542738947 2022-09-06 12:30:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_robwilloughby True story, Rob.
1567128011018731521 2022-09-06 12:30:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza ALmost always, Antonio!

1567127924523900928 2022-09-06 12:29:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv I like that, Dhruv!
1567127888876429312 2022-09-06 12:29:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew That's 100% true, IMO, as well, Jarek.
1567127823072071680 2022-09-06 12:29:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby One of my faves too.  Hope the NY apartment search gets better, man!
1567126756393422849 2022-09-06 12:25:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What most people call "luck" is usually just unnoticed hard work.
1566848045626580992 2022-09-05 17:57:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HargroveAlex Cheers! 🍻
1566843080896139265 2022-09-05 17:37:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HargroveAlex I didn't say everyone should sell every piece of advice.  I just think people should be cognizant of the fact that their knowledge has value.
1566837720399454211 2022-09-05 17:16:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Yes sir.
1566836684133699584 2022-09-05 17:12:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsmarcosruiz That's gotta happen first.
1566836658548445184 2022-09-05 17:12:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Knowledge blindness.
1566835677408411650 2022-09-05 17:08:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FahimAnvar Good or bad?
1566835647213617155 2022-09-05 17:08:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoeyGMendoza That's exactly it, Joey.
1566834335382118400 2022-09-05 17:03:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every time you email a friend with a helpful tip for their business, you are sharing knowledge someone else on Twitter would pay for.
1566773874766880768 2022-09-05 13:02:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks Congrats, brother! :)
1566771804588367872 2022-09-05 12:54:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder That's the ticket right there, my man.
1566770901005262850 2022-09-05 12:51:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Success is just boring consistency applied to the same important things.
1566770758801674246 2022-09-05 12:50:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Or they pull you down because deep in their hearts they think it should have been them.  They are projecting the anger they feel at themselves onto you. Classic.
1566766331944394753 2022-09-05 12:32:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bryhutch That's awesome to hear, Bryan!
1566766272863404034 2022-09-05 12:32:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue I love that, Sean. Definitely part of the reason I'm here.
1566765744343449600 2022-09-05 12:30:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jasielinvests Keep going!
1566765564047106050 2022-09-05 12:29:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mjovanovictech It will, Milan!
1566765537757220868 2022-09-05 12:29:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen This is the best comment right here. Nailed it, Dennis.
1566765465552257024 2022-09-05 12:29:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LilianPertenava Stress is not a bad thing.  Burnout is, but stress is required to move forward in life.
1566765151788961792 2022-09-05 12:28:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Literally, never.
1566765106033213441 2022-09-05 12:28:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dev_hoss Thanks, Hossam.
1566765086470971392 2022-09-05 12:28:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NunoG_Rodrigues Don't chase money.  Chase solving problems. Money will come.
1566764399410511873 2022-09-05 12:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Jobs that destroy your mental health are never worth it.  Even with huge pay, it never works.  Instead:  1. Find a great job 2. Focus on your health 3. Spend time working on "obsession" projects 4. Turn them into a full-time business over time  Hard to do when burning out.
1566576558948638720 2022-09-04 23:58:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Text me.   I got you.
1566498344377241600 2022-09-04 18:48:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @maximehugodupre This is SO cool.  Gonna start using this to test mine. Thanks for sharing, Mike.
1566445855594487810 2022-09-04 15:19:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ The "never sleeps part" is so true. That's why it's important to leverage a team to constantly be churning out valuable content for your users.   Good stuff, Matt.
1566424420075331587 2022-09-04 13:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Too many zero-sum mindsets.
1566412096421744641 2022-09-04 13:05:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Great thread.  A lifesaver for me has been "no templates".  I have a template that my VA uses to politely decline a number of different asks that are on my avoid-at-all-costs list.
1566409730179866626 2022-09-04 12:55:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt For sure. Get that time back.
1566409678547992576 2022-09-04 12:55:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Richard_andey Nailed it, Andrew.
1566409644729417728 2022-09-04 12:55:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Love these additions, Kieran. Thanks for taking the time to add them!
1566407251379867648 2022-09-04 12:46:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneSahilB I should have included that. Great lesson, Sahil.
1566407188104503296 2022-09-04 12:45:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Promise_cee Smart move, Promise.
1566407160132763650 2022-09-04 12:45:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aasthaxgautam Thanks for reading!
1566407130806099968 2022-09-04 12:45:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee For sure, Sohaib. Focus on that 20%.
1566406357787545601 2022-09-04 12:42:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Advice I wish I had 2 years ago:  • Focus on the 20% that matters • Generating online attention is critical • Outsource/automate administrative tasks • Operate a portfolio of small bets, not huge risks • Block and ignore anyone who doesn't deserve you  Hope that helps.
1566396568047075334 2022-09-04 12:03:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessicajychan @AliAbdaal @thedankoe @simonsinek @JamesClear @dickiebush Thanks, Jessica!

1566058619480702976 2022-09-03 13:40:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Richard_andey Definitely.  Build that system, but also infuse it with a personal touch.
1566056953637486592 2022-09-03 13:34:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @contentmaniac_ Thanks, Munawwarah!
1566056833722236935 2022-09-03 13:33:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Caring about people is a winning strategy.
1566056361733111812 2022-09-03 13:31:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisPotter361 Oh, 100%. I love this, Chris.
1566056311263043585 2022-09-03 13:31:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @toluwaniadewole Great question!
1566056281282068484 2022-09-03 13:31:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder Thanks, brother. Right back at ya, man.
1566055787193040896 2022-09-03 13:29:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nailingthreads For sure. But I like good old fashioned customer service.
1566055329070256136 2022-09-03 13:27:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you run a one-person business, your goal should be to surprise and delight your customer.  - Prompt response time - Cheerful email etiquette - 10x value products &amp; services - No questions asked refund policy  It's not hard.  Treat your customers the way you want to be treated.
1566049136150986753 2022-09-03 13:03:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge These are epic. I love sh*t like this, Blake. Thank you!
1566048506594353153 2022-09-03 13:00:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Wait until you're 41 😂   The next 9 years are wild.

1565325499517345793 2022-09-01 13:07:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thecookiedosai That's exactly it, Abha.
1565325468395520001 2022-09-01 13:07:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere True, Pranshu.
1565325451446427651 2022-09-01 13:07:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justincsimon Sometimes you just gotta outlast people.
1565324580457152517 2022-09-01 13:03:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Exactly how to tell, Dhruv.
1565324294598582274 2022-09-01 13:02:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyjoeyjustice  https://t.co/1N6y7njato
1565323846328221697 2022-09-01 13:01:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurs don't need viral content.  Marketing yourself is about getting on base every day.  - Familiar name - Familiar face - Familiar topic - Familiar content  It's cliché as hell but play Moneyball.
1565322836138463233 2022-09-01 12:57:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit They continuously refer to money as "evil" and tear down anyone attempting to make more of it.
1565320054702497794 2022-09-01 12:45:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW It's a great strategy, man.
1565319565428637697 2022-09-01 12:44:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ Motivation and inspiration are huge.
1565319477172080643 2022-09-01 12:43:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Same here. That's my fave.
1565319312335933441 2022-09-01 12:43:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom True story.
1565316047506374657 2022-09-01 12:30:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii I mix and match
1565315233996066817 2022-09-01 12:26:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Love @GrowthDotDesign
1565314842902368256 2022-09-01 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I break down these 4 examples in a recent newsletter issue:  - Why it matters - How to effectively do it - Who on Twitter does it really well  And more.  Read it here:  https://t.co/laDk9hPtqM
1565314841061072896 2022-09-01 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4. This person understands me  Last is content that is high on empathy.  Content that reaches your audience &amp; says, "I understand what you're going through" or, "you're not alone in that experience".  This content greatly humanizes an otherwise inanimate social media profile.
1565314838796140545 2022-09-01 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. This person makes me think  We all come across content that challenges our preconceived notions.  This can be really powerful.  It should leave your audience with the reaction, "I've never thought of it like that before" or "Woah, what great way to describe that".
1565314836929695745 2022-09-01 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. This person entertains me  If you hammer your audience with facts and teachings 100% of the time, you run the risk of boring them.  Then you get tuned out.   Get people smiling, laughing, and sharing with their friends.  They are likely to see you as someone worth reading.
1565314835071619074 2022-09-01 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. This person wants to help me  If you teach prospective followers and customers how to do something, you'll be seen as a helpful mentor online.  Content like this also shows the reader that you're truly a master of your domain, rather than someone providing high-level fluff.
1565314826548781062 2022-09-01 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone should have a strategy to produce "emotional response" content.  The problem?   Most people forget they're writing for the reader.  Here are 4 emotional responses for excellent content:  ↓
1565134283928473609 2022-09-01 00:27:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf I've have "On Confidence" by @TheSchoolOfLife and it's excellent. I'll have to pick this up.
1565045260904009729 2022-08-31 18:34:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Assume most of what you build will fail, and be surprised when it doesn't.  Then be nimble, and work to expand it.  Then? Try to replicate under the same belief as before.
1565045024340983808 2022-08-31 18:33:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak I'm optimizing for life-life balance ;-)
1565044971551555590 2022-08-31 18:32:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Also - do what you say you're going to do.  Literally, nobody does.
1565044851586093056 2022-08-31 18:32:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh I really enjoyed Build Once, Sell Twice by @jackbutcher
1565044761697951750 2022-08-31 18:32:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao This is why selling is everything :)
1565044664264261636 2022-08-31 18:31:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Some of the best moments of my life were building Zocdoc and PatientPop. I tell stories about 2009 and 2015 all of the time.   Some of my best friends are from those places.  Have fun. Enjoy the ride.
1565044454158991361 2022-08-31 18:30:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup This is why, when I have a product idea, I don't ask people if they want it or like it.  I ask them to pay for the idea.   Then, I build it if I get enough interest.   Saves me a lot of time.
1565044096170852354 2022-08-31 18:29:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Many customers think they know what they want, but often it's not what they need.  Wrap what they need in a story that makes it feel like what they want.   Then deliver it.
1565043895527931910 2022-08-31 18:28:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Success is not a destination. It's many moments in time over the course of your life.
1565024388319252485 2022-08-31 17:11:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Solid list here, Matt. Hearing great things about Alex.
1565009221074182145 2022-08-31 16:10:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Hell yeah, man!
1565008687441362944 2022-08-31 16:08:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano Wow...this is one of the most robust threads on writing I've come across.  Appreciate the feature as well, Ben!
1565007041860608003 2022-08-31 16:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Online Course Marketing 101:  Your offer should answer, "What, exactly, will customers achieve?"  It's not: "Learn copywriting"  It's: "In 1 hour, you'll learn the process for creating 10 high-quality pieces of written content each day"  Outcome clarity is critical.
1564980584333574145 2022-08-31 14:17:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Next up? Notion
1564957559693377536 2022-08-31 12:45:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Right?
1564957546473033728 2022-08-31 12:45:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoppensTom Had to make sure that was in there or it didn't make sense :)
1564957306432913409 2022-08-31 12:44:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This is excellent, excellent writing advice. Ever since you told me to separate my writing and editing, it's become so much better.
1564957009597931520 2022-08-31 12:43:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JustinWise Oh, goodness. So many.
1564956834775064576 2022-08-31 12:42:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Like most things, great writing is the outcome of a process.
1564956753548255232 2022-08-31 12:42:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe So many people doing Copy/Paste on someone else's business only to find out they don't know how to deliver the results.
1564954794070007814 2022-08-31 12:34:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rrmdp @levelsio I know people who have been waiting 3+ years to ship something they've been building when they could have put it into the hands of new users to trial and provide feedback.
1564954626323103745 2022-08-31 12:33:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RachelThalmann You're onto something here, Rachel!
1564954581167218688 2022-08-31 12:33:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gibson_benstowe I like that :)
1564954105168232448 2022-08-31 12:31:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coacharausch I'm loving your comments, Andrew. Keep 'em up!
1564954023303806983 2022-08-31 12:31:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_earcus I love that.
1564954001627570176 2022-08-31 12:31:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TessaRDavis It's on us to create v1 and works towards "perfection" (not attainable) over time...
1564953903334133761 2022-08-31 12:31:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DavidCrysler Exactly, David.
1564953866013220865 2022-08-31 12:30:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewritethere Exactly. A lot of folks just waiting...
1564953817690537985 2022-08-31 12:30:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robhoffman20 At least get started, Rob!
1564953784685658115 2022-08-31 12:30:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JODonnellCoach Take small, meaningful action with the long game in mind.
1564953732277829635 2022-08-31 12:30:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav I love it :)
1564952463895035904 2022-08-31 12:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Good things don't always come to those who wait.  Good things come to those who take smart action in the short term and remain consistent in the long term.  Waiting and waiting until everything is "perfect" will yield the opposite of good things.  It will likely yield nothing.
1564673315473596418 2022-08-30 17:56:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drarunjayaraj I definitely was 70/30 discipline in the beginning.   Has shifted over time for sure.
1564655222848380931 2022-08-30 16:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is part discipline and part random.  The discipline makes up ~40% of my schedule.  - Healthy goals - Daily action steps - Regular check-in points  The other 60% remains flexible for interesting new opportunities.  Trust me, it's a lot less fun if it's 100% rigid.
1564601103286665216 2022-08-30 13:09:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx Roast me.    https://t.co/sTZwmJ4ydp
1564600034028654595 2022-08-30 13:04:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 This is my entire strategy in one Tweet.
1564599954160721921 2022-08-30 13:04:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Whatever you do, do it excellently. That's how you move levels.
1564599858241146885 2022-08-30 13:04:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge And think about the act as a "small risk" vs. being catastrophically foolish. Move fast, move small and examine.
1564599747540910081 2022-08-30 13:03:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina @MrFourToEight I guess that's how I felt when I hit Decillion per month.
1564599190956785665 2022-08-30 13:01:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour This is a great teaser. Bravo 😃
1564598476834570243 2022-08-30 12:58:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado Well, I must say the copy is extraordinary.   I'll be grabbing it today.   You crushed it.
1564597009943875586 2022-08-30 12:52:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MrFourToEight I understand that.  I think you might be swapping "compared myself to" with "I was inspired by".   I think there's a slight difference there. Just my opinion though.
1564594891363160066 2022-08-30 12:44:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_theakinwale I love that, Akin.
1564594828616376326 2022-08-30 12:44:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado Exactly, Jose.  P.S. Your landing page for your new Instagram course is fire. I read through it and it just knocked my socks off.  I'll be borrowing for upcoming products! 😂
1564594621262569475 2022-08-30 12:43:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Johnson_AsiNG Yep. I agree with that, man.
1564594561216905222 2022-08-30 12:43:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Same, jarek.
1564594522809679878 2022-08-30 12:42:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JustinWise That's my goal :)
1564594486264664064 2022-08-30 12:42:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki It's also a long game with many winners.  It's easy to forget that someone else's success doesn't preclude you from being successful.
1564594286942879745 2022-08-30 12:42:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcuscelestin_ I don't.  I fall victim to it all of the time.  This message is written to myself.
1564591305602334727 2022-08-30 12:30:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Student4everOne I love that, Jagadeesh.
1564591249608380417 2022-08-30 12:29:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlKaufmanADI I've always loved that quote, Karl.
1564591184982466561 2022-08-30 12:29:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew It's a huge trap. But I just remind myself that I'm much further ahead than where I was 2 years ago.   That's what matters.
1564590822330441729 2022-08-30 12:28:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kebiru_Momodu_ That's an awesome way of putting it, Kay.
1564590772787318785 2022-08-30 12:28:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyAmna1 You can follow their strategy, but it's tough to shortcut the journey.
1564590726935203840 2022-08-30 12:27:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JODonnellCoach You can't. You'll set yourself up for failure.
1564590040117829632 2022-08-30 12:25:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship 101:  Comparing yourself to others is the easiest way to get distracted.  You can only control how successful you are, not how successful someone else is.  Be the best version of yourself, not a better version of someone else.
1564578314806861824 2022-08-30 11:38:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The "take your project public" part of this resonates.   If you're doing a lot of interesting things in life but not sharing them, that's fine.   But you're missing big opportunities to inspire, connect, partner, earn, etc.

1564299480295432195 2022-08-29 17:10:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WrittenMastery For sure. I would too if I used CK.
1564299451862323202 2022-08-29 17:10:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JackieMPearce Awesome. Glad they are helpful, Jackie.
1564299413291507714 2022-08-29 17:10:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmAnasAmrani Thanks, Amrani.
1564299392454115329 2022-08-29 17:10:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew Heck yeah, Jarek. Nice.
1564299368852856837 2022-08-29 17:10:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jacob_cardy Thanks, Jacob!
1564297666296791040 2022-08-29 17:03:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I break down these 4 examples (and more) in a recent newsletter issue.  Want to learn how to set these up?  You can read the entire issue for free here:   https://t.co/JElqOQ5D08
1564297663415304194 2022-08-29 17:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4. Leverage the LinkedIn Comment "pin"  You can now pin a comment on any LinkedIn post, which I use to drive newsletter subs and website visits.  Drive 800 visitors just yesterday.  https://t.co/g9GIZGUIp8
1564297654795997189 2022-08-29 17:03:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. Put it in my LinkedIn Profile 2x  LinkedIn now has both a featured section and a profile URL (like Twitter).   This drives thousands of new subs per month.  You're missing out if you don't have this setup.  https://t.co/XRqYj7BizU
1564297641395093504 2022-08-29 17:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. Used Hypefury autoplugs  I generated 604 additional clicks to my newsletter landing page without lifting a finger.  Simple Auto-plugging anytime I had a popular Tweet.  https://t.co/6Z5M7FzWAu
1564297635002998785 2022-08-29 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Used the Revue badge on my Twitter profile  I don't use Revue for my newsletter, but that's ok!  I set up a Zap for Revue → Kajabi so I could add the badge to my profile.  Easy capture via Twitter.  https://t.co/pBssWh8w3a
1564297626312400896 2022-08-29 17:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I added 9,200+ newsletter subscribers this month.  Here are 4 simple things I did:  https://t.co/GPbixoEklF
1564297393771888640 2022-08-29 17:02:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush That subscriber number is flying...congrats, man!
1564291208171737088 2022-08-29 16:37:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 One of your best threads. A really tactical approach to monetizing writing.
1564234153868115969 2022-08-29 12:50:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoseTyoyila Thanks, Jose!
1564234103297576963 2022-08-29 12:50:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge So critical dude. Be everywhere.
1564233772148707328 2022-08-29 12:49:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup 100%. Do something interesting and tell people how you did it.
1564233633673650176 2022-08-29 12:48:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jenny_millions Thanks, Jennifer!
1564231439306178560 2022-08-29 12:40:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Exactly. I know people with 10,000 followers making $100k+ per year and people with 100k followings making $0 (and trying!)
1564230285981540352 2022-08-29 12:35:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kahliltweets Appreciate that, Kahlil.

1564228110924627968 2022-08-29 12:26:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @superzac Awesome!
1564226838637027328 2022-08-29 12:21:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1564226836665606144 2022-08-29 12:21:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you can nail these 4 things, you are absolutely on your way to 1,000 true fans.   TL;DR  1. Think like a niche "streaming service"  2. Become a Category Pirate  3. Tell a story worth following  4. Do unscalable things
1564226834321084418 2022-08-29 12:21:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I cannot overstate how important it is to be everywhere when you're just getting started.   A lot of people refer to this as simply "creating value", but there needs to be a deeper definition of how to do that.  I think @dvassallo captured it best when he stated it like this:  https://t.co/TmWZwZN5uG
1564226827794743296 2022-08-29 12:21:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Published daily to social media, often 2x per day. 2. Replied to every comment, every morning for an hour. 3. Responded to 75%+ of the DMs I received on social media. 4. Engaged w/ 10+ people's content every morning for over a year.  Not scalable but massively valuable!
1564226825404010497 2022-08-29 12:21:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Do Unscalable Things  With a tight niche, unique perspective, &amp; compelling story, you'll make significant progress.  But you can't just put this all on "autopilot".  In the beginning, you're going to need to do a lot of things that don't scale.  Here are some things I did:
1564226823076151297 2022-08-29 12:21:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The story can't be made up or fake.   It should be your real story but stitched together in a fashion that makes it easy (and exciting) to follow along.  There's a formula for doing that.  Feel free to steal my 7-step process to create yours:
1564226820605714435 2022-08-29 12:21:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Tell a Story Worth Following:  I call this building a better backstory.  Much like the founder of a startup company, you need a story that compels your audience to follow you.   They need to literally see themselves in you.
1564226818776993793 2022-08-29 12:21:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> P.S. I wrote more about non-obvious content here:   https://t.co/M9Q9qqFMhW  Let's keep going ↓
1564226816184881152 2022-08-29 12:21:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So, have a unique viewpoint in your niche.  - What is something everyone believes to be true, that you don't? - What is something nobody in your niche is talking about, that they should be? - What are the biggest mistakes people are making, that they are oblivious to?
1564226814041636866 2022-08-29 12:21:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> “Becoming a Category Pirate is 100x easier when you become known for your unique perspective inside of your niche.  You don’t need everyone in the world to care about who you are &amp; what you do.  You just need a small pirate ship of folks who agree with your unique perspective."
1564226811646644226 2022-08-29 12:21:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> And the easiest way to stand out is through non-obvious content.  Non-obvious content is all about bringing a brand new thought process to your niche.  Something that makes you radically different than others.  I talked to @Nicolascole77 , to get his take:
1564226809314639878 2022-08-29 12:21:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Become a Category Pirate:  If you nail a niche, you're likely to have a small group of people who come along with you on your journey.  But, at some point, you must bring a unique perspective to the table if you want to keep growing.  You can't just share the obvious.
1564226807330734080 2022-08-29 12:21:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You can't just "help small businesses".   You're much better off helping "SaaS companies in the finance vertical, below $10M in revenue".  The more helpful your content is to a specific audience, the more likely they are to find your "signal" in a world of generic "noise".
1564226805212536838 2022-08-29 12:21:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Think Like a Niche Streaming Service:  In 2021, big streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu saw their market share drop from 65% to 48%.  Meanwhile, niche streaming services are growing at more than 2x the rate of the major players.  Why?  Because niche content resonates.
1564226803190972419 2022-08-29 12:21:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Building an audience of raving fans is the key to unlocking internet revenue.  But when you start from zero, it's incredibly hard.  Nail these 4 points below, you'll be well on your way.  1. Think niche 2. Become a pirate 3. Tell a story 4. Go unscalable  Let's dive in.
1564226800934330368 2022-08-29 12:21:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to find your first 1,000 true fans on the internet.  A 4-step tactical plan:  🧵

1563522294810804226 2022-08-27 13:42:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour The only thing that is "quicker" is generally learning common mistakes from others before you make them.   But even then, there's something helpful in making (and learning from) them on your own.
1563520114972307457 2022-08-27 13:33:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coreyhearne Sure feels like it Corey.

1562778199817273345 2022-08-25 12:25:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your purpose:  1. Do you truly appreciate time as currency?  2. What is your motivation for time freedom?  3. How have you curated an environment that supports your goal?
1562778196759613441 2022-08-25 12:25:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In Summary  The journey towards designing a life of intention never ends.  Here are the three groups and nine key drivers to always be improving, in the form of simple questions you can ask yourself ↓  https://t.co/tJbRoaGMOo
1562778189557952512 2022-08-25 12:25:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Undisciplined Creator  This is someone with motivation &amp; action but no discipline.  They share freely &amp; shine a spotlight on their work. But the success isn’t immediate.  Then they crumble. The world isn’t fair. Why should I change? I want to keep doing things my way.  https://t.co/CWYiB6xu6a
1562778182532870144 2022-08-25 12:25:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Aimless Producer  This is someone with discipline that takes action, but they lack purpose.  They are heads down on work &amp; in competition with others. Moving full speed ahead.  They never stop to consider purpose, making it an unfulfilling hamster wheel with no end in sight.  https://t.co/DgP8t5wRFr
1562778175423528960 2022-08-25 12:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Passionate Dreamer  This is someone who understands their purpose &amp; has started to put in place discipline.  They talk often about recreating their lives. The challenge? They never start.  They can’t pull the trigger and they never move forward.   It becomes just a dream.  https://t.co/jFL4psT8zw
1562778168196739075 2022-08-25 12:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Problem: Most people get 2 out of 3  When I speak with people who are attempting to design their life with more intention, they generally fall into the “2 out of 3” camp.  These are the 3 combinations that never seem to make it. ↓
1562778165881081858 2022-08-25 12:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Momentum  Momentum in life design is no different than momentum in business.  Creating &amp; seizing opportunity compounds over time, and compound work wins over short-term hacks.   When something works, double down.   When something fails, eliminate or iterate and try again.
1562778162958073858 2022-08-25 12:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Opportunity  Opportunity is one outcome of sharing your ideas.  It attracts other interesting thinkers.   Doing so will help you develop skills.   Use those skills to build assets, and those assets to create income.   With that income, you create more time. The cycle continues.
1562778160206598147 2022-08-25 12:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Creation  The most common form of failure is a failure to start.  Creation is the act of getting started.   We can have motivation, become disciplined, and take accountability for our lives.   But without action, we’re simply dreamers.
1562778156909867013 2022-08-25 12:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Action  Our 3rd bucket is action.  Action moves us from the old life to a new, intentional life.  To create freedom, we must create income.  That comes from owning a corner of the internet.   Action is:   - Creation - Opportunity - Momentum  https://t.co/nW4i7UFNFs
1562778150647369730 2022-08-25 12:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Habits  We have our own internal systems &amp; processes called habits.  If, “how we spend our days is how we spend our lives” is true, then habits are how we spend our days.  Because better habits mean better days, then it’s easy to believe they are a core driver of a better life.
1562778148265070598 2022-08-25 12:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Change  Change means breaking away from the routine &amp; false comfort of the traditional system.  It means doing new &amp; interesting things with new &amp; interesting people.  Only when we extend our comfort zone can we truly grow.  The fishing is often best where the fewest go.
1562778145765617664 2022-08-25 12:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Ownership  Ownership is understanding that you are completely in control of your own life.  Nobody is coming to save you.  Yes, some people have it tougher, while others have it easier. This is factual.  But believing you don't have control fundamentally destroys the concept.
1562778141646782468 2022-08-25 12:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Discipline  Our second bucket is discipline.  Discipline is the group of behavioral drivers that create the proper accountability to grow your purpose:   - Ownership - Change - Habits  https://t.co/JAViYUPYYo
1562778135338164224 2022-08-25 12:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Environment  Your environment is what &amp; whom you surround yourself with.  Time and purpose like a seed, &amp; environment like soil &amp; water.   It’s tough to grow around pessimists, the unreliable, or untrustworthy.  Curating the right environment creates the ecosystem to thrive.
1562778132226404353 2022-08-25 12:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Motivation  Motivation is what drives you. Why are you creating time freedom?   If you’re creating it without specific motivation, it's likely that you will be unfulfilled.   The goal isn't to do nothing.   The goal is to avoid what you dislike and do more of what you love.
1562778129512312833 2022-08-25 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Time  We all know that time is our most finite resource.   The currency of life.   But we tend to forget when faced with the day-to-day work, family, and obligations.  Understanding that time is the ultimate currency is the fundamental driver of intentional life design.
1562778126274334720 2022-08-25 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Purpose  Our first bucket is purpose.   And I believe purpose is made up of 3 drivers:   - Time - Motivation - Environment  https://t.co/BUZrfqDC31
1562778119979028481 2022-08-25 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your first reaction might be this sounds childlike or fantastical.   I’ve made peace with the potential judgment.  I believe it’s a more natural way to live than the assembly-line, 8-hour workday life we’ve inherited from the 1860s.  Let's start with 3 buckets:
1562778111250669569 2022-08-25 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> First, what does it mean to design an intentional life?  Here’s what I’ve landed on:  - Doing what I want, when I want, and with whom I want - Doing very little of what I don’t like &amp; more of what I do - Being free of traditional full-time employment - Having limited obligations

1562587487452549120 2022-08-24 23:47:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Congrats, Steve!

1562532996716310529 2022-08-24 20:11:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JonLetchford I need to get into that. I hear such wonderful things.   Any particular episode?
1562532511586353152 2022-08-24 20:09:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My wife and I are going on a 15-hour drive next month.  What business podcast should we binge on?
1562518669208326144 2022-08-24 19:14:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidshestrin @TMitrosilis Online marketing and social media.
1562506868244631552 2022-08-24 18:27:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidshestrin @TMitrosilis I didn't always have a big following. I started with zero like everyone else.  Here's what I would do:  1. Embrace an obsession 1. Embrace an obsession. can about it. 3. Share everything you learn openly, daily. 4. Do that for a year.  Your audience will tell you how to monetize.
1562474478948745216 2022-08-24 16:18:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FinMaclaren Definitely. Create something you are proud of or don't create it at all.
1562474367568998402 2022-08-24 16:18:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JsonDevlin Whichever ones you know how to use already.  Don't let new tech become a bottleneck.
1562474245317603333 2022-08-24 16:17:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis For sure. Mine is about a $12.5k MRR business which is great because it's just one email per month.
1562474146222575617 2022-08-24 16:17:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jacob_cardy Certainly. Community is HARD.
1562473794043666434 2022-08-24 16:15:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kentgriswold Thanks for writing about me, Kent. Much appreciated :)
1562472821015871489 2022-08-24 16:12:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Oh for sure, man!
1562471367315824640 2022-08-24 16:06:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jarrylew I 100% do.
1562471323682897921 2022-08-24 16:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisshippPT Sweet!
1562471308130402306 2022-08-24 16:06:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz That's exactly the play right there, Danny.
1562471254400962565 2022-08-24 16:05:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond Thanks, Chase!
1562471228686082052 2022-08-24 16:05:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It's so much easier to eat this one small bite at a time.
1562470350432387088 2022-08-24 16:02:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I break down these 4 examples in a recent newsletter issue:  - The pros - The cons - The tech  And more...  Read it here:   https://t.co/E0I3H8fBYE
1562470346598809611 2022-08-24 16:02:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4. Create a subscription email  Why I like subscription emails:  The scale is incredible.   As the customer base grows, the work effort generally remains the same, meaning that you make a lot more money without much extra work.
1562470343809593345 2022-08-24 16:02:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. Start a paid community  Why I like paid communities:  Building a space where people of similar interests can congregate improves your brand, builds trust, &amp; deepens relationships.  This helps grow your audience and build your business.  Get this right and it's powerful!
1562470335731343363 2022-08-24 16:02:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Build a service-based business  Why I like a service-based business:   Generally, easier and lower cost to get started, plus you can likely charge 3x to 5x what you make (hourly) at your 9 to 5 job.
1562470332531089410 2022-08-24 16:02:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone should have a side hustle that earns $150+ per day.  The problem?  Most people don't know where to begin.  Here are 4 quick examples that might help:  ↓
1562416660832813056 2022-08-24 12:28:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @camillebnisich Same here. It's just gotta be a habit.,
1562416603219869696 2022-08-24 12:28:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GabeMarusca Thanks, Gabe!
1562416575101165568 2022-08-24 12:28:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcuscelestin_ Yep. Stop asking people and start asking yourself. It's right there!
1562416244913016834 2022-08-24 12:27:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyakshay_ But we forget to do it often, Akshay.
1562416185890725888 2022-08-24 12:27:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattbarkercopy Great call, Matt.
1562415723779334145 2022-08-24 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2 questions Creator Entrepreneurs should ask themselves:  1. Why did I stop?  When you stop scrolling to read something, ask why. Replicate that for your content.  2. Why did I buy?  When you purchase something online, ask why. Replicate that buyer journey.  Easy but overlooked.

1562122354179858433 2022-08-23 16:59:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @SahilBloom This is awesome. Nice work, Sachin.
1562111562948681729 2022-08-23 16:16:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NoCodeHunter It's true.
1562111264897306627 2022-08-23 16:15:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom 100%.  I don't come to the internet to read content that is Encyclopedic in format.
1562102654335082498 2022-08-23 15:41:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Comparison is a killer, especially when you're comparing yourself to someone who is 5 years ahead of you on the journey.
1562075919887605762 2022-08-23 13:54:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ray_Invests I don't want to! :)
1562075852191432706 2022-08-23 13:54:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Haha. I can only imagine.  Someone quoted me $40k for a custom hot tub installation yesterday. I almost fell out of my seat.
1562075678643818500 2022-08-23 13:53:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsAlexStarr @meraperspective Yep. And a great website.  He's called The Pressure Washer Dude.
1562073831312867329 2022-08-23 13:46:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ferventfinance I'm gonna go ahead and trust the power washer with hundreds of great reviews on this one.
1562073656095817731 2022-08-23 13:45:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcuscelestin_ For sure. There's probably an interesting rev share model here where you front the cash to get people the equipment, and they pay you in %.
1562073231791628290 2022-08-23 13:44:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @meraperspective He had great reviews.
1562072780123906052 2022-08-23 13:42:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonGrittini Amazing. I love this.
1562072730169737216 2022-08-23 13:42:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_jgoodson Right?
1562072711366672384 2022-08-23 13:42:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MatthewRDoan Or just run a business that makes $2k per day and be super satisfied.
1562072366431215618 2022-08-23 13:40:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theserhatsozen Good!

1562071685582491649 2022-08-23 13:38:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There's a guy power washing my house right now for $750 and it takes 90 minutes.  Says he's booked out 6 weeks.  Wow.  P.S. Yes I understand there are costs to this business, but goodness...
1562055910847090690 2022-08-23 12:35:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks Same here, man.  My best comments become posts.

1562053207739830272 2022-08-23 12:24:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Luke360 Sure thing, Lucas.
1562053175359803392 2022-08-23 12:24:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattbarkercopy Lots of different ones:  - Stories - Observations - Contrarian takes - Listicles - Past vs. Present - Present vs. Future - Threads - 3 Tweets with link  Etc.
1562052968999952384 2022-08-23 12:23:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide I often do.   This is a repeated Tweet.

1562052323622395907 2022-08-23 12:21:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Endless, Dhruv.
1562051845450858496 2022-08-23 12:19:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> An easy way to write more Twitter content:  1. Write a Tweet 2. Rewrite it in 6 different ways 3. Schedule it once per month for 6 months 4. Repeat.  Learn to say 1 thing 1,000 ways.  You'll never run out of ideas.

1561878907728666625 2022-08-23 00:52:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour I'm laughing so hard at this right now. 😂
1561760905326727168 2022-08-22 17:03:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The older I get, the more I realize self-confidence makes all the difference.
1561708539659296771 2022-08-22 13:35:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sahilkhosla Congrats my man! First of many 🚀
1561700660327882753 2022-08-22 13:03:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gbaileycom Thanks, Gregory!
1561698772442398721 2022-08-22 12:56:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gbaileycom I'm intentionally not selling anything on Twitter.   I'd rather spend the next 2 years growing past 1M+ followers and then deliver something.
1561695010214617088 2022-08-22 12:41:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tspeeg Thanks, Tyler.
1561694161933320192 2022-08-22 12:37:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AAvanth I think there is risk in anything, but this seems pretty not risky, IMO.  What about you?
1561693704896782337 2022-08-22 12:36:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Tryin'!
1561692945224540161 2022-08-22 12:33:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jayyanginspires Thanks, Jay!
1561692916258672641 2022-08-22 12:33:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Excactly. And the kicker is that it's something I'm already doing for myself.
1561691980425469953 2022-08-22 12:29:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonFluharty Appreciate you, man! I enjoyed that session tremendously.
1561691850297180160 2022-08-22 12:28:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Truman_Writes Yep, that's right, Trumna.

1561691696307617792 2022-08-22 12:28:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IamAndrewEllis Thank you, Andrew.
1561691664288194564 2022-08-22 12:28:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Bello_Victor_ Sure thing!
1561691630394122240 2022-08-22 12:27:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abdussalampopsy Thanks, Abdussalam!
1561691579370332161 2022-08-22 12:27:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abdussalampopsy Certainly a good way to think about it.
1561691542632517632 2022-08-22 12:27:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Thanks, Dhruv!
1561689376786096132 2022-08-22 12:18:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1561689374802288641 2022-08-22 12:18:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  1. Observe your schedule for recurring knowledge  2. Create a strict cadence for never missing  3. Create a cadence to productize them  4. Use problem/solution to sell
1561689371060887553 2022-08-22 12:18:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Use the problem to create great awareness marketing and the solution as copy for your landing page.  The goal?   Find other people with that exact problem who need your specific solution.
1561689369265819649 2022-08-22 12:18:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 4: Turn your own problem and solution into sales copy  The best part about selling work you're already doing is that you know exactly why you're doing it.  You know the problem it solves.   You know how it works.   You know how it feels to have the solution in hand.
1561689366690496512 2022-08-22 12:18:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> On the 13th of each month, I spend 30 minutes putting these templates into an email for members.   I add color commentary, show examples, &amp; categorize them by content "style".  I priced it at $9/month to give creators an affordable way to create high-quality content at scale.  https://t.co/tbXHkYqsMF
1561689358750695425 2022-08-22 12:18:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 3: Repurpose into an affordable recurring revenue model  Once you have a cadence for capturing knowledge, next create one for productizing it.  I turned my templates into a subscription for creators looking to improve their content game.  The Monthly Templates were born.  https://t.co/fJZ9WHPJJZ
1561689347979726848 2022-08-22 12:18:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> For example, I started by strictly scheduling the time to find and create new Twitter/LinkedIn templates.  Every Monday at 1:45 pm, I spend 30 minutes finding great content online.   Then at 2:15 pm, I spend 30 minutes turning them into templates I can use and reuse.
1561689345928617984 2022-08-22 12:18:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 2: Create a cadence for capturing knowledge  Once you identify weekly recurring knowledge, you need a cadence &amp; process for capturing it consistently.  If you're going to productize it for recurring revenue, you can't miss or be willy-nilly.   You must deliver consistently.
1561689343630217218 2022-08-22 12:18:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This is literally something I'm already doing to help with my own content.   And after talking to a few creator friends, they were blown away by the templates I was creating.  I had a hypothesis that this was something I could offer at a low cost to other creators.
1561689340639678464 2022-08-22 12:18:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 1: Check your calendar for routine knowledge creation  For example, part of my own content creation process is curating high-quality styles, formats, and structures for Tweets or LinkedIn posts.   Then, I turn them into templates I can use.  https://t.co/aIVGNK7qhA
1561689332389404673 2022-08-22 12:18:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Think about the weekly recurring tasks on your calendar related to your career, side hustle, or hobbies.  - Do you write? - Do you project manage? - Do you create automation? - Do you document processes?  If the answer is yes to any of these, you can turn them into revenue.
1561689330313318400 2022-08-22 12:18:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Once you can learn this process, you'll start to see additional income opportunities almost everywhere you look.  Money here.  Money there.  Money everywhere.  Let's dive in:
1561689327733800966 2022-08-22 12:18:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I found a $12,258 monthly business hidden on my weekly calendar.   Here's how I noticed it, and how you can too.  🧵  https://t.co/2A15L4Jidk

1561357535180898305 2022-08-21 14:20:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki If you can tell relatable stories, the likelihood that people want to know more about your company is drastically improved.

1561338264551841793 2022-08-21 13:03:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple I love that. It's important to listen vs. assume you know what to build.

1561338053167403009 2022-08-21 13:02:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HumbleFlow It certainly can be.

I chat with my friends about sports, I travel constantly with my wife and other couples, and I don't do religion.   I also am part of a few clubs, online communities, and whatnot.
1560981130639249408 2022-08-20 13:24:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Thanks. A few people took me literally, but most understood what I meant. Ha.

1560977787535630339 2022-08-20 13:11:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe People want step-by-step instructions only to find out that life/work/income/success doesn't work that way.

1560973994681147392 2022-08-20 12:56:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Haha. Thanks.

1560719993007915012 2022-08-19 20:06:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mijustin 1. Learn to share openly in a way that attracts people to your journey. (Attract attention)  2. Learn the fundamentals of sales and marketing. (Convert attention to revenue)
1560680553661480960 2022-08-19 17:30:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl Amen to this.  Use what you know. If you don't know anything, pick the most simple and affordable thing until you have a proven business with traction.
1560672594868654080 2022-08-19 16:58:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RahulHakhla @SahilBloom Thanks, man!

1560315340986503169 2022-08-18 17:19:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonbrosio @dickiebush @ItsKieranDrew @alexgarcia_atx @writingtoriches @abhishekshah173 Thank you, my man!
1560315323639037952 2022-08-18 17:18:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mjr_47 @TheJoshFarr @dickiebush If you don't look back at your old writing and cringe, you're not getting better.   And this is VERY cringey 😂
1560295995119964163 2022-08-18 16:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Throw your 10-year tactical plan in the trash.  When I look at the people in my network who are on top, most have embraced pivots, chance, and randomness.  They had a vision. They had milestones.  They changed them when data and feedback suggested doing so.
1560275435975430146 2022-08-18 14:40:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh @brandonthezhang @stephsmithio @abhishekshah173 @ybhrdwj @Jake_Langley Appreciate you, man!
1560274976531677184 2022-08-18 14:38:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Thank you 🙌 Right back atcha.
1560254807088185344 2022-08-18 13:18:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FitFounder @heydannymiranda @thedankoe @SahilBloom @WrongsToWrite Thanks, Dan!
1560253409323884544 2022-08-18 13:12:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJoshFarr @dickiebush This was the first thing I ever wrote on the internet that people paid attention to (it's very cringe!):   https://t.co/IPx81yUc0C
1560252902165434375 2022-08-18 13:10:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidfuesser I generally wouldn't, without any context.  Everyone's life is different and money would be helpful in a myriad of positive ways.
1560252437331582979 2022-08-18 13:09:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Haha. This is so damn true, man. I Tweeted back in the day and ZERO.
1560252212302987265 2022-08-18 13:08:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Works every time.
1560252018614231040 2022-08-18 13:07:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Damn, those numbers are 🔥 👀
1560249904718643202 2022-08-18 12:58:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jatimonen @harrydry Harry's a beast.
1560246807808163840 2022-08-18 12:46:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikefutia They are low, but a few tools are certainly helpful. The money doesn't have to be for tech or anything like that, it could just be to get them out of their current job with enough runway to build.
1560245874638348288 2022-08-18 12:42:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bentossell Serendipitous. I love it.  Talk soon!
1560245524766359552 2022-08-18 12:41:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewglynch @levelsio @charlierward @jakobgreenfeld Every day that goes well feels like a bit more pressure, but that's just because I'm wired that way.  As I get deeper into my 40s, I hope that starts to calm down a bit.  But, of course, I'm very happy and thankful to be having success.
1560244668184543235 2022-08-18 12:38:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisPotter361 I already do those things. So, now I'd like to invest in someone else.
1560244568230137859 2022-08-18 12:37:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewglynch @levelsio @charlierward @jakobgreenfeld Pieter is basically my entrepreneur hero.   I joined NomadList a few years ago without realizing it was his and then got sucked into his story and how he thinks.  I 100% agree.
1560244295734624259 2022-08-18 12:36:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nerita_ll @gregisenberg Haha. No investment is needed. (But, thank you)  I'd love to figure out how to build out a creator investment model.
1560243871761719303 2022-08-18 12:35:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThatAndreaM I would assume that money and guidance would make it easier for them to get set up, started, and make fewer mistakes.  Not too dissimilar from investing in a startup.  I'm not looking for anything at the moment, just kicking around an idea.
1560243695823331329 2022-08-18 12:34:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ZinterZinter1 @OneJKMolina He's a boss for sure.
1560243640307519490 2022-08-18 12:34:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thanks, man!
1560243426922319873 2022-08-18 12:33:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidfuesser "Check + guidance" was meant to convey $$ + time.
1560241430714621952 2022-08-18 12:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> All I want to do is invest in people.   Not companies. Just individual people.   I've come across so many unique creators on Twitter.  I think a small check + some guidance would be all they need to get rolling.  If you could invest in one creator, who would it be?
1560235408969056257 2022-08-18 12:01:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @useTweetStack I ripped apart the content strategy that had been working for 3+ years for my business after I had one of my worst revenue months in June.  July and August have been my strongest ever.  I wrote about it here:   https://t.co/yrJa5qpjSk
1560005710058070017 2022-08-17 20:48:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Curious as to whether or not this means reading a book, blogs, articles, social media, etc. Would be interesting to learn.
1559993771764465665 2022-08-17 20:01:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyBarsee @Moz @heyeaslo @dribbble @GoodMarketingHQ @wordmancopy @nathanbaugh27 @LizAnnSonders @AlexHormozi Thank you for the kind shout out here!
1559993296839213056 2022-08-17 19:59:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Thank you!
1559992974502666243 2022-08-17 19:58:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabrielccac Yep.   Self select in or out.   No maybes.
1559992890553769989 2022-08-17 19:57:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegoldsuite Glad it's helpful!
1559991994864340992 2022-08-17 19:54:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This is just ONE way to write a landing page.  Here's my free guide to building better landing pages for your business.  You can read it in less than 4 minutes and apply it instantly.  I hope you enjoy it.   https://t.co/MrFFMds5f8
1559991984131117056 2022-08-17 19:54:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Better example:   "Learn how to make your first stock market investment in less than 30 minutes (with zero fees!)"  - Who: People making their first investment - What: Make their first stock market investment - How long: Less than 30 minutes - Objection handler: With zero fees
1559991974945603591 2022-08-17 19:54:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Bad example:   "Learn how to invest in the stock market."  This outcome is pretty nebulous.   - How much? - How many? - Can anyone do it? - How long will it take?  Those questions are unanswered, plus I have a million objections.
1559991964220723202 2022-08-17 19:54:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A great landing page is crucial to generating revenue.  The problem?  Most people aren't very good at writing them.  Here are 2 quick examples that might help:  ↓
1559955009449738241 2022-08-17 17:27:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh @Art0fLife_ @dickiebush @dklineii @visualizevalue @AlexAndBooks_ @nathanbaugh27 @Prathkum Thanks so much, Harsh! Appreciate you.
1559933611255685121 2022-08-17 16:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It feels like 90% of being an solopreneur is taking small but uncomfortable risks.
1559915283917295616 2022-08-17 14:49:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 An opportunity not to be missed.
1559908176027435010 2022-08-17 14:21:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BJMendelson @hypefury Oh, that's awesome! Glad it was helpful, BJ.
1559880617378172930 2022-08-17 12:31:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Loving these.  Don't strive to be "interesting".  Be interested, become successful, and then people will naturally find you interesting.
1559880348888178696 2022-08-17 12:30:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Great tools here, Matt.
1559879364166275073 2022-08-17 12:26:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianMarzo18 Haha. Not after a few beers.
1559877296768573441 2022-08-17 12:18:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @9876ers I try, Sam. Thanks for the great compliment, man.
1559877230259486723 2022-08-17 12:18:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkhundmiri haha. Good way to put it, Mustafa.
1559877184445112322 2022-08-17 12:17:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thesandeep_nair @SahilBloom Never stop. It's time to add 'em back in.
1559876911332999168 2022-08-17 12:16:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee I appreciate it, Sohaib
1559876886121029632 2022-08-17 12:16:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattzdoescrypto Of course, Matt.
1559876856756715522 2022-08-17 12:16:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mat_pln Haha. Thanks! It is for sure.
1559876823898521600 2022-08-17 12:16:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jertheotterbear Daily.
1559876810002862082 2022-08-17 12:16:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WithNachit Thank you, Nachit!
1559876467500220417 2022-08-17 12:15:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom NEVER.
1559876404090753025 2022-08-17 12:14:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyAmna1 Certainly!
1559876378597670912 2022-08-17 12:14:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv It really will, Dhruv.
1559876351573753856 2022-08-17 12:14:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @insightjuice I like to think so as well...
1559876321911750656 2022-08-17 12:14:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav For sure!

1559703108464173056 2022-08-17 00:46:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dipietromedia @jmoserr It's great. A little wonky on the blog/newsletter thing (have to create 2x) but it's a great all-in-one platform IMO.
1559696715002830854 2022-08-17 00:20:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Such good feedback. Thank you.
1559696516343889920 2022-08-17 00:20:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Awesome feedback, Josh. I love that.  Considering that I'm trying to make these 4 minutes or less, cutting any fluff is helpful.  Much appreciated, my man!=

1559664021577637889 2022-08-16 22:10:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yongfook When people describe "passive" income, they're referring to a very specific moment in time when they are paid &amp; don't happen to be working on something related at the same time.  They neglect to mention the time and effort spent prior to that transaction that allowed it to be.

1559634095197589505 2022-08-16 20:11:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen Oh, dope! :) That's so great.
1559631359072772104 2022-08-16 20:01:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PigballerinaYan Just came across this. Thank you for it!
1559626648567382023 2022-08-16 19:42:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArtAndPurpose It's not. That's why I wrote this.
1559621760466690049 2022-08-16 19:22:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena Yup!
1559621743911772161 2022-08-16 19:22:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jtunes1978 Definitely. But with products and services, such a misconception.
1559621663863570439 2022-08-16 19:22:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Lol.
1559617275963101187 2022-08-16 19:05:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You will never make money 100% passively.  Ask for the sale.   https://t.co/AeEex89ICr
1559607599078801408 2022-08-16 18:26:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Congrats!!
1559588067966590979 2022-08-16 17:09:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ I love books!  Just don't let them take the place of starting.
1559586122442874881 2022-08-16 17:01:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ethan_powerz Diligence. Just being cognizant can be helpful, too;.
1559586018889711622 2022-08-16 17:00:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EricBranner Thanks, Eric!
1559584815543996422 2022-08-16 16:56:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jack_Oliver4 Literally, always.
1559584756047699968 2022-08-16 16:55:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jacob_cardy Thanks, Jacob!
1559584536735977473 2022-08-16 16:55:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Especially if you build the wrong network.
1559583980063694849 2022-08-16 16:52:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Thank you, my man.

1559583679751626755 2022-08-16 16:51:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Haha. Thanks, my man.
1559583078003212291 2022-08-16 16:49:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianMarzo18 Ha. Thanks, man.
1559582559385927680 2022-08-16 16:47:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor @ecomchasedimond Some do for sure!
1559582451999047680 2022-08-16 16:46:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond You are! :)
1559581813227622402 2022-08-16 16:44:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1559581810929057792 2022-08-16 16:44:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Take every piece of advice in this thread with a grain of salt.  I'm just some random guy on the internet sharing what I've learned.  That doesn't mean it will be 100% true for you.  But, if there is one takeaway, it's this: GET STARTED.  That's how you'll learn your lessons.
1559581808907403264 2022-08-16 16:44:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 44. Everyone has the same 24 hours. It's how you use it. 45. It's not helpful to study Elon and Bezos if you're making $0. 46. Nobody cares about you. They care what you can do for them. 47. Quitters win a lot because they know when to give up.
1559581806801965056 2022-08-16 16:44:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 39. Nobody is coming to save you. 40. Arguing online is a waste of time and energy. 41. Don't be arrogant, but have a mindset that you can do anything. 42. You never know what will resonate. Try a lot of different things. 43. Don't argue with your customers.
1559581804776103942 2022-08-16 16:44:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 34. Use data to create better content. 35. Never plagiarize people but borrow shamelessly. 36. Stop trying to be cool. Be successful. Cool will come. 37. You're a lot less clever than you think you are. Be clear. 38. Be on time for important things. You're not a teenager.
1559581802548822016 2022-08-16 16:44:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 29. Start with one revenue stream, but diversify shortly after. 30. Anyone selling instant results is a con.  31. Systems beat motivation &amp; discipline every time. 32. Quit focusing on tools and tech. Just use what you know. 33. Experiment often, but never with 2 new variables.
1559581800636325888 2022-08-16 16:44:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 23. Promote yourself online every day. 24. Write daily for at least 30 minutes. 25. Ignore haters. They are the least interesting people. 26. Help others and let them reciprocate. If they never do, move on. 27. Go to therapy and be honest. 28. Drink less alcohol.
1559581798593601538 2022-08-16 16:44:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 19. If you can make $1,000 you can probably make $100k. 20. Don't ask random people questions. Ask your customers. 21. You don't need meditation and sunlight. You need action. 22. Don't "find a mentor". Do interesting things &amp; attract mentors.
1559581796160999424 2022-08-16 16:44:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 14. Always over communicate. 15. Assume you can learn something from everyone. 16. Assume everyone you talk to is also full of shit. 17. Your business heroes are regular people who took action. 18. If you can make $1, you can make $1,000.
1559581794067947522 2022-08-16 16:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10. Your network can either speed you up or slow you down. 11. Pessimists are often right, and optimists are often wealthy. 12. Stop asking everyone, and start figuring shit out on your own. 13. If you don't respect people's time, they won't respect you.
1559581791836688385 2022-08-16 16:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6. Thick skin is a prerequisite for building in public. 7. You go 10x faster by supporting people, not tearing them down. 8. No matter how good your product is, someone will hate it. 9. Price whatever you offer at a rate you'd be comfortable paying.
1559581789261373441 2022-08-16 16:44:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. If people root for you to fail, cut them out of your life. 3. The best entrepreneurs know how to teach themselves. 4. You learn 100x more by trying than by reading ab someone else. 5. If you don't know how to sell, you're going to struggle.

1559538358979891201 2022-08-16 13:51:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Damn. This is like a crash course on productivity.   Well done, Dan.
1559529544209649665 2022-08-16 13:16:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush If you only remember 1 and 5, you're going to be better off than most.
1559529339712151554 2022-08-16 13:15:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Yep.   I push solopreneurship because I think people should know it's a viable option.  Not because I think everyone should do it.  Many ways to succeed in this world!

1559154317478830080 2022-08-15 12:25:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury TL;DR  Day 1: Maximize your profile: Why should people follow you?  Day 1 to 30: Teach people something every day.  Day 31 to 60: Write 1-2 weekly threads of your best single Tweets.  Day 61 to 90: Build a small network of relevant people and interact daily.
1559154314106609664 2022-08-15 12:25:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury I use a tool called  https://t.co/dmFMk3T60Y to organize a group of favorite follows, and interact with them easily each day.   By supporting people, I generally earn their support back.  https://t.co/UhgVGJYKkt

1559154299686592512 2022-08-15 12:25:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury Day 61 to 90: Build Your Ecosystem  If you’re resonating with the right people, you’ll likely have some new followers.  This is a great time to set up a small network of people on the same journey as you.   Note: You can also do this on day one if you’d like!
1559154297744625666 2022-08-15 12:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury Since you’ve asked a question each day (the PM Tweet), you can also turn the answers into Tweet threads.   This is a very simple way to get started.  I recommend doing 1 thread per week because they maximize your chances of getting attention from the right types of people,

Some of those Tweets will have resonated, while others will be duds.   That’s normal.  Find the Tweets that resonated and double down by turning them into Threads.
1559154293931999234 2022-08-15 12:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I use a tool called @hypefury that automatically retweets all of my posts 9 hours later.  This helps double my engagement.  It also automatically un-retweets them 24 hours later to keep my Twitter feed clean.

Does it work for a few accounts? Sure.   Is it the best strategy for most people? Probably not.   Twitter growth is NOT about sharing meaningless platitudes.

1558464501107793920 2022-08-13 14:44:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector I think there are 2 different phases:  Phase 1: Growth (mostly) on your own. You need to get some traction w/o accelerators. It's the best way to become a better creator.  Phase 2: Add in the things from above. No other big creators engaged w/ me until I was past 75k followers.

1558437053842526208 2022-08-13 12:55:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship 101:  Don't compare yourself to others.  That's the easiest way to get distracted and stressed out.  You can only control how successful you are, not how successful someone else is.  Be the best version of yourself, not a better version of someone else.
1558139055396864000 2022-08-12 17:11:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vickks Thanks, Vivek. Hope you’re well!
1558123814193700864 2022-08-12 16:10:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spacemakerco When I’m interested in something I usually will research it for hours and then go try it.   I think some of it is just natural curiosity.
1558122358090731524 2022-08-12 16:04:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A critical skill in solopreneurship is to learn how to teach yourself.   Mentors are great, but generally provide advice that worked for them.  Do your own research by deeply immersing yourself in whatever subject is important to you.   Learn to learn and you're unstoppable.
1558073884787843072 2022-08-12 12:52:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlmerudCaspian Genuinely curious question - do you use restaurant reviews or reviews of physicians or other businesses?

Here are 3 ways to collect more testimonials:  - Use the tit-for-tat method - Automate the process - Be hyper-specific  Join 42k learning more tomorrow:   https://t.co/X3l2wg5HwG
1557834171141292037 2022-08-11 20:59:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Spot on, my man.   Doing things will always be the best way to actually learn and progress.
1557790743879622657 2022-08-11 18:07:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Love that, Dickie.
1557785165526704128 2022-08-11 17:45:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Love that, Teddy.
1557783520701022209 2022-08-11 17:38:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oledoteth @SahilBloom It's so true. I feel like this all of the time.
1557782561102913536 2022-08-11 17:34:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao Damn, that's true, Wes. A win/win I hadn't even considered.
1557782328306442241 2022-08-11 17:33:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I've found this to be the biggest truth out there. When I share, I'm always stunned to find out how many people don't know it.
1557782142083633155 2022-08-11 17:32:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRobbMann I love this.
1557782008289497089 2022-08-11 17:32:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Oh, amazing! So glad, brother. Thank you.
1557781289239035904 2022-08-11 17:29:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJoshFarr Smart, Josh.
1557781258276593669 2022-08-11 17:29:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue It's a good one, Sean!
1557780449447100419 2022-08-11 17:26:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Want better Twitter content?  Take what you learned over the last 30 days &amp; ask yourself:   - What can I teach someone? - What did I observe during the journey? - How is this different than what others say? - What tools, books, or articles helped?   https://t.co/x6Rz5vGVEa
1557759281201647616 2022-08-11 16:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The biggest difference between success &amp; failure is getting started.  The majority of people I know fantasize about things that actually can be accomplished.  They just never get started.  If you get started and play the long game, you have a great chance of winning.
1557727920021336067 2022-08-11 13:57:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AkBakhshi Thank you so much!
1557727717465812992 2022-08-11 13:56:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki I see this a lot with companies moving from SMB to Enterprise. 99% of the time, they just aren't ready.
1557727580815405058 2022-08-11 13:56:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I'm going to win simply by outlasting a lot of people...
1557727467053645831 2022-08-11 13:55:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Group think is literally dividing the world.
1557727354155175936 2022-08-11 13:55:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Everyone sees the tip of the iceberg.
1557727263944101889 2022-08-11 13:54:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour This opening Tweet is a masterclass on effective "hook" writing. Well done.
1557719240072896512 2022-08-11 13:23:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Sebastian_Parra I write each day, usually in the morning over coffee. But I try not to force it.
1557713297746628611 2022-08-11 12:59:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JustinWise Thanks for the support, Justin. I appreciate it, man!
1557710747328778240 2022-08-11 12:49:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRobbMann Thanks, Rob!
1557710705368899585 2022-08-11 12:49:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aimanazlan90 Social media and also just personally on Notion.
1557707571389235200 2022-08-11 12:36:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WrittenMastery Sometimes. Some people take longer, some people get it faster.
1557707527890108418 2022-08-11 12:36:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jakobwhte That's it. You nailed it.
1557707488363003904 2022-08-11 12:36:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theBMcopywriter It's difficult but worth it!
1557705906187636736 2022-08-11 12:30:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markowonders That's awesome. I quit a few times myself before I found my groove.
1557705830635634688 2022-08-11 12:29:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PiensaCripto That's awesome, Eugenio. So glad to hear it, man.
1557705769881161728 2022-08-11 12:29:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Same to you, Teddy! I have a feeling you're just getting started.
1557705686804566016 2022-08-11 12:29:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni Love that, Kurtis!
1557704698781728771 2022-08-11 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni Notion doc!
1557704660433006594 2022-08-11 12:25:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JeffFeldman_ I appreciate that, Jeff.
1557704635099582465 2022-08-11 12:25:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ZinterZinter1 Just be the best you instead.
1557704559631417344 2022-08-11 12:24:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ebube_asadu Keep going!
1557704543273615360 2022-08-11 12:24:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThomasKStrider I think they certainly are a big part.
1557704512969838592 2022-08-11 12:24:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @notionpunk Nice. Keep going, Fred!
1557704477813227523 2022-08-11 12:24:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Similar to me. The journey to 70k was very difficult, but then suddenly the journey accelerated.
1557704364986433538 2022-08-11 12:23:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJoshFarr Love that, Josh.
1557435184714227712 2022-08-10 18:34:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ishverduzco @gregisenberg @thesamparr @ShaanVP @HTTOTW @NaithanJones Appreciate the shout here, Ish!
1557428566891139073 2022-08-10 18:08:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby For sure. I don't even think about algorithms when posting. I figure, in the end, it will all work out if I learn to produce quality content.
1557428448297099269 2022-08-10 18:07:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Best comment :)
1557427435381063680 2022-08-10 18:03:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano Great thread, Ben. Saved for my days of editing!

1557396886671302661 2022-08-10 16:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A lot of people say, "Quality over quantity".  Sometimes.  But when you're starting a new endeavor, repetition matters.  So start with quantity to help find the quality.  Then do both.  High output, high quality. Win/Win.
1557376816368812034 2022-08-10 14:42:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Dude, this is amazing! Thank you so much for it.
1557375969404633088 2022-08-10 14:39:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill @OneJKMolina Damn. Thanks, fellas. I appreciate that.
1557362980282580992 2022-08-10 13:47:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @helloakashm Sure, but choose a different number like 1% or 0.5% and rework the math.
1557362838859091974 2022-08-10 13:46:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kevin_Loder I've done $781,400 in course sales this year with zero ad spend 🙂
1557349965143412737 2022-08-10 12:55:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AkBakhshi Great question. I'll create something about that.
1557345780280745984 2022-08-10 12:39:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Loving the visuals, Matt.
1557344227402698752 2022-08-10 12:32:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Thanks, man.   It's the only way I can operate is by having small breakdowns and tactical action plans.
1557343574458523649 2022-08-10 12:30:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Richard_andey That's right, Andrew.
1557343531135549440 2022-08-10 12:30:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamsIshakuAli Definitely. It's not easy at all. But it's easier than not having a plan.
1557343465368854530 2022-08-10 12:29:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oledoteth For sure.
1557343451229872132 2022-08-10 12:29:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour 100%, Katelyn.  I find this to be my favorite way to goal set and then I love to turn these into small, actionable plans.
1557343339447521281 2022-08-10 12:29:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen So much more attainable.   It also gives you a plan.
1557343299295449089 2022-08-10 12:29:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJoshFarr For sure, Josh. That's the ticket.
1557342151746502658 2022-08-10 12:24:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LeeMcLaren11 Eat the elephant one bite at a time.
1557342118158426112 2022-08-10 12:24:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Reid_HF Also a very viable way.
1557342089473658880 2022-08-10 12:24:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @insightjuice For sure, Joe.
1557342071274745856 2022-08-10 12:24:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Love that, Kieran. That's a great way to approach this.
1557341296863444993 2022-08-10 12:21:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The math behind a $250k per year online business:  - $20.8k per month - Which is $695/day - Which is 7 customers at $99/each - Which is 475 web visitors/day at 1.5% conversion  Mind you, none of this is easy.  But it's easier than staring $250k in the face with no plan.
1557082755288244224 2022-08-09 19:13:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonnym1ller @schlaf Yep. Probably the wrong choice of word.  Hopefully the thought still makes sense.
1557082620684648455 2022-08-09 19:13:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realBrookNash It's not a cure. Just something to practice and be cognizant of.
1557050829479223296 2022-08-09 17:07:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf That’s a great point here, Steve.   My therapist talked me through this last week and you’re exactly right. Moments that must be surfed.
1557045068086779904 2022-08-09 16:44:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Anger is about what happened in the past.  Anxiety is about what will happen in the future.  The best way to alleviate these issues is to build a habit of operating in the present.
1557025751681097728 2022-08-09 15:27:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf HBD! 🍰
1557016791393701888 2022-08-09 14:51:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rodrepairs @Nicolascole77 Congratulations, man!
1557016605409910784 2022-08-09 14:51:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Gosh, that's a dapper crew ;-)
1557014161045032961 2022-08-09 14:41:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg If I need to get started on TikTok, I'm coming to you. I pray I don't :)
1557014052781662216 2022-08-09 14:40:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Congrats on the newsletter growth, Aadit!
1557013966416740352 2022-08-09 14:40:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Define the mission and that north star, then find the best crew who is pumped to row the boat in that direction.
1557013716583022595 2022-08-09 14:39:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Such a fantastic newsletter, Katelyn. Just saw mine in my inbox.
1557013633628078080 2022-08-09 14:39:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis People don't realize that the long-term mindset actually leads to the short-term pleasures.   And they tend to stick around for life when you approach it the right way.
1557013169675157506 2022-08-09 14:37:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Love these. Here's one I recently learned that has been impactful for me:  Happiness is not a destination, it's a moment.  I used to think, "I'll be happy when X" or "I'll be happy once I do Y"  Now, I embrace each moment of happiness and live in it.
1557012431863533574 2022-08-09 14:34:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rodrepairs @Nicolascole77 I would kill for a handyman.  I'm the least handy person on earth and we cannot find anyone responsible or timely in Nashville.   Someone just needs to step up and walk into 6-figures.
1556984380370964480 2022-08-09 12:42:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DogGuyJosh @sweatystartup Sometimes.   Some entrepreneurs identify a need and then turn it into a want.   Some entrepreneurs identify a need and set up shop where people are looking.
1556982351149793281 2022-08-09 12:34:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DogGuyJosh @sweatystartup Hahaha. I've been proven wrong in one, simple Calvin and Hobbes frame.
1556981893408620544 2022-08-09 12:33:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jakobwhte Thanks, Jakob!
1556981551677820929 2022-08-09 12:31:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GabeMarusca Certainly one of them, Gabe.
1556981421562019844 2022-08-09 12:31:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BERG_NYC It's an interview in the Wildsam Hudson Valley Travel guide.
1556981386036256769 2022-08-09 12:31:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It's an interview in the Wildsam Hudson Valley Travel guide. I read that and thought, "That's a smart, simple, guy there".
1556979066854596608 2022-08-09 12:21:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel The great part is sometimes they will tell you without you even asking. Most people just aren't listening.
1556978971262259202 2022-08-09 12:21:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Albadawee Love it, Sohaib.
1556978952375238657 2022-08-09 12:21:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJoshFarr That's right, Josh.
1556978931454156800 2022-08-09 12:21:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimonHoiberg A huge luxury. Picking the right one is the hard part :)
1556978874621231105 2022-08-09 12:21:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Most of the time, they'll just tell you if you talk about it enough.
1556978829872304128 2022-08-09 12:20:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 There are a ton of answers sitting in your DM inbox.
1556977704439873536 2022-08-09 12:16:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Entrepreneurship doesn't have to be complicated.  Often, people will just tell you what they need.  https://t.co/wNYe13sJjv
1556814657465237505 2022-08-09 01:28:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EliteDigitalist Thanks for the shout here, man. I appreciate it!
1556687465657909250 2022-08-08 17:03:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A month ago my business took a downturn.  The perfect storm of the economy, gas prices, and layoffs.  So I rebuilt my monetization strategy from scratch.  Results:  ↑ 32% social media impressions ↑ 51% website traffic ↑ 118% revenue  Steal it here:  https://t.co/yrJa5qpjSk
1556636244976730113 2022-08-08 13:39:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michael_kove @SimonHoiberg I don’t anymore. My other, more automated income streams are booming so I’ve pulled back on time for money.
1556636100248174592 2022-08-08 13:39:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MJCrandall Publer
1556636051266994177 2022-08-08 13:38:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamHartmannCom I just decided to claim mine.
1556635894538506241 2022-08-08 13:38:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdwardHaskins I’m the guy building!
1556622507221942278 2022-08-08 12:45:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue @ItsKieranDrew Haha. My name is Dave but everybody calls me Flash. I can't stop laughing at that.
1556622420118835200 2022-08-08 12:44:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdsFunnelSales Yep. This one has showed a much better conversation rate than others.
1556622277810294784 2022-08-08 12:44:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh I agree. It can always come at a later time too.
1556622235460304897 2022-08-08 12:43:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ReadeMilner @ItsKieranDrew It's optional too. Wait until you've nailed a category and then add it.
1556622084041838593 2022-08-08 12:43:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michael_kove @SimonHoiberg I basically do it all on my own. So, it's not really inaccurate (at least for me).  I have a part-time VA for 15 hours per month though.
1556616075202236418 2022-08-08 12:19:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justincsimon Thank you.
1556616040360050689 2022-08-08 12:19:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheTrumanBaker Absolutely, Truman.
1556615978502463490 2022-08-08 12:19:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew 100%. That's a great caveat, Kieran.
1556614845159587843 2022-08-08 12:14:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @persuasionkid Basically just a nickname.

1556263541673426944 2022-08-07 12:58:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theareebirshad Appreciate that, Areeb. I made this one myself in Canva.
1556262065244971013 2022-08-07 12:52:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Does your content sound like everyone else's?  If so, you're a commodity.  Does your content bring a non-obvious solution to a common problem?  That's how you build an audience &amp; a business.  Yesterday, 40,778 people learned how to become non-obvious:   https://t.co/M9Q9qqFMhW
1556045470937530370 2022-08-06 22:32:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf How long are you there, Steve?  I'm coming up to HV tomorrow.  Just booked a last-minute flight. LMK if you're around.
1556021994013040640 2022-08-06 20:58:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jorgevayron @BrunoZdenik Thank you both :)

1555946089370591234 2022-08-06 15:57:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianFeroldi I talked to my best friend from HS about the stock market, and here were his words (no joke):  "The market? That's like kind of a scam, right? Like super risky and crashes all of the time and people lose all of their money?"  I was a bit surprised...
1555945556140331012 2022-08-06 15:55:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ryanlombardi1 @SimonHoiberg Smart man.
1555935942405492738 2022-08-06 15:16:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ken_carroll @TMitrosilis Should have been more clear.  Someone wrote a whole post about me and how having a one-person business is wrong, lonely, not helpful, etc.  Weird to tell me I've picked wrong for myself.  It would be like if I wrote a post about how I disagree with people wearing jeans.
1555935308600033280 2022-08-06 15:14:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @tdinh_me Tony is a mad genius.  Not only are his products excellent, but he's just an all-around good fella.
1555934830487117824 2022-08-06 15:12:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Two things I plan the night before:   1. Content 2. Workouts  Business and health moving in the right direction with even halfway decent planning.

1555934294354296835 2022-08-06 15:10:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Learn to always overdeliver and you'll almost never overpromise :)
1555934167241789441 2022-08-06 15:09:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour There are thing's I've been doing for a long time that I still suck at.  Don't forget to suck at old stuff too 😂
1555925512316489729 2022-08-06 14:35:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav Thanks for including me! 💪
1555922131581534209 2022-08-06 14:21:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby I use Zirtual. Has been pretty good for what I need.   Candidly, it can get lonely. But that’s where friends, family and traveling come in for me.
1555921943274160128 2022-08-06 14:21:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CharliePabst I can’t imagine having a ton of employees anymore.

1555909321661321216 2022-08-06 13:31:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LuckyLuke0x Over complication and procrastination.
1555909159991840774 2022-08-06 13:30:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni That’s my goal.
1555909145919950849 2022-08-06 13:30:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimonHoiberg Agreed. I’ve been pretty open about VAs and Al thought I’ve contracted small things out in the last, it’s extremely rare.   Maybe 3x in 3 years.
1555908953371983873 2022-08-06 13:29:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby One part-time VA
1555908746311880705 2022-08-06 13:28:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BlackLabelAdvsr I have Part-time VA.
1555907325050998788 2022-08-06 13:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'll tell anyone who will listen about a one-person, diversified business model.  You can hate it, doubt it, say it won't work, or think it's impossible.  But you can't unsee it.
1555880804978409473 2022-08-06 11:37:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rczyxc If you check my account you’ll notice I actually only “Tweet” about 2x per day.   The rest of that number is replies to comments and to other people’s tweets (like this).   Hope that helps take some pressure off.
1555703446925447174 2022-08-05 23:52:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruno_nwogu @thejustinwe1sh There have been hundreds.   Nothing I can do about it.
1555641531419316225 2022-08-05 19:46:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NeelBParekh @PEfund_guy It’s about to get significantly better with the September 5th update as well.
1555623782659784710 2022-08-05 18:36:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NeelBParekh @joostschuur About 30% of the time.   Another 20% of the time I riff on old posts.  Another 20%, I use content from longer-form stuff I've written.  And 30% is purely original.
1555623411644260354 2022-08-05 18:34:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PedroCastenada Here's a common path:  1. Service business 2. Productiuzing the service 3. Adding a recurring subscription 4. Building out a community 5. Cohort coaching 6. Sponsors
1555621492171448321 2022-08-05 18:27:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @C47 😂
1555619304883773445 2022-08-05 18:18:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @C47 Yep, that's better!
1555612353990983680 2022-08-05 17:51:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joostschuur @NeelBParekh That could be true. That's why proper diligence is needed in every space.  I heard the same thing from everyone in my space as well, but I've sold over 8,000 copies at $150.
1555609225916809218 2022-08-05 17:38:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Truman_Writes No worries ! 😀
1555608310027542533 2022-08-05 17:34:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Truman_Writes Because I already have a portfolio of revenue streams. That was my goal.
1555607205226881024 2022-08-05 17:30:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmAnasAmrani Or learn to understand that the worst case scenario isn't often all that bad.
1555607023395512323 2022-08-05 17:29:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Truman_Writes Trying to leave what?
1555605988727726081 2022-08-05 17:25:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @notionpunk Every small income stream that works out is just another  point towards derisking your life.
1555605850433134595 2022-08-05 17:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RealJoshHoward Same, Josh.
1555605818292191232 2022-08-05 17:25:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJoshFarr Nice, Josh. Agreed.
1555605768610742272 2022-08-05 17:24:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @finance_toolbox Sweet! Congrats :)
1555605041876172802 2022-08-05 17:21:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrishlad IMO, focus and intensity are for things that have been proven.  You can't find out what's proven without several small attempts.  Try something. If it sticks after a while and you enjoy it, invest more time there.
1555604439670611968 2022-08-05 17:19:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> More people should build a portfolio of revenue.  There's almost no downside &amp; tremendous upside:  - Worst case is you fail and stay in the same situation - Best case is you unlock a much better life  What's the easiest way you could make $1 online this weekend?  Try that thing.
1555582538441269250 2022-08-05 15:52:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao I love how you've given some really simple, but extremely powerful examples here, Wes.  Great thread.
1555566833268391936 2022-08-05 14:50:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nurijanian I don't much about it, but plan on looking into this in 2023.
1555566627294412808 2022-08-05 14:49:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRealJohnnyB7 It was a platform I knew other people were creating on, so it made sense to me at that time. It worked out well.

1555538905172246528 2022-08-05 12:59:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The best way to learn how to reach a major goal is simply to be obsessed with it and curious about it.  Curiosity + obsession has always worked for me.
1555538636480954369 2022-08-05 12:58:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour One of the biggest sins in business is not talking to your customers.  It's amazing how many people don't.

1555510825875537922 2022-08-05 11:07:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito I just mean don't worry about producing videos that are movie quality.  I record my courses on a webcam in my office.  My focus is not on production value but on giving the audience the information they want at 100x the value that they paid for the course.
1555340541562429441 2022-08-04 23:50:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AkBakhshi Best selling is all about the creator.   Most impacted is all about the student.
1555340239706759168 2022-08-04 23:49:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IdeasActualized The latter is exactly how I built my business and I’ve been successful for 3+ years.
1555339719755681792 2022-08-04 23:47:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NeelBParekh I think for $1,000+ you need it to be more robust and probably longer.   I just think people underestimate the social capital needed to sell a course at that price.

1555294825582313472 2022-08-04 20:49:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @valhalla_dev I charge $150 and my one of my courses is a little under 2 hours and one is 50 minutes.
1555294678341271559 2022-08-04 20:48:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJoshFarr @Johnson_AsiNG One of my courses is 2 hours, one is 50 minutes. But if you're building your first one, try and keep it between 45 and 60 total.   You can always go longer once you have social capital and a large following.
1555294441904263169 2022-08-04 20:47:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertoblake My take would be that most people who say that likely haven't built anything of their own and would struggle to describe why it's unethical. It's a nitpick and a teardown, vs. a valid concern.   When people love my course, they recommend it. Sounds ethical to me :)

1555274150624870401 2022-08-04 19:27:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to build a successful online course:  - Keep your course between 45 &amp; 60 minutes - Focus on 100x info value, not production value - Make sure students achieve one specific outcome - Automate and heavily incentivize affiliate students  This has been my game plan for 3 years.

1555224995118317573 2022-08-04 16:11:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ndwignall About 5.3%.  Is that good? I'm new to sponsorships.
1555224367340077057 2022-08-04 16:09:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Emmanuel__Alex Thank you, Emmanuel.
1555224321886502913 2022-08-04 16:09:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal I appreciate that brother. Hope you're well!
1555223998912499712 2022-08-04 16:07:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ritendn So far, so good. Will continue experimenting. Already have some big brands that booked.
1555223234953494529 2022-08-04 16:04:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AngeZanetti Currently booked out 9-10 weeks though:   https://t.co/5qX2vi114D
1555222921462878208 2022-08-04 16:03:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @devieka_24 Thanks, Devieka!
1555222574329745408 2022-08-04 16:02:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tested my first newsletter sponsorship last week.  Drove 1,142 clicks to the sponsor's website.  And still climbing...  https://t.co/uL5QteK6Mv
1555217955520237571 2022-08-04 15:43:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lucasprigge Looking fwd to seeing how this came out. Thanks for having me, Lucas.
1555197827894153216 2022-08-04 14:23:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 The little red book of writing right here
1555182219488002049 2022-08-04 13:21:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak What a jam-packed, useful thread, Austin.  Gold.
1555177459640827904 2022-08-04 13:02:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @creation247 I was just shy when I started mine.  It was nice to know that I had a lot to fall back on rather than burning the bridges with no safety net.
1555175879394971650 2022-08-04 12:56:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Tiny habits, in aggregate, make large habits.
1555175603971694592 2022-08-04 12:55:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 #2 is key here, Cole. Once you take writing off of your website and put it out into social environments, feedback comes fast and furious.   A great way to learn.
1555175430868590594 2022-08-04 12:54:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Formal education provides a foundation of things that have been learned in the past.  Acquiring skills outside of school shows you what's possible in the future.  Combining them is a lot of fun.
1555173871648739329 2022-08-04 12:48:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ken_carroll Well, hell...thanks, Ken.
1555173339135606791 2022-08-04 12:46:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRobbMann Let's DO it, Rob.
1555173301089181698 2022-08-04 12:46:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Same here, Dan.
1555173249788551169 2022-08-04 12:46:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NHammondDesign Then sure! :)
1555173221527347200 2022-08-04 12:46:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJoshFarr That's exactly it, Josh.
1555169452794208257 2022-08-04 12:31:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimonHoiberg Ha. I love that. That's my exact style.
1555169354131677186 2022-08-04 12:30:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lfreiredev Small risks on the way up, larger risks when you get there.
1555169298561355776 2022-08-04 12:30:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRobbMann Right?
1555169277304520704 2022-08-04 12:30:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj That's right. It's just much less sexy.
1555169233125908481 2022-08-04 12:30:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisrickard Yep. The times are a changin'
1555168591137349632 2022-08-04 12:27:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @insightjuice That is a great quote, Joe.
1555168452003991554 2022-08-04 12:27:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Agreed.
1555167993008717824 2022-08-04 12:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The popular narrative:  "He risked it all, tripled down, 110% effort, 24/7, no plan B because backup plans means you're not committed!"  The better narrative:  "She found an hour each day to grow a side project, replaced 60%-70% of  her income, then jumped all in."
1555163642366148610 2022-08-04 12:08:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDannyNaz Really solid thread, Danny.  Appreciate the shout out, my man.  💪

1554886563930202118 2022-08-03 17:46:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @prvsomani Any reply counts as a Tweet as well (like this one)
1554886467268317186 2022-08-03 17:46:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SalesCopyWizard @thedankoe When I started doing things to reach their level and realized, "I hate doing stuff like this."  That was about it.
1554878482718531586 2022-08-03 17:14:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @0xWaw Amazing, Alyssa!
1554862966205472770 2022-08-03 16:13:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @selfautonomy It's worth it!

1554861345090174976 2022-08-03 16:06:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @evyeti It isn't.
1554861320373141505 2022-08-03 16:06:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Truman_Writes They are certainly the safety net for uncreative days.
1554861177271980032 2022-08-03 16:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdrienneNakohl It shows you any user's best Tweets of all time.  So you can just study the hooks.
1554860181799960577 2022-08-03 16:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Content creation is 10% creativity, 20% work ethic, and 70% systems.
1554859550485913600 2022-08-03 15:59:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRahulMall Great stuff, man!   Thanks for breaking this down
1554859370042851334 2022-08-03 15:58:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdrienneNakohl Which tool?
1554859316695506944 2022-08-03 15:58:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sohaibgadiwala @yakshitshh @WrongsToWrite @thedankoe @persuasionkid Thank you!
1554859155286097920 2022-08-03 15:58:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AkBakhshi @TwemexApp @hypefury It's definitely a good portion of it.
1554859084301606912 2022-08-03 15:57:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikefutia Nope! Maybe some day.
1554858916495900674 2022-08-03 15:57:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool @TwemexApp @hypefury Thank you, Ross.  A year ago I was obsessed with watching people like you grow online.  A year later, here we are chatting on Twitter.  The internet is pretty rad.
1554858678146240512 2022-08-03 15:56:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Right?   I was extremely surprised.
1554858494112792576 2022-08-03 15:55:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ Appreciate you, KP.
1554858460587737091 2022-08-03 15:55:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisshippPT Thanks, Chris!
1554858305641644034 2022-08-03 15:54:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ayushtweetshere @Nicolascole77 That's actually who I was thinking of when I wrote that.
1554858251170324480 2022-08-03 15:54:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @McC411um @Nicolascole77 I like that too.
1554837589214912540 2022-08-03 14:32:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I can always tell when something is written for one person vs. assembled in an SEO-friendly way.
1554815600156893186 2022-08-03 13:05:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sohaibgadiwala @thedankoe @dickiebush @abdussalampopsy Appreciate it, man!
1554815456082526209 2022-08-03 13:04:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby @TwemexApp @hypefury Practical and tactical. That's my motto.
1554815389938454529 2022-08-03 13:04:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Haha.
1554815241380401152 2022-08-03 13:03:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 The book is a great lead magnet.   If you can use the cost of your book to acquire a customer via a paid channel and then send that customer to a course or SaaS...  You're operating a $0 CAC with thousands of dollars of LTV.   WOW.
1554814955618189313 2022-08-03 13:02:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe This is one massive epiphany I had over the last 2 years.  The urge to keep up with others is toxic.  Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing enough because I see someone else's success, only to realize that I wouldn't want to do what they do, to get what they get.
1554814472568668160 2022-08-03 13:00:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Be careful.  If you keep that up you might enjoy your vacations without worry too.
1554813693208236033 2022-08-03 12:57:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Great stuff here, Matt! Keep it going, brother.
1554813385925165059 2022-08-03 12:56:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Gary__Ruddell The internet is wild.
1554812843119321088 2022-08-03 12:54:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SadyaSmetana Thank you, Sadya. October 2021 :)

1554807921330253824 2022-08-03 12:34:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisStrategic @TwemexApp @hypefury If you can't think of one, don't work too hard.  But create a sytem.  Find a topic and then think of:  - books - quotes - lessons - podcasts - newsletters
1554807145757122560 2022-08-03 12:31:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thank you, Blake. Same to your results, man.
1554807100051791875 2022-08-03 12:31:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom It's weird to see what happened when someone stopped.  Guess that's the game.
1554807032653422592 2022-08-03 12:30:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Get after it, Dhruv!
1554806983722778624 2022-08-03 12:30:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michal_creates Crazy huh?

1554805597207498754 2022-08-03 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TwemexApp @hypefury And that's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh &amp; give this a RT!  2.

1554805595106058240 2022-08-03 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TwemexApp @hypefury Have a plan:  If I were starting over here's how I'd leverage Twitter:  - AM1: Tweet a tip - AM2: Tweet a listicle - PM1: Ask a smart question - 1x Weekly: Publish a Tweet thread - Daily: Engage for 45 minutes with friends/peers  That oughtta do it.
1554805592497209344 2022-08-03 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TwemexApp @hypefury Don't worry about a down month:  Before July, June was my worst month in recent times.  Turns out that trusting the process and keeping faith in what you're writing about matters.  If you're losing faith, keep going.
1554805590307864578 2022-08-03 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TwemexApp @hypefury Listicles still work:  This particular Tweet felt like I was mailing it in.  I see so many of these that I actually felt guilty publishing it.  But, to my surprise, it was my top performing single Tweet.  Just goes to show ya...  We can't always predict what will work.
1554805588260970503 2022-08-03 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TwemexApp @hypefury Put something out daily:  I recently connected with a creator who took some time off of Twitter.  He has around 60k followers or so and his old content used to thrive.  After those 90 days off, he has almost zero engagement.  Don't be obsessive, but good to know.
1554805586339954688 2022-08-03 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TwemexApp @hypefury Repurpose old threads:  2 of the 9 threads I published were old threads I had written 6+ months ago.  I took the hook, improved it, tinkered with the body, and re-released it.  They did 2.5x-5x better this second time around.  Nobody noticed.  🤷‍♂️
1554805584377036802 2022-08-03 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TwemexApp Make sure you RT yourself:  I retweet all of my Tweets 9 hours later.  I use the auto-retweet feature in @hypefury   Many of my threads will have 1,000 reactions and then jump to 4k or 5k post-retweet.  An easy way to pick up momentum &amp; more eyeballs.
1554805581919277056 2022-08-03 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TwemexApp People love tools:  This thread about no-code tools got the highest engagement (8.7%).  For some reason, people love to discuss their favorite tools.  A fun way to get some traction and have great conversations...  (and learn about new tools!)
1554805579524227074 2022-08-03 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TwemexApp People love lessons:  I'm not sure why this thread did so well, but people seem to love lessons.  - Life lessons - Business lessons - Lessons from books - Lessons from podcasts  Threads like this always take off for me:
1554805577007726593 2022-08-03 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Threads work:  I published 9 threads in July.  Here are the results:  - Impressions: 15.824M - Engagements: 853.4k - Engagement rate: 5.4%  Thread 1 time per week for good growth, 2 times for great growth.  Use @TwemexApp to find and study best hooks.
1554805569659322368 2022-08-03 12:25:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> July was my best Twitter month ever.  29,500,000 impressions in 31 days.  Here's everything I learned, that you can apply:  🧵  https://t.co/kST2lsCEuJ

1554534749359710210 2022-08-02 18:29:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Appreciate you man.   I’m pumped to connect soon.
1554534622326816768 2022-08-02 18:28:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @anthonylcarter @heyeaslo I post multiple times per day but just do 1 a day or 3 a week or whatever. No right answer.
1554521216576327680 2022-08-02 17:35:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Thank you, my friend.
1554521156060958721 2022-08-02 17:34:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliQOfficial Heck yeah! Get after it, Ali. Thanks for the kind words, man.
1554521086628438018 2022-08-02 17:34:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamEJOrtiz @usefathom I don't run any paid ads, so I don't know.
1554519341554716672 2022-08-02 17:27:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamEJOrtiz I absolutely love @usefathom

1554518980374761472 2022-08-02 17:26:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Can't wait to see it, man.
1554518910652846080 2022-08-02 17:26:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Appreciate you, Matt.
1554518888766906369 2022-08-02 17:25:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RyanHeng360 Appreciate it, Ryan.
1554518836908638208 2022-08-02 17:25:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic You're welcome. Thanks for reading!
1554518798937489408 2022-08-02 17:25:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrJamieWilkey @JohnIsBuilding Thank you!
1554516556738166784 2022-08-02 17:16:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamsahiljasuja Yes.
1554516213203599360 2022-08-02 17:15:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachGoltz23 Whatever works for you.  Nothing ever needs to be done exactly like I say. Just a framework that you can adapt for you.
1554516097092689922 2022-08-02 17:14:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamsahiljasuja I use a template and build out the headers first.
1554515078900322305 2022-08-02 17:10:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertgriker @dickiebush Very cool :) Thanks for featuring me, Rob.
1554513461287292928 2022-08-02 17:04:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Love these.  Don't forget about @tdinh_me new product Xnapper.  Super cool!
1554513216356720645 2022-08-02 17:03:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Start today with one post, and repeat for 364 more days.  Watch your life change.
1554513190998151170 2022-08-02 17:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Great thread, Katelyn.  It's liberating to remember that you're less important than you think you are :)
1554512801745485826 2022-08-02 17:01:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby For sure.  Every b2b company should have a LinkedIn consultant on hand to drive impressions and quality leads.  Companies like Gong and Outreach have destroyed their competition doing this.
1554511897998811138 2022-08-02 16:58:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aakashg0 @bandanjot @thiagoghisi @GergelyOrosz @SahilBloom @polak_jasper @UpSkillYourLife @TrungTPhan Thank you for the kind shout!
1554511143179272193 2022-08-02 16:55:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanbaugh27 Steal away.
1554511115023011841 2022-08-02 16:55:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agarwal__gaurav Thanks, man!
1554510574175899651 2022-08-02 16:52:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thank you, sir.  Just a lot of experimentation.
1554510406839947264 2022-08-02 16:52:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @persuasionkid Thanks, Rohan!
1554510269061251072 2022-08-02 16:51:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thanks, man.  Lots of weird and interesting things compounding at the same time that I'm very thankful for.
1554509862041796609 2022-08-02 16:50:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Steal away!
1554509218862010371 2022-08-02 16:47:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more threads on audience and business growth.  2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1554509216571969539 2022-08-02 16:47:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> By using this strategy, I rarely have to ask people to buy my products.  Instead, it becomes a simple numbers game:   Impressions → visitors → product views → $$  No sales tactics. No tacky promotions. No aggressive pressure.  Just a hub and spoke model that drives $$.
1554509213145128963 2022-08-02 16:47:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Of those 3,100 people who entered my website on July 21st, 97 purchased a course from me for a total of $6,476 gross and $6,240 net.  https://t.co/XDwFAMJ6n3
1554509202139250689 2022-08-02 16:47:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> And every newsletter issue I write positions my products passively at the end.  Nothing aggressive.   Just informative:  https://t.co/p0Xk1SpSnr
1554509194807726080 2022-08-02 16:47:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Results:  Of those 176,800 impressions on that LinkedIn post 3,100+ people entered my website on that specific newsletter issue (6.11.2022) and started reading.  You can see that clearly in my analytics below:  https://t.co/nlfhQajllI
1554509183218769921 2022-08-02 16:47:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Point social content back to the Hub piece with a CTA:  Point the CTA at the end, back to the relevant newsletter.  I use the word "steal" here because it entices people.  If they want to learn more, they can click and dive deeper into my weekly productivity system.  Relevancy!  https://t.co/kQWZ3RDvjT
1554509171113992194 2022-08-02 16:47:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This post generated over 176,800 impressions from readers who are interested in better content.  But, remember, our goal is to move them from impression to website visitor.   So, next…  https://t.co/op2gO338oB
1554509157893656578 2022-08-02 16:47:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Stagger the content over 6 weeks:  I do this because I don’t want to talk about the same thing every single day.  But, now, whenever I do post, I can easily link back to the newsletter.  For example, I scheduled the “Observation” piece to be published 6 weeks later, on July 21st.  https://t.co/ebalUI21WZ
1554509147302920194 2022-08-02 16:47:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My 6 favorites are:  - Stories - Observations - Twitter threads - Contrarian takes - Past vs. present - Listicles  With this model, you no longer have to ask “What should I write about today?”  You just lean on the Hub content.  Our Hub and Spoke model now looks like this:  https://t.co/gAJEQnVcUT
1554509140004831235 2022-08-02 16:47:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Chop your Hub content into 6 Spokes:  Once I have my newsletter done, I want to create social media posts that are related to that particular issue.  These will be the “Spokes” of our Hub and Spoke model.  There are 6 pieces of Spoke content that I love creating:
1554509136414621696 2022-08-02 16:47:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create a Hub piece of long-form content:  We’re going to start with a Hub piece of long-form content, like a:   - Newsletter - Podcast - Video  My Hub piece of content is my Saturday newsletter, The Saturday Solopreneur.  In June, I wrote this issue about content production:  https://t.co/ikArSxvlUQ
1554509126390136838 2022-08-02 16:47:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are far more than just monetary benefits to this:  1. It’s easier to stay focused 2. It’s easier to create more relevant content, faster 3. You’re sales pitch and "asks" will be way more natural 4. You’ll show off your deep expertise in your topic of choice  Let's dive in:
1554509123097608192 2022-08-02 16:47:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I made $142,000 selling online courses in July.  That's a 50.7% improvement from June.  It's all from a new content &amp; monetization strategy.  Steal it for your business here:  🧵  https://t.co/DYnRU3mTbZ
1554497393026015233 2022-08-02 16:00:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Just saw this on LinkedIn.  Bookmarked, my man.
1554471625747226624 2022-08-02 14:18:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JohnIsBuilding @SeanPHogue @TKAllDay62 @keyurkumbhare Thanks everyone! Motivation to keep going.
1554452574882992139 2022-08-02 13:02:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me Thanks for building such a great tool, Tony.  I'm loving it.
1554450073718820865 2022-08-02 12:52:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Audience is a recurring group of people with whom you interact.  Distribution is learning how to leverage that channel to create revenue.
1554449789726646273 2022-08-02 12:51:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Great advice here, Andrew.  I talk to people about launching products and services and they are always worried about "excluding" by getting more focused.  Wrong mindset. Don't widen your base.   Instead, be the no-brainer choice in a smaller one.
1554449413984092162 2022-08-02 12:49:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush 1 idea, 1 block of time, 1 tab.
1554448317286842369 2022-08-02 12:45:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl I really enjoyed Factfulness by Hans Rosling.  At a time when I felt really downtrodden about the world, it provided a better lens through which to view it.  I still read it once per year.
1554447718889701377 2022-08-02 12:43:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Do this each morning for either a 5-mile outside walk or a 3-mile treadmill walk.  Urge is always there, but this is the best creative time (for me).  Stay off that phone.
1554447418321784832 2022-08-02 12:41:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 The romantic notion of sitting in a log cabin, writing for years and releasing some smash hit is highly unlikely.  Just publish daily for your readers and follow their signals.  (a lot less lonely too!)
1554447016796848129 2022-08-02 12:40:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ericleynolds I think that's probably pretty true.
1554446950862405633 2022-08-02 12:40:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TKAllDay62 For sure. That's why I recommend getting deep on one before moving to another.
1554446888207892486 2022-08-02 12:39:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue It certainly does, Sean. You're learning and growing and that's what matters.
1554445355227529216 2022-08-02 12:33:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CharlesNwani_ Absolutely, Charles.
1554445316954406912 2022-08-02 12:33:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jacob_cardy Yep.
1554445280413712384 2022-08-02 12:33:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GabeMarusca I'd focus on whatever has the lowest barrier to entry for you personally.
1554445205209743360 2022-08-02 12:33:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRahulMall I started by writing about SaaS sales for revenue leaders. It morphed over the last 3 years.
1554444236673765377 2022-08-02 12:29:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJoshFarr For sure, Josh.
1554444216364834816 2022-08-02 12:29:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @francis_oleh Taking knowledge you have or services you offer and turning them into a product.
1554444136509542400 2022-08-02 12:28:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theactionpod 1 by 1.
1554444123016413185 2022-08-02 12:28:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theantonioreza Thanks, Antonio!
1554444080754659333 2022-08-02 12:28:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj Exactly. Find the lowest barrier to entry for you and start there.
1554444004388999168 2022-08-02 12:28:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv 1 by 1 by 1.
1554443927800930304 2022-08-02 12:28:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Congrats, brother. Keep it coming!
1554443175044988933 2022-08-02 12:25:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The most successful creators are always building leverage:  - Capital - Network - Audience - Community - Distribution - Productization  Choose a path, get to 100%, and then add another.  Diversified leverage maximizes your chance of success.
1554265548611112962 2022-08-02 00:39:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_AmirJ I meant a $300k salary one day, then laid off and have zero income the next.

1554227083441733640 2022-08-01 22:06:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Drew59600964 I was an executive at a startup company.
1554226980933050368 2022-08-01 22:06:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AkBakhshi Burnout ultimately led to a massive panic attack. That was it.
1554211297910308871 2022-08-01 21:03:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndrewMerle The market. Push your idea out there and learn from experience.

1554193840495534080 2022-08-01 19:54:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @valtterikujala I do not. I don't want any employees or to manage anyone.
1554193703224352768 2022-08-01 19:53:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @getdailyidea That's why I recommend this approach:   https://t.co/ZMikU5Lef2

1554152017316257792 2022-08-01 17:08:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidnairn Same here, David.
1554151996835471363 2022-08-01 17:08:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlKaufmanADI Absolutely, Karl. That's how I think about it.
1554151933849509888 2022-08-01 17:07:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Thank you, Dhruv.
1554150747406843907 2022-08-01 17:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3 Lies About Solopreneurship:  1. It's risky: I've seen more people go from $300k to $0 overnight w/ layoffs than fail as solopreneurs  2 You have no help: I have an incredible spouse, VA, and support system.  3. You must go all in: Diversifying my revenue has created stability.
1554150139580801026 2022-08-01 17:00:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays Thank you, my friend. Much appreciated.

1554143958271496194 2022-08-01 16:36:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Thank you, Dan!
1554143923093880832 2022-08-01 16:36:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @benjaminbseiler Definitely. I just think doing 1 meaningful thing each day is helpful. Could just be a bike ride, a great conversation, or a few pages of a book.
1554143781829722120 2022-08-01 16:35:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @khemaridh I love that term, Khe.

1554092520421867522 2022-08-01 13:11:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @prabhathonline About 4k. I didn't start actively writing consistently until October 2021.
1554092370282545152 2022-08-01 13:11:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Most people consider side hustles a liability, but they are actually a sneak peek at someone's work ethic.
1554092271196422146 2022-08-01 13:10:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Congrats!

1554089984432525313 2022-08-01 13:01:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Partner that with a solid recurring revenue stream, and you've just increased survival rate.
1554089613618208770 2022-08-01 13:00:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki You've got that playbook down, my man.
1554088737809858561 2022-08-01 12:56:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yakshitshh Do something much smaller.  Read 5 pages. Go for a 10-minute walk. Talk to a smart friend.  All of those make it a better day than zero.
1554088596059131906 2022-08-01 12:56:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ownit_Fran That's right, my man. Just know your values and stick to them.
1554088529625587717 2022-08-01 12:55:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theBMcopywriter Good stuff, Zohaib!
1554088466258055171 2022-08-01 12:55:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sahilkhosla Get moving. Then learn.

1554082805285543937 2022-08-01 12:33:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @insightjuice I agree with that. My life and business are quite intertwined.  By designing my business a certain way, I get to enjoy life more than I might otherwise.

1554080857492684801 2022-08-01 12:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #24: Stand for something (but not everything)  While it's important to fight for your causes, you can't please everyone.  You'll never "do right" by 100% of people, so don't try and don't worry about it.  Know your values. Stay 100% true to them. Move the mission forward.
1554080855391444992 2022-08-01 12:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #23: Speak up  When you see something wrong, say something.  If you feel strongly about a cause, speak up about it.  Only wimps run their business with zero personality and avoid all conflict.  What's the point of getting wealthy if you're not true to yourself?
1554080853436792833 2022-08-01 12:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #22: Use data and your ears  "Data is everything".  No, it isn't.   I've built a multi-million dollar one-person business &amp; a $70M SaaS.  Data is important, but it doesn't say everything.  Get out and talk to people, especially your customers.  Quantitative &amp; Qualitative
1554080851394273282 2022-08-01 12:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #21: Say no more often  I know your uncle's dog-sitter has a podcast with 9 listeners, but you have friends and family who want to spend time with you.  And you've got a business to build.  When you say yes to everything, you're saying no to family and friends.
1554080849494147072 2022-08-01 12:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #20: Get paid so you can help others  Most people have a crap relationship with money.  If you do, you become one of those people who think they're helping because they complain on the internet all day long. Silly.  Money drives change.  Get some so you can actually help.
1554080847359246337 2022-08-01 12:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #19: Understand your hourly value  Once you find a price that people are willing to pay you, ignore those who aren't.  Your job isn't to service everyone, it's to be the exact right solution for the exactly right customer.   Know your value and don't waver.
1554080845312442369 2022-08-01 12:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #18: Take lots of small risks  Everyone wants to be successful and wealthy, but nobody wants to get out of their comfort zone.  It doesn't work that way.  Don't make silly mistakes, but move to that place, start that thing, publish that content, and get on that stage.
1554080843206909952 2022-08-01 12:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #17: Cut people who don't reciprocate  The healthiest way to show that you're invested in a relationship is to reciprocate.  If you're always there for someone and they aren't there for you?  Cancel that relationship.   It's a two-way street.
1554080841256640514 2022-08-01 12:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #16: Read the room  Do people cut you off constantly in the middle of explaining things?  You probably talk too much. Stop.  Constantly arguing?   You probably don't listen enough. Start.  Ask people how you can improve and be open to their suggestions.
1554080839293599744 2022-08-01 12:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #15: Don't be a liability  Everyone is f*cking busy.  Nobody has a bunch of free time to pander to someone who can't even take 10 seconds to Google how something works.  If you can't function on your own, you're a liability.  Don't be one.
1554080837339156483 2022-08-01 12:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #14: Ignore the hate  No matter what you choose to do, someone will hate it.  But, they don't really hate you or your business.  They hate themselves and they express it by tearing successful people down.  Block and move on.
1554080834696744963 2022-08-01 12:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #13: Look out for number one  You'll never find time for your friends, family, and business if you can't learn how to say no to things that are less important.  "You can't help the world until you help yourself" - Kendrick Lamar  Get yourself right, then go help others.
1554080832666701825 2022-08-01 12:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #12: Average competence is enough  90% of the people that I meet who are successful don't have a superior intellect.  Sure, they're usually decently intelligent, but rarely "genius".  They have a bias toward action and learn from everything that happens.  That's it.
1554080830515036160 2022-08-01 12:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #11: Learn to accept responsibility  Learning to take responsibility for your failures is an epiphany-like moment.  If it's always somebody's fault or some company's fault, you're never going to grow.  People who blame everyone but themselves are cancer to business.
1554080823783133190 2022-08-01 12:25:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #10: Your knowledge has value  Once you begin to learn valuable information, you'll forget what it was like NOT to know it.  But, amazingly, the stuff we think everyone knows?  They don't.  Your knowledge is valuable and should be treated as such.  Don't forget that.
1554080821241413632 2022-08-01 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #9: Expertise is subjective  Most people don't get started because they think:  "I'm not an expert!"   Nonsense.  Everyone's an expert compared to someone else.   Find those people a few steps behind you on the journey and you have an audience that views you as one.
1554080819072876544 2022-08-01 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #8: No "zero" days  A "zero" day is when you do nothing to push yourself forward.  Don't have those days.  That doesn't mean "don't take time off" or "don't vacation".  Hustle 24/7 is silly.  1 meaningful conversation or reading 5 pages means you're advancing.
1554080816967389184 2022-08-01 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #7: Be auto-didactic  If you can't learn to teach yourself, then you're going to struggle to build anything meaningful.  I don't have all the answers. Google doesn't have all the answers. Your mentor doesn't have all the answers.  Go learn by doing things on your own.
1554080814534647808 2022-08-01 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #6: Learn to write  There is no better skill for marketing yourself and your business than writing.  Write every single day.  Don't even worry about if it's good. Just do it.  If you do, you'll look back one day and realize just how much better you've become.
1554080812534009857 2022-08-01 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #5: Comparison really is a thief  Don't compare where you are at, to where I'm at or anyone else.  We're all running completely different races with totally different start dates.  Don't worry about anyone else.  Just finish your race.
1554080810483027968 2022-08-01 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #4: Audit your environment  You can't win surrounded by pessimists &amp; haters.  Nothing will help you accelerate faster than by surrounding yourself with high-quality, high-integrity, motivated, optimistic people.  People either give you energy or take it.   Choose wisely.
1554080808360632320 2022-08-01 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #3: Persistence pays  If you believe in your idea, stick with it.  You'll hear some "No's". That's to be expected!  Don't be defeated, but also don't do the same thing if ALL you're hearing is "No."  Learn from the no's and adjust your strategy accordingly.
1554080806137745408 2022-08-01 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #2: Consistency wins  The best builders tend to show up every single day.  Are there cases where this isn't true? Certainly.  Is it true in 90% of the best business builders I talk to? Yes.  Sometimes, being the last person standing wins.
1554080803327512576 2022-08-01 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lesson #1: Just start  The most prolific business builders don't procrastinate or wait until everything is "perfect".  It never will be.  They simply start, then learn as they go.  Have an idea? Put it out into the market and test it out.

1553758839530754048 2022-07-31 15:05:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe My entire world changed when I started saying no to things I didn't enjoy doing.  Funny how there is automatically more time to focus when you make that one change.

1552691999899361280 2022-07-28 16:26:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luisgdelafuente Ha. Wasn't trying to be cynical, just realistic.  I wish more well-intentioned people were serial self-promoters.  I'm trying to fill that gap :)
1552690578634194945 2022-07-28 16:20:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luisgdelafuente Depends on your definition of "best". Most of the people who are "best" at their thing are too scared to tell anyone about it.  Therefore, you get serial self-promoters at the top. They went for it and got it.
1552689692641992705 2022-07-28 16:17:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRobbMann Awesome thread, Rob.  Appreciate you including me here!

1552631267295903745 2022-07-28 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd When people ask questions, share the link:  Now, when people ask questions, you can share your brand new link.  Sure, some people won't book, but some will.   And if 3-4 people do, you're paying off that mortgage faster than ever.  Congrats! You have your first side hustle.
1552631265299505152 2022-07-28 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd Continue focusing on the problem you solve:  The next part is critical.  Keep creating that red pill content!  Now that you have your business set up, you're ready to drive customers.  Push out content daily on LinkedIn/Twitter or anywhere else you normally hang out.
1552631263395287040 2022-07-28 12:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd Add the link to your social profiles:  Attach your Carrd landing page to a custom URL and add it to your social pages.  - Twitter Bio - A personal website - LinkedIn featured section - Your YouTube Page  And anywhere else that people can find you online.
1552631261285457923 2022-07-28 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd Open up a few slots outside of your 9 to 5:  Pick a few times outside of your 9 to 5 where you'd like to make a bit of extra cash.  Maybe it's just 3-4 hours per week, but if you fill those slots, that's an extra $2,000 or more per month.  That's some people's mortgage!
1552631259406499841 2022-07-28 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd Choose a reasonable price point:  Start with a price that people are willing to pay.  But make it 2x to 3x what you make at work.  For example, if you make $100k at work, that's basically $50/hour.  Try $150/hour.  Experiment often to find the sweet spot.
1552631257053515777 2022-07-28 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd Create a paid coaching call:  "From X to Y in 60 minutes"  The more specific you can make the outcome, the better.  It's not: "Learn to code" It's: "From clueless to coding your first HTML page in 60 minutes."  The outcome is clear.  You'll learn to code your first page in HTML.
1552631254893338624 2022-07-28 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd Open up a Calendly account:  Open up a Calendly account &amp; embed it on your landing page.  This provides a frictionless, seamless way to get people into your calendar for your new business consulting/coaching.  Now, let's make it easy for people to understand what they'll get.
1552631253043761156 2022-07-28 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd Embed 5-8 testimonials:  Social proof helps close deals.  Ask the 10 people you helped for free to write you some.  Tell them to talk about the problem they had and how you solved it.  Put the testimonials near the top so people see them.  Get some near your "buy" button.
1552631250728394752 2022-07-28 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP Build a landing page on Carrd ($19):  Once you have a standardized process, you need a place to offer it.  I recommend using @Carrd to build simple, beautiful, functional landing pages for just $19 per year.  Here are 5 tips for building a great one:
1552631248228589569 2022-07-28 12:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP Create standard processes:  Once you understand the problem, you need a solution.  But it's best when standardized.  A step-by-step process that predictably delivers high-quality results for the people you intend to help.  This is a more scalable process than ad-libbing it.
1552631246123159552 2022-07-28 12:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP Chat with 10 people for free:  Work to get 10 people on Zoom who have the same problem.  A problem you can solve with your "red pill" thinking.  Do deep discovery in 4 levels:  L1: Technical problem L2: Historical problem L3: Financial impact L4: Personal impact
1552631244206342145 2022-07-28 12:25:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP Look for questions + DM opportunities:  When you create content like that, you're going to get questions.  Questions present opportunity.  When you're starting, leverage a combo of public/private responses.  Answer questions publically, and take it to DM to add deeper context.
1552631242247503872 2022-07-28 12:25:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create Red Pill content around one challenge:  "Red pill" content is something I heard @ShaanVP say and I've never forgotten it.  Your content should present a new take. A new angle.  A different approach than other people take to solve a challenge.  Be different.
1552631240129486848 2022-07-28 12:25:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Clean up your profiles:  Your social media profiles are mini landing pages.  With one glance, prospects should know:  - Who you are - What journey you are on - What people should expect if they follow you  Capture attention by being clear, not clever.
1552631238149783552 2022-07-28 12:25:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> By the end of this thread you will have:  1. Clear social profiles 2. "Red pill" content 3. Deep customer knowledge 4. A standardized service business 5. Simple technology to run it 6. Great social proof for it 7. A seamless process for making $$  Let's go ↓

1552291911154761729 2022-07-27 13:56:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1552291907845365760 2022-07-27 13:56:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Funnel People To Your Website:  There's a workaround for linking out on LinkedIn.  Write a good long-form piece of content, and add a link at the bottom.  Close out the "preview" image and then post.  20% reduction in impressions doesn't matter when your CTR is improved 6x!  https://t.co/QJeoGqWicV
1552291896101322752 2022-07-27 13:56:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> LinkedIn Newsletter:  You can apply for, and get a LinkedIn newsletter easily.  When you launch your newsletter's first issue, LinkedIn will promote it to all of your followers.  That's why it's good to get 10k to 15k followers first, then launch.  https://t.co/8GwLUmGdsv
1552291882348298241 2022-07-27 13:56:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Notification Bell:  It used to be that LinkedIn didn't have a notification bell, like Twitter.  That changed a few months ago.  Now, you can set it up to receive notifications for when your favorite creators drop new content.  https://t.co/bKcbjyVAvg
1552291870457331712 2022-07-27 13:56:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Carousel Posts:  Last week, LinkedIn officially rolled out their carousel beta and people are taking advantage of them.  Just create a 4X5 inch Canva PDF and upload it.  Easy win.  https://t.co/MbrbtpsYJs
1552291857920565254 2022-07-27 13:56:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Profile URL Link:  I drive at least 100 people to my website each day via the new LinkedIn profile URL.  You simply edit your profile, scroll to the bottom and add a link.  Similar to a link in your Twitter bio, but can be edited to display as a CTA.  https://t.co/w8q0YnyMGJ
1552291842133311488 2022-07-27 13:56:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Leverage Little-Known Features:  Here are a few little-known features you can use to grow:  1. Profile URL link 2. Carousel posts 3. Notification bell 4. LinkedIn Newsletter
1552291839088156672 2022-07-27 13:56:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Interact With Top Creators:  When I was getting started, I wanted to build a high-quality network.  Here's how:  1. Shared a resource 2. Engaged with their content 3. Featured them in my newsletter 4. Praised something specific they did 5. Introduced them to someone meaningful
1552291836684865540 2022-07-27 13:56:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Recycle for 2x Engagement:  After 3 years, I have over 1,500 pieces of unique content.  So, for my 2nd post (Noon CST), I recycle.  I go back 365 days and update a piece of content from last year.  There are 100k+ new followers who never saw it.  And most people won't remember.
1552291834147340288 2022-07-27 13:56:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Takeaway &amp; CTC:  My goal at the end is to give the reader a nice little takeaway.   Think of it as the last thing they'll remember reading before I call them to the conversation with a simple question.  Like this:  https://t.co/ghauZJuxAm
1552291827113500672 2022-07-27 13:56:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Trailer:  The next part of the content I create is the "trailer."  The trailer is the opener and has 2 jobs:  - Break the scroll pattern with the first line. - Make each line intriguing enough to get the reader to the next.  Here's the trailer for that piece of content.  https://t.co/oEUFwxpmRE
1552291820121497600 2022-07-27 13:56:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Meat:  The first thing I do is create "the meat" of the content.   This is where you’re teaching something.  It’s the information you want to convey.  In this example, I am teaching 10 steps that help build your first side hustle:  https://t.co/bL8DDXYaSb
1552291812026552323 2022-07-27 13:56:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Write High-Performance Content:  High-performance LinkedIn content has 3 different parts:  - The Meat - The Trailer - The takeaway &amp; CTC  I use this to write a piece of content each morning at 7:15a CST.  Here's how it works ↓
1552291808557895681 2022-07-27 13:56:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Featured Section:  This section is a lot like a pinned Tweet but more powerful.  Use it to deplatform to a newsletter, podcast, or YouTube channel.  Have a product? Let people buy it if they are ready.   Different options for different stages of a journey.  Next up? Content.  https://t.co/ig0vWk805X
1552291794234359808 2022-07-27 13:56:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> About Section:  Your about section is all about social proof.  That means it's time to brag!  - What have you done in your career that makes you worth following? - What are your customers saying about your business? - What awards have you won?  Don't be shy.  Show off.  https://t.co/NgepXPhZJF
1552291781940858886 2022-07-27 13:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tagline:  Your tagline is often a make-or-break moment.  The goal of the tagline is three-fold:  - Tell people who you are - Tell people what you're working on - Tell people what they should expect if they follow you  It's not time to be cute or clever.  It's time to be clear.  https://t.co/DELZcNzBn2
1552291771006205952 2022-07-27 13:56:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Headshot:  Headshots should evoke a feeling:  - Kind - Tough - Playful - Powerful - Empathetic - Professional  Your headshot should align with your brand. I sourced a specific photographer to get the headshot that evokes a feeling of confidence.  A terrific investment.  https://t.co/40eghqzI0C
1552291763078971394 2022-07-27 13:56:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Banner Image:  The first thing people see on your profile is your banner image.  Use it to achieve a specific outcome:  - Build brand awareness - Drive newsletter sign-ups - Send people to your website - Sell a digital product or service - Get them to follow you on social media  https://t.co/nzqPcuedc3
1552291749183295488 2022-07-27 13:56:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Design A Profile That Converts:  Here is the journey of a prospective follower.  1) Reads your content 2) Clicks your profile 3) Sees your banner 4) Looks at your headshot 5) Reads your tagline 6) Reads your about section 7) Checks your featured section 8) Follows or doesn't  https://t.co/2JHKKvW6eN

1552271572475559937 2022-07-27 12:35:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l Great thing to study, Shushant.
1552271542284947456 2022-07-27 12:35:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Johnson_AsiNG Certainly, Johnson.
1552271487175987205 2022-07-27 12:35:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @phol_huynh I wrote a whole thread about it:   https://t.co/Xpwydl4DcC
1552271373032202243 2022-07-27 12:35:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @naman_designs Also really good ones, Naman.
1552271335732219904 2022-07-27 12:35:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti So far, Luke.
1552271314941054977 2022-07-27 12:34:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Agreed, Keyur.
1552271288311373824 2022-07-27 12:34:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ionalpha_ True, but within character limitations, these are most important IMO.
1552271195944493057 2022-07-27 12:34:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @juancolamendy Good call, Juan Carlos.
1552271158216728577 2022-07-27 12:34:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamie_dru Definitely one I forgot, Jamie.
1552271129737367560 2022-07-27 12:34:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv I agree, Dhruv!
1552268851391381505 2022-07-27 12:25:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every solopreneur should study:  1. Human psychology 2. Outsourcing 3. Copywriting 4. Community 5. Storytelling 6. Delegation 7. Persuasion 8. Empathy 9. Selling  I'm sure I'm missing something, but these are key.
1552057538912337920 2022-07-26 22:25:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NeelBParekh Both.   I’ve done about $1.5M on impulse buy products at a $130 ARPU and 95% margin, and I assume this install base will feed higher ticket products in the future (although unproven at the moment.)
1551972884226138113 2022-07-26 16:49:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kaushik_901 Lots of information about this on my website:  https://t.co/64c9clqIuz
1551972819214508034 2022-07-26 16:48:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkPraschan  https://t.co/64c9clqIuz
1551972777330180097 2022-07-26 16:48:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd Absolutely, Dr. Ernesto!
1551971638358548482 2022-07-26 16:44:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've built a million-dollar business on "Trust Tripwires"  Affordable products that:  - Can be an easy impulse buy - Provide 100x in value vs. the cost - Build deep trust to grow future sales - Generate word-of-mouth through sheer quantity  An option everyone should consider.
1551954888808079362 2022-07-26 15:37:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @singhcredible @ShaanVP @ItsKieranDrew @blakeaburge @SahilBloom @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Thanks, Jeremy!
1551954728220860416 2022-07-26 15:36:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl One thing you might try is shortening up the "Bootstrapped Founder #146" to "BF #146".  You'll notice I chose "TSS" instead of "The Saturday Solopreneur" so the length doesn't bleed the actual subject line off of the page.  LMK if that makes sense. Thanks, Arvid!  https://t.co/2vMwp6MZTd
1551929246389526529 2022-07-26 13:55:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendancahill_ @Its_Jenn_Here I don't think so!
1551927657616523268 2022-07-26 13:49:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @willstew Such a great time, Will.
1551927418902003712 2022-07-26 13:48:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush So funny man. Lo-Fi is my go to!
1551927006106984450 2022-07-26 13:46:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrFord407 For sure, Brent.
1551926975073320964 2022-07-26 13:46:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdsFunnelCoach Thanks, Alan.
1551926952365260802 2022-07-26 13:46:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets And very few are providing high-quality customer service.
1551925065578647553 2022-07-26 13:39:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LouMalnatis @craigwoodson @ChicagoCut @murphysbleacher I'd love to see you too 🍕
1551924696467361793 2022-07-26 13:37:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco Right??
1551924508042338305 2022-07-26 13:36:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sachdevasampark That's what I've found, Sampark.
1551924474240503813 2022-07-26 13:36:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @insightjuice 100%
1551924461280137216 2022-07-26 13:36:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendancahill_ It's such a shame.
1551924336004579329 2022-07-26 13:36:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool Simple things, man.  I try to get back to people within 2-3 hours at latest, and with a happy, cheerful demeanor that's focused on solving their issue.  Ya know...mind-blowing stuff.
1551923649678135296 2022-07-26 13:33:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Customer service has plummeted since COVID hit.  This is a massive opportunity to stand out:  - Rapid email responses - Cheery demeanor - Flexibility  Great customer service used to be par for the course.  Now I see it as a competitive differentiator.   Surprise &amp; Delight.
1551920620321083393 2022-07-26 13:21:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 ❄️  I want it now, but I'll still pay you for it later :)
1551920072255574025 2022-07-26 13:19:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour One of my faves! Congrats on crossing 14k, Katelyn.
1551917947458916353 2022-07-26 13:10:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TKAllDay62 Boom!
1551917933483393029 2022-07-26 13:10:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DocMikeWrites Thanks, Doc!
1551917910779695106 2022-07-26 13:10:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oledoteth Don't start from scratch. Just work to build great content and keep at it.
1551917837354209280 2022-07-26 13:10:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KalimoLeboela It's a helpful framework to write valuable stuff rather than impressing with philosophical one-liners.
1551909003499900928 2022-07-26 12:35:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AkBakhshi Thanks, Akbar!
1551909003487313922 2022-07-26 12:35:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @declan_writes Thanks, Declan!
1551907752854933510 2022-07-26 12:30:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spacemakerco Something related to your journey, what you tall about, etc.
1551907677449617409 2022-07-26 12:29:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pyewaw Hell yeah, Pye.
1551907656176132096 2022-07-26 12:29:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni Like great threads!
1551907633204011008 2022-07-26 12:29:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv.
1551907604959334401 2022-07-26 12:29:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare See ya, brother.

1551614033530437637 2022-07-25 17:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter observation:  Accounts growing crazy fast don't have the best content.  They have:  1. A clear profile: What are they doing? Why should you follow? 2. Helpful content: Educating their audience daily 3. Deep network:  They engage regularly  Nothing fancy.  All meaningful.
1551606643305201664 2022-07-25 16:33:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidfuesser @dickiebush Hmm. I don't feel like I "curate content". I just share lessons I've learned from my own journey.  Oh well. I'll take the compliment either way 😀
1551602424309338112 2022-07-25 16:16:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush What about short, original thinking? I feel like that's where mine fits in. Looking fwd to seeing how you frame this up!
1551557422069727233 2022-07-25 13:18:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo What's the saying? Pessimists are often right, while optimists are often wealthy?
1551556972968923136 2022-07-25 13:16:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Most people let the game play them, and spend most of their time yelling at the other players rather than working to change the game itself.
1551554311502577665 2022-07-25 13:05:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cristinavanko @LeylandJacob This is awesome. Thank you.
1551548645337595909 2022-07-25 12:43:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PBraselmann90 I think this is a false narrative where people are more likely to point at the survivors rather than those who have failed.
1551546897814458375 2022-07-25 12:36:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Love it, Kieran. Insane opps.
1551546843074633729 2022-07-25 12:36:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thePhilRivers Haha
1551546795540586496 2022-07-25 12:35:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @garydarna @fast For sure. I recognize that not everyone has the luxury to time it just right, but given the choice, I'd take it slow.   I hope it's going well for you!
1551546663612948480 2022-07-25 12:35:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarMasiello Yep. Don't be swayed by the survivors.
1551546589486907398 2022-07-25 12:35:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsBenCarpenter I love that, Benjamin.
1551546494699839490 2022-07-25 12:34:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BuzzRobTaylor I like that, Rob.
1551546384364470274 2022-07-25 12:34:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Brett_Trainor It often is. Reality is important.
1551546167380639744 2022-07-25 12:33:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickB2005 BOOM. get after it brother.
1551546131087335426 2022-07-25 12:33:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SikiraAmer For sure, Amer.
1551546105304948739 2022-07-25 12:33:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oledoteth For sure. At some point you need to jump in, but it's almost always smarter to do it after reaching certain milestones.
1551546003416825856 2022-07-25 12:32:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l It's advice to be taken through whatever lens you choose.
1551545686512091137 2022-07-25 12:31:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdsFunnelCoach I think it's important to take small, calculated risks, which is what I try to recommend.
1551544071222616064 2022-07-25 12:25:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Please don't quit your job and go "all in".  Find an hour each day to grow a side project.  Replace 60% of your current income while trending in the right direction.  Then make your move. Almost always a better decision.
1551247869394419713 2022-07-24 16:48:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Just arrived in Chicago.  What should I do, see, eat?  (especially eat)
1551227059778863105 2022-07-24 15:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Willet Rye 104 for this guy.

1551205632639909891 2022-07-24 14:00:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GavinSLavelle Get after it, Gavin!
1551203209498206209 2022-07-24 13:50:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Thank you, my man. That means a lot coming from you.
1551201284518191110 2022-07-24 13:43:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 If you get into a good enough flow state, you can enjoy that Old Fashioned when you're done 😉
1551201140695797760 2022-07-24 13:42:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Lotta people out here in massive relationship debt...
1551201066674524164 2022-07-24 13:42:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The smartest people often speak last.  I found this to be true in the board room as well.
1551200958746693632 2022-07-24 13:41:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki A startup's culture is often defined in the toughest moments.
1551200669683662848 2022-07-24 13:40:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour 1. Eliminate: What should I remove? 2. Simplify: What scope can I reduce? 3. Automate: What can Zapier handle? 4. Delegate: What admin tasks can I outsource?  Whatever is left is yours.
1551199176142241792 2022-07-24 13:34:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets NICE!
1551198769449951232 2022-07-24 13:33:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mathiaslindell Thank you, Mathias!
1551197409975345155 2022-07-24 13:27:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Nice! Thanks, man.
1551197037324025856 2022-07-24 13:26:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Struggling to grow a Twitter audience?  There are 4 dead-simple plays that literally anyone can run.  Yesterday, 36,411 people got my 90-day playbook.  Miss the issue? Grab it below ↓   https://t.co/xi6yiSwQbl

1550898830584987649 2022-07-23 17:41:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 Dishoom for Indian. Delicious.
1550869702582439937 2022-07-23 15:45:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CurtTigges If you build a business like a traditional entrepreneur, then maybe.  But if you understand how to build a bit of leverage online, you can certainly create several different revenue streams as a one-person business outside of your 9 to 5.  And can definitely build a safety net.
1550867123089588225 2022-07-23 15:35:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Nice work here, Matt. Love the Ikagai concept!
1550853207336812545 2022-07-23 14:39:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Too much focus on the uncontrollable. Not enough on what you can actually do to stand out.
1550853089447624704 2022-07-23 14:39:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Or you learn that your preconceived notions are often wrong, and are open to new ways of thinking.
1550852643358228481 2022-07-23 14:37:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo In fact, you shouldn't hustle 24/7. You should hustle 3/4.  Bursts not burnout.
1550852480786993158 2022-07-23 14:36:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Simple and magical. Nice work, Charles
1550852243729141760 2022-07-23 14:36:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour I feel like most business owners spend more time talking to mentors and other people they are generally impressed with, and not enough time talking to the people who pay their bills: customers.
1550848120233365504 2022-07-23 14:19:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimonHoiberg I agree!
1550848107771985920 2022-07-23 14:19:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsBenCarpenter Thanks, man. About to get a massive upgrade on September 5th, too.
1550848033541292032 2022-07-23 14:19:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nithish__1 Thank you!
1550848005577838595 2022-07-23 14:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gib_hurst @eltheobald Yep. I do think so. Even if it doesn't and I only make it halfway, not bad...
1550830225415704577 2022-07-23 13:08:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eltheobald Awesome! Congratulations :)
1550828763356794880 2022-07-23 13:02:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thank you, my friend!
1550827731834867712 2022-07-23 12:58:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eltheobald It certainly can be the least risky option if you spend time building it out.
1550827731834765312 2022-07-23 12:58:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ownit_Fran Love that, Francisco!
1550827631725125633 2022-07-23 12:58:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Practical and tactical. That's my motto.
1550827524527214593 2022-07-23 12:57:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge I keep thinking you're going to run out of Excel hacks. Feel like you've got 100 more in your pocket 😆
1550826513418911746 2022-07-23 12:53:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj So glad you had a safety net, Omara!
1550826432326139905 2022-07-23 12:53:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsBenCarpenter Nailed it here, Benjamin.
1550824894836969472 2022-07-23 12:47:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrewKopera It's literally everything.
1550823771342344192 2022-07-23 12:42:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Valucop True story...
1550823745903812608 2022-07-23 12:42:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Exactly.
1550823709946028038 2022-07-23 12:42:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @burkr_ Of course we do. I don't expect that I'll Tweet this and get 100% compliance. Hopefully just one person will make a change. Ya know?
1550822956984635392 2022-07-23 12:39:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegoldsuite I mean building several different revenue streams as a one-person business.
1550822856979783680 2022-07-23 12:39:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jameskonn 100%. That's the plan right there, James.
1550822261527089152 2022-07-23 12:36:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRobbMann Because that's what I believe in based on my experience.
1550822174386278401 2022-07-23 12:36:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @afunnelguy True story, Rohan.
1550822145583988737 2022-07-23 12:36:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Gotta start somewhere, Jason.
1550821628694732800 2022-07-23 12:34:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every news story is about layoffs.  This is the often-ignored risk of being employed.  $75,000 salary one day. $0 the next.  This is why I champion the principles of diversified solopreneurship.  Start today and build your future safety net.
1550645229476265984 2022-07-23 00:53:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_Hustle_Hustle @wealthduck @pluckyjones @ianwrush @benkellyone @ReiniLackner Thanks!!
1550600908693815301 2022-07-22 21:57:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I sure hope so, man!
1550600887479013376 2022-07-22 21:57:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets I think it will be helpful, man.
1550600847431766016 2022-07-22 21:57:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Wild huh? :)
1550600824920936453 2022-07-22 21:57:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gjsequeira For sure it does, GJ.
1550600563439591425 2022-07-22 21:55:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ashappdev Congrats!
1550544229830922240 2022-07-22 18:12:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Marketing, like most things, isn't binary. It's not 1 or 0. It's an aggregation of many things done well.
1550485157869748224 2022-07-22 14:17:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao Great thread, Wes, especially the one about teaching without people falling asleep.  Thanks for putting this together 🔥
1550459209195655168 2022-07-22 12:34:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Thank you!
1550459166237523970 2022-07-22 12:34:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @domestic_nair @SahilBloom @ElizabethSBloom LOL
1550458684664332289 2022-07-22 12:32:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom @ElizabethSBloom That's a helluva strategy right there.   A new Twitter growth course from Sahil &amp; Elizabeth.

1550220060601585665 2022-07-21 20:43:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW I’ve heard good things about it.   Might have to check it out.

1550157844275728385 2022-07-21 16:36:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse That shirt is BLUE.
1550102658651922443 2022-07-21 12:57:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom That's the ticket right there.
1550102589701865478 2022-07-21 12:57:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @petesena Thank you, thank you! I appreciate that.
1550100339256426497 2022-07-21 12:48:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tom_butorac NICE!
1550100222327640064 2022-07-21 12:47:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Thank you, my friend. All started with a PDF :)
1550100164106485761 2022-07-21 12:47:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RyanJonesSEO Nice, Ryan!
1550100097400246272 2022-07-21 12:47:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Exactly. And networking online is just like offline.
1550100048834428934 2022-07-21 12:47:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Right back at you, Sachin!
1550099947013431296 2022-07-21 12:46:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Damn. 100? I lost 40 back in 2019, then found 20 of them again. 😂 Back to the treadmill...right...now...
1550097758698307584 2022-07-21 12:37:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni Exactly, Kurtis.
1550097690092093441 2022-07-21 12:37:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Appreciate you sharing it, Jack.   I feel you on the "bad eggs".  Everytime someone Quote Tweets my stuff, I brace for whatever miserably nasty thing they are adding 😂
1550097376236412929 2022-07-21 12:36:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii "Hi."
1550096925420134407 2022-07-21 12:34:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdsFunnelCoach Exactly.
1550096880067088384 2022-07-21 12:34:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DanWhiteCRE This made me laugh 😂
1550096807971246082 2022-07-21 12:34:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic That's the ticket right there.
1550096214028328960 2022-07-21 12:31:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Haha. I need to turn it into a PDF I can just send out.
1550096075331194883 2022-07-21 12:31:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @afunnelguy Definitely a good point, Rohan.
1550096001326878723 2022-07-21 12:31:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup You nailed it.   Online is just like offline. Use the same strategies and tactics to network effectively on both.  Or walk around asking everyone for help and get ignored.
1550095591950221312 2022-07-21 12:29:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv.
1550095310587920390 2022-07-21 12:28:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav Awesome, thanks, man!

1550094623909023745 2022-07-21 12:25:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @itsterryrice @thedankoe @austinbelcak It’s been 3 years since our first DM exchange, and we’ve supported each other’s growth since.  This is a really good example of building an organic relationship over time, and how you can work with people to grow together.  And believe it or not, we’ve still never met in person.
1550094621400776705 2022-07-21 12:25:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @itsterryrice @thedankoe @austinbelcak 2020 to 2022  2020: Austin intros me to a great podcast I become a guest on. 2020: I learn Austin loves beer, I send him some Nashville IPAs. 2021: Austin is a guest in my private community for a presentation. 2022: We’re discussing doing business together.  https://t.co/EdoW4m4ObS
1550094613985255424 2022-07-21 12:25:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @itsterryrice @thedankoe @austinbelcak 2019 to 2020  2019: Austin DMs me &amp; shares a copywriting PDF he enjoys. 2019: I reach out &amp; we book a  Zoom cadence to chat business. 2020: I’m a guest on Austin’s LinkedIn Live event. 2020: We exchange LinkedIn recommendations.  https://t.co/orTRDTFc66
1550094606779432963 2022-07-21 12:25:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @itsterryrice @thedankoe An example of this in action:  One of the strongest online relationships I’ve formed over the past 3 years has been with @austinbelcak.   We first exchanged messages in July of 2019 as up-and-coming creators.   Here’s how the relationship started and blossomed:
1550094604493520896 2022-07-21 12:25:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @itsterryrice Use DMs effectively to build relationships:  I don't need to reinvent the wheel here.   So, if you’re looking for an excellent primer on how to use DMs to build relationships online, read this Tweet thread from @thedankoe   https://t.co/ojNvKCFeDd
1550094602241187842 2022-07-21 12:25:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Make a meaningful introduction  Connecting 2 people who can help one another is powerful.  Solve their problem with a connection &amp; you leapfrog hundreds of other people trying to build that relationship.   @itsterryrice learned I needed help and reached out like this:  https://t.co/1pJqiZ0SF4
1550094595454812160 2022-07-21 12:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Permissionless support:   Support someone w/o asking their permission.  You could share their content in your newsletter or create a visual of their Tweet.  That's exactly what @SachinRamje did with me, creating this beautiful visual that he shared:   https://t.co/7VK7tbkXYQ
1550094592661495808 2022-07-21 12:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Use a relevant, specific compliment:   Tell them something specific they’ve done that you enjoy.   If you liked a specific podcast/article, tell them why, and what impact it had on you.   Use a soft “out”:  i.e. "No need to reply, just wanted to share how it impacted me!"  https://t.co/zt0ussf4EV
1550094586063851520 2022-07-21 12:25:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create a value-driven relationship approach:  When you reach out to someone, imagine you are one of 1,000 people doing the same thing. Yikes.  How can you differentiate yourself?  Provide value upfront with no expectation of immediate return.  Try 1 of these things weekly ↓
1550094583597617153 2022-07-21 12:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your profile cheat sheet:  - Banner: Show off your brand - Headshot: Clean and polished - Bio: What are you doing &amp; what can people expect? - Pinned Tweet: Provide deeper context on your journey  Answer this: “What am I doing that's interesting enough for someone to follow me?”
1550094581055758336 2022-07-21 12:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Create a clear &amp; compelling profile  To build strong relationships, you need to give people a reason to be interested in you.  Start with a clear and compelling profile.   This is your "digital first impression", just like a first impression offline.   https://t.co/JEHfKz0S2Q
1550094578933538822 2022-07-21 12:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Here's what you'll learn in this thread:  1.  Creating a digital "first impression" 2. Using a value-driven approach 3. Combining specificity with support 4. Making relevant intros 5. Using DM's effectively 6. An example of this in action  Let's go ↓
1550094576794361856 2022-07-21 12:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> To start, trust me when I say this:   Your online network determines your level of success on platforms like Twitter, and largely in your business.  The bigger and stronger your network is, the more likely you are to be successful in whatever endeavor you choose.
1550094568573571080 2022-07-21 12:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most people suck at building relationships online.  It's always:  - Help me! - Can I pick your brain? - Will you like my Tweet?  A terrible approach.  Here's how the top accounts on Twitter build real relationships:  🧵
1550084280260476932 2022-07-21 11:44:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realstephenlock Thanks for the shout, Stephen. Glad my content is helpful and resonating. Cheers.
1549786747361525761 2022-07-20 16:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Ask yourself 3 questions before you publish content:  1. Does this teach the reader something? 2. Does this challenge the reader's thinking? 3. Does this motivate the reader to make a change?  If the answer to all 3 is no, then go create something else.
1549768015025250305 2022-07-20 14:47:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Huge community man. Nice work here.
1549750659922132995 2022-07-20 13:38:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Let’s get you teaching me notion tricks soon please.
1549577309669265408 2022-07-20 02:09:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shaynmtl Thanks, Shayn!
1549577307718836224 2022-07-20 02:09:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nerita_ll Appreciate it Nerita!
1549577176864923649 2022-07-20 02:09:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sahilkhosla Got the idea from watching @arvidkahl
1549576623388872705 2022-07-20 02:07:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2 weeks ago I added purchase power parity (PPP) to my website.   My mission is to make information accessible to anyone regardless of currency.   So far, I’ve enrolled 182 new students from India, Thailand, Mexico, Brazil, Vietnam, UAE, Singapore, and more.   How cool is that?
1549532735873638403 2022-07-19 23:12:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Everyone is addicted to something, so options for help should be abundant.
1549466305694146561 2022-07-19 18:48:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MatthewRDoan @jayclouse Great stuff, Matt!
1549436979405807617 2022-07-19 16:52:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OladejoKayode_1 Yep.
1549436951836622849 2022-07-19 16:52:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmPatyRubio Of course. There is some fact gathering and whatnot, but at some point you must get started.
1549436851718594562 2022-07-19 16:51:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneMike33 You'll never have the perfect idea, and even if you think you do, you won't know until you try it.
1549436779413098497 2022-07-19 16:51:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdsFunnelCoach 100%, Alan.
1549436749532827649 2022-07-19 16:51:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheChrisEgan FOMI: Fear of missing information.  The information people are missing is actually what they get when they start.
1549434924138209280 2022-07-19 16:44:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're thinking about starting your own business, you don't need another Twitter thread or blog post.  Just start.  You'll learn 100x more by falling on your face than by reading someone else's advice.
1549396328643428353 2022-07-19 14:10:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeathDingwell @jayclouse I love hearing that!
1549396238147227653 2022-07-19 14:10:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav @heyeaslo Kajabi.
1549395162077564929 2022-07-19 14:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Bursts &gt; burnout
1549394975649107972 2022-07-19 14:05:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo I literally built a 6-figure business on Carrd landing pages. Wild.
1549394868627177474 2022-07-19 14:04:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @creation247 Whatever, whenever, whomever.
1549374846907420672 2022-07-19 12:45:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Valucop Absolutely!
1549371957854015491 2022-07-19 12:33:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BuzzRobTaylor Definitely important, Rob.
1549371877537218564 2022-07-19 12:33:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimplyTom It's a great exercise, Tom.
1549371843148226561 2022-07-19 12:33:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach Exactly.
1549371772188999680 2022-07-19 12:33:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sahilkhosla It's certainly a lot of it, Sahil.
1549370876528934913 2022-07-19 12:29:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @seunojo_ Certainly.
1549370864403111936 2022-07-19 12:29:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MantaisMoney Parkinson's Law at work.
1549370830467088384 2022-07-19 12:29:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TrentAnders0n No right answer. Generally once I have enough data.
1549370782412931074 2022-07-19 12:29:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @paulcanetti Yep. Parkinson's Law. Timebox it out and get moving. You can always make it better later.
1549370675504287747 2022-07-19 12:28:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Billionaire_CL It's a journey for sure.
1549370638829223936 2022-07-19 12:28:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv!
1549370607384633345 2022-07-19 12:28:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Start with the right focus and much of this falls in place.
1549369754837712896 2022-07-19 12:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to build a better online business:  1) Focus: Pick the 20% of tasks that actually move the needle.  2) Timebox: Set a deadline to make progress, not be perfect.  3) Analyze: Figure out what worked, and what didn't.  4) Iterate: Implement changes based on number 3.

1549085413289218049 2022-07-18 17:35:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Of course. Thanks for taking the time to read it man!
1549085313406050304 2022-07-18 17:34:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @24CARATINC They sure do.   I don't want to be crazy rich. Just satisfied and with a nice social life.
1549084805932978177 2022-07-18 17:32:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nathan_Boucher For sure. If you can just learn to eliminate, you're way ahead of most people.
1549084699888345091 2022-07-18 17:32:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amorwriter Love it, John
1549084150233272320 2022-07-18 17:30:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup If you can do just 1 of these things, make it that one.
1549083755347955712 2022-07-18 17:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmAnasAmrani That's right. All starts at the top.
1549083701086228481 2022-07-18 17:28:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mejessop Thanks, Matt!
1549081014009581571 2022-07-18 17:17:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NandinoZderic Thanks, Nandino!
1549080923018301440 2022-07-18 17:17:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom The biggest unlock here is just saying no in the first place. SO many people struggle with it.
1549079989315948551 2022-07-18 17:13:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @khemaridh $10k questions. I love that.
1549079929706389506 2022-07-18 17:13:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coachgmuncy Sure thing, Gabby! Thanks for reading it.
1549079519264477184 2022-07-18 17:11:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LeonLifeDesign Yep. I don't want to be some productivity machine, but I'd rather work 3 hours on something and make the largest impact possible.
1549079368491728898 2022-07-18 17:11:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe For everyone. Myself included.
1549078997488762880 2022-07-18 17:09:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge I still need to as well!
1549078745532846080 2022-07-18 17:08:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @afunnelguy Only if they aren't meaningful to the business.
1549078666138816518 2022-07-18 17:08:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copywithkush Thanks, Kushagra.
1549078630818611201 2022-07-18 17:08:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni 100%. Most people just keep saying yes. I'm looking at myself here.
1549078534177673216 2022-07-18 17:07:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Thank you so much, Teddy. I appreciate it!
1549078059818557440 2022-07-18 17:06:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Thanks for reading it, Zlatko!
1549077358111559682 2022-07-18 17:03:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  I Tweet about all things audience and business growth as I work towards building my portfolio of one-person businesses to $5M in revenue.  If that's relevant to you then give me a follow here → @thejustinwelsh  Thanks for reading.
1549077356165357571 2022-07-18 17:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> And a normal day usually looks like this:  - 7:15a: Interact on LinkedIn/Twitter for 45 minutes - 8:30a: Go to the gym with my wife, Jennifer - 11:00a: Create content &amp; eat lunch - 2:00p: Open for client calls -3:30p: Day over
1549077354189832193 2022-07-18 17:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So, what’s left?  There are 5 non-negotiable pieces of work that end up on my calendar:  - Interact for 45-60 minutes with my audience - Create my newsletter &amp; content - Eat lunch with my wife - Go to the gym - Client calls
1549077352373788672 2022-07-18 17:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you don't have a VA, consider hiring one.   Use a service like Zirtual or find someone on Fiverr or Upwork.  “Can this be delegated?”  Yes: Delegate effectively with a process document + video. No: This is work left to be done by me
1549077350259859457 2022-07-18 17:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4. What can I delegate?  Release control of work that is less valuable than the time it would take you to do it.  I delegate to my VA using process documents &amp; videos that show her exactly what to do.  Here’s a thread breaking down my entire process:   https://t.co/RY5XsPKFXt
1549077348389212161 2022-07-18 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This frees up hours of time for my consulting business each month.  One-click and the entire automation goes off smoothly.  “Can this be automated?”  Yes: Build an automation No: Continue on to question 4
1549077346262605827 2022-07-18 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. What can I automate?  Next, I look for places to automate.  An example would be my coaching business.  My old process involved emailing, sending Stripe links, reminders, calendar times, etc.  I automated every piece of this using Kajabi, Zapier, Airtable, and Calendly.
1549077344387751939 2022-07-18 17:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The lesson, as usual, is that processes and systems help simplify.   Always be on the lookout to improve yours.  “Can this be simplified?”  Yes: Build out a better process No: Move to question 3
1549077342361886721 2022-07-18 17:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. What can I simplify?  Once things are eliminated, I simplify.  This usually comes in the form of simpler processes, or a reduction in scope of work.  An example is a new content system I've created.   What once took me 15 hours per week, now only takes me 5-6 hours per week.
1549077339547598848 2022-07-18 17:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you already have a bunch of meetings on your calendar just ask:  "Does this move me closer to my most important goals?"  No: Eliminate Yes, this is critical: Move to next question
1549077337488166913 2022-07-18 17:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. What can I eliminate?  Each week, my calendar has:  - Meetings I shouldn't have booked - Podcasts I don't need to be on - Favors for friends of friends  Eliminate these &amp; learn to say no moving forward.   Not good at saying no? Use this template:   https://t.co/VycAtgo2e9
1549077329992945664 2022-07-18 17:03:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most businesses I advise spend an exorbitant amount of time working on things that don't matter.  They are not productive.  But productivity is the outcome of intrinsic motivation + systems.   And those systems drive repeatable behavior.  Here's my 4-question system:
1549077327027511297 2022-07-18 17:03:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 questions to save you 40+ hours of meaningless work:  🧵
1549014325767114752 2022-07-18 12:52:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Epic day.
1549014270922395651 2022-07-18 12:52:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Pick one. Figure it out. Maximize it, then automate it.  Then?  Pick another.
1549013512445370368 2022-07-18 12:49:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom The worst 😂
1549009562258194432 2022-07-18 12:33:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Schmittastic 💪
1549008729789665283 2022-07-18 12:30:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theMetaFi For sure. But trending. Silly.
1549008677809672194 2022-07-18 12:30:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @webhmn Could be.
1549008129802866701 2022-07-18 12:28:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimplyTom Not gonna happen.
1549008050379538432 2022-07-18 12:27:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruno_nwogu Of course. But the article lives up to the headline.
1549008003835248640 2022-07-18 12:27:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l It's silliness.
1549007943600951302 2022-07-18 12:27:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lfreiredev The purest.
1549007925582110722 2022-07-18 12:27:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmZachHackett Haha.
1549007890186395652 2022-07-18 12:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd I also thought that. Hilarious.
1549007371057381376 2022-07-18 12:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I can't imagine having skills, an internet connection, 4.6B potential customers, &amp; listening to nonsense like this.  https://t.co/5QDMjA8JGh
1548780062916452354 2022-07-17 21:21:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Thanks for having me, Jay. Looking fwd to checking out the finished product!

1548663448862613504 2022-07-17 13:38:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I'm good at all of these except I love a nice Hazy IPA. Almost there!
1548663320886009856 2022-07-17 13:38:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Number 4 is how I write everthing. For one person.  Because if you can help one person, you can generally help 1,000.
1548663123174891523 2022-07-17 13:37:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh That's the best way. Keep this focus and everything else generally falls into place.  Customer first.
1548662607766233088 2022-07-17 13:35:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imThomasMorales For sure, Thomas.

1548659702283771904 2022-07-17 13:23:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melindamgolden That 2nd part is key.
1548659675129946112 2022-07-17 13:23:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ms_aegas You sure can, but the work is much more enjoyable.  Burning out doing something you hate is the worst.

1548658309196124160 2022-07-17 13:18:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What's the point of working for yourself if it isn't enjoyable?  That's why you shouldn't "choose a niche".   Instead, embrace an obsession.  Here's how:   https://t.co/U3KyElDKvi
1548648902752174080 2022-07-17 12:40:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianFeroldi Love these visualizations, Brian.   In a world of get rich quick, stay long term investing and win out.

1548312182764363778 2022-07-16 14:22:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRobbMann @thedankoe Factfulness is fabulous.

1548311852546895876 2022-07-16 14:21:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe And take multiple, small risks.  Can't make a fortune with zero risk.

1548309470366670848 2022-07-16 14:11:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe They are all excellent.   My favorites are Factfulness and Atomic Habits.

1548295295405920258 2022-07-16 13:15:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj It's definitely interesting.

1547607791673565184 2022-07-14 15:43:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond What an awesome story, man. Thanks for sharing it.  Sometimes, we're put in really difficult situations, and out of that comes these amazing companies, people, friendships, and ideas.  Keep going, my man.
1547571670549819395 2022-07-14 13:20:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CooperKraussKC No, @Kajabi
1547568071669211138 2022-07-14 13:05:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This is the thread of all threads.  A 4-year education rolled into a few Tweet threads.   Good stuff, Dickie.
1547295512117886976 2022-07-13 19:02:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robhoffman20 Or who haven't experienced even trying
1547295000295260161 2022-07-13 19:00:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @toonzmartian Appreciate it!
1547294284314976257 2022-07-13 18:57:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Or, "I'm too scared to try, so please don't do it..."
1547293837701386244 2022-07-13 18:56:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l Thank you, Shushant.
1547293813814738945 2022-07-13 18:56:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jsiney 100% Jack.
1547293791425630209 2022-07-13 18:56:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marketin_doc It's fine, I just never really listen.
1547293054029205506 2022-07-13 18:53:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 90% of the time that someone says, "That doesn't work", I prove them wrong in less than a week.  Don't listen to pessimists who are parroting things they read on some blog and haven't even tried.
1547291875345825796 2022-07-13 18:48:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tim_Denning Nice thread here, Tim.  Appreciate the kind shoutout, my man.  Hope you're well!

1547259193593397253 2022-07-13 16:38:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BlackLabelAdvsr No particular order.
1547259153051226112 2022-07-13 16:38:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ms_aegas No, because outside of those things, I get to fill in the blanks with whatever I want.
1547259052836765700 2022-07-13 16:37:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Andy_JMorrison Could be a bad mistake.

1547258970884153344 2022-07-13 16:37:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlKaufmanADI Haha.
1547257824446742530 2022-07-13 16:33:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are only 5 things I love doing each day:  1. Writing for 90+ minutes 2. Making lunch with my wife 3. Working out for 60+ minutes 4. Helping my clients get better 5. Having an awesome glass of wine  I'm determined to eliminate, automate or delegate most everything else.
1547229035595534338 2022-07-13 14:38:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @naval Nice thread here, Matt. Loving the problem is always critical.
1547227885613813763 2022-07-13 14:34:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Relationships I assumed would go nowhere have often led to some of the most meaningful friendships and partnerships.  Putting yourself out there is a pretty solid bet.
1547227436668141568 2022-07-13 14:32:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak A similar, but slightly different question I used as a VP of Sales:   "What is your biggest hat-hanging moment of the last X years in your career?"  If it's something relatively meaningless, then it's not a great sign...
1547227019842404359 2022-07-13 14:30:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Pessimists are mostly projecting their own self-limitations.

1547194809609293827 2022-07-13 12:22:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanaprice Sure.  Tear down a company or person who is doing a good job and share your analysis.
1547193623577493504 2022-07-13 12:17:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imrane_dessai Haha. I'm not much of a visualizer. Sorry.

1547192651870502912 2022-07-13 12:14:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to turn 1 idea into 7 Tweets:  Start with a pillar piece of content like a newsletter or podcast.  Then, turn it into:  - A story - A listicle - A teardown - An observation - Past vs. present - Contrarian take - A Twitter thread  That's it.  1 idea, 7 Tweets.

1546898207568977925 2022-07-12 16:44:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship in 6 steps:  1. Build your competency 2. Build out distribution 3. Build a service offer 4. Productize service 5.

1546478268064403456 2022-07-11 12:55:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarrisFanaroff For sure. Can be difficult, especially if you struggle to cut folks off, but the benefit is massive.
1546478181821169665 2022-07-11 12:55:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_nathanrene That's 100% true, Nathan.
1546478130759606275 2022-07-11 12:54:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imThomasMorales The first step is the most critical, Thomas.
1546474731846656003 2022-07-11 12:41:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge It's that simple. Reciprocity is the proof.
1546474101782577153 2022-07-11 12:38:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill That's why I have a "no" template. Works like a charm.

1546472004081143808 2022-07-11 12:30:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @buildinglegends That's a great point, Anthony. I don't think it takes away from some of these lessons, but I appreciate you saying it for sure.
1546471893070381057 2022-07-11 12:30:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NandinoZderic I'm so glad it resonated, Nandino.

1546468548570226689 2022-07-11 12:16:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav Sure thing.
1546468536465461249 2022-07-11 12:16:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Thanks, Keyur. Keep growing, my man.
1546467942921129987 2022-07-11 12:14:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for threads on everything Solopreneurship.  - Mindset - Audience growth - Business growth - Digital products - And more...  2. RT the first Tweet to share it with your audience.  I appreciate it!
1546467941016866824 2022-07-11 12:14:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Nearly everyone is winging it:  Are some people light-years ahead when it comes to their thing? Of course.   Elon, Steve Jobs, etc.  But most people who you admire are still figuring it out.  Every day, just plugging along. As nervous as you are.  Find comfort in that.
1546467938714140672 2022-07-11 12:14:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Consistency trumps all traits:  There are lots of skills you can learn.  But as a pure trait? Consistency is tough to beat.  Athlete, businessperson, creator, etc.  Do your thing every single day and reap the rewards downstream.
1546467936763879424 2022-07-11 12:14:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You can't say yes to everyone:  I've learned that saying yes to everyone means saying no to yourself and the people you care the most about.  A 15-minute brain pick with a stranger or 15-minutes more with your spouse?  It should be that easy of a choice.
1546467934767284226 2022-07-11 12:14:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Money is not the root of all evil:  Money is simply the key to unlocking whomever you are as a person.  Get your hands on some money so you can be the best version of yourself.   Help other good people get theirs too.  Bad people with money are what's evil.
1546467925967749121 2022-07-11 12:14:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Time is the single greatest asset:  It's a cliche for a reason.  Of all of the things I wish for, having more time is number one by a long shot.  My 20s moved fast, my 30s moved so much faster.  I wish I would have appreciated time at a much younger age.
1546467924050935810 2022-07-11 12:14:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Divorce from anyone who drains you:  As I mentioned before, your environment is critical to success.  People either add to your energy or subtract from it.  You'll spend 10x more time dealing with the subtractors.  Cut early.
1546467921911767041 2022-07-11 12:14:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You won't do anything special without a little risk:  Those at the top of their fields nearly always took some risk.  - Risky idea. - Risky execution. - Risky go-to-market. - Risky advertising plan.  Don't be catastrophically foolish.  But do take some chances.
1546467919915270148 2022-07-11 12:14:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don't spend time with people who don't reciprocate:  My therapist put it best when she told me this:  "Reciprocity is an indicator that someone is invested in the relationship."  Thanks, Erin.
1546467917902086147 2022-07-11 12:14:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you can't teach yourself, you're a liability:  If people have to spend their time teaching you simple things that you can learn on the internet, you'll always be considered a liability.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living.  Being auto-didactic is a differentiator.
1546467915540697094 2022-07-11 12:14:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10% of people will hate what you do no matter what:  I've seen it in every industry and with every creator.  There is a group of people that will always dislike you and your mission. No matter what.  Focus on the 90%.  Not the 10%.
1546467913405702145 2022-07-11 12:14:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There is absolutely nothing wrong with being selfish:  Can you be selfish to a fault? Of course.  If you always put the needs of others over yours (and your families), life will be more difficult.  Give and take.  Or get taken advantage of.
1546467911304466433 2022-07-11 12:14:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone has knowledge that other people will pay for:  The idea that you have to be an "expert" or have a certificate to teach or sell something is a fallacy.  Expertise is linear.   You can make a living helping those 2-3 steps earlier in the journey than you.
1546467909215682560 2022-07-11 12:14:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Getting 1% better at something means leaping millions:  1% of the total internet-connected population is 46M people.  Continue to get 1% better each month, quarter, or year, and you're making significant strides in the overall ecosystem.
1546467901812736000 2022-07-11 12:14:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Throw your 10-year plan in the trash:  When I look at the people in my network who are on top, most have embraced pivots, chance, and randomness.  They had a plan. They had milestones.  They changed them when data (and qualitative feedback) suggested doing so.
1546467899770011648 2022-07-11 12:14:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The most important skill to learn is how to learn on your own:  Mentors are great, but they are overrated.  Mentors work well when you've reached a ceiling of teaching yourself everything you could possibly know about a subject.  Learn to learn and you're unstoppable.
1546467897647800320 2022-07-11 12:14:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's difficult to build a work ethic without the right environment:  Everyone talks about "hard work" and "outworking the competition".  It's tough to forcefully create this behavior.  Curate your environment and the behavior is a more likely outcome.
1546467895554834433 2022-07-11 12:14:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Comparing yourself to others is the easiest way to get distracted:  You can only control how successful you are, not how successful someone else is.  Be the best version of yourself, not a better version of someone else.
1546467893260558337 2022-07-11 12:14:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 99% of people are out for themselves, even if it doesn't appear so:  Most people might find this pessimistic, but I just find it realistic.  Curious about someone's motivation?   Look at how they are incentivized.
1546467891062738946 2022-07-11 12:14:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The 2nd biggest difference between success &amp; failure is persistence:  Successful friends &amp; peers of mine have almost always been doing their "thing" for decades.  Not years.  Most people give up in the "I suck at this" phase without considering the journey from a 30k ft view.
1546467883370401792 2022-07-11 12:14:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The biggest difference between success &amp; failure is getting started:  The majority of people I know fantasize about things that actually can be accomplished.  They just never get started.  If you get started and play the long game, you have a great chance of winning.
1546467879415156736 2022-07-11 12:14:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Things I know at 41, I wish I had known at 21.   🧵

I'm suggesting that Twitter is like any source of information but with a much larger teaching pool. You need to be intelligent enough to vet out what you read.  Like the news or a book, or a teacher, or a friend.   Or anything else.

1545041477247668224 2022-07-07 13:46:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I think we make it complicated when there is one or more empty buckets. As soon as you let one get out of control, we tend to compensate with vices, which push the other pillars out of control.  A vicious cycle.
1545041142781190144 2022-07-07 13:44:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The brain is like any other muscle. When pushed outside of your comfort zone, you grow.
1545041017069604866 2022-07-07 13:44:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg This will be epic. Can't wait to listen, Greg.
1545040947943280640 2022-07-07 13:44:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches The lesson as usual? Consistency pays.
1545040882495258624 2022-07-07 13:43:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki And solopreneurs!
1545040655910666241 2022-07-07 13:42:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Reminds me of the British Cycling Team in Atomic Habits. I love watching how small micro wins compound over time.
1545022873005432832 2022-07-07 12:32:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RichFromPassion 100%. Move up classes.
1545022792512462850 2022-07-07 12:31:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theob2brebel Ha. Probably just you.
1545022754893795328 2022-07-07 12:31:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @afunnelguy Very useful. School is useful too, but it's just less relevant.
1545021946668240896 2022-07-07 12:28:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shushant_l No, it's not. It just takes some patience.
1545021910433628160 2022-07-07 12:28:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gibson_benstowe Absolutely!
1545021881862049793 2022-07-07 12:28:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmZachHackett For sure it isn't. Thankfully.
1545021851776258048 2022-07-07 12:28:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets True story.
1545021830314037250 2022-07-07 12:28:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue Yep. Gotta slog through some bad ones.
1545019620163309576 2022-07-07 12:19:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RBouschery I love keg stands.
1545019555856228352 2022-07-07 12:19:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @paulcanetti Ha. Good call.
1545019533790007296 2022-07-07 12:18:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Yes sir.
1545019511316877320 2022-07-07 12:18:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SterlingKurtz For sure.
1545019472469233669 2022-07-07 12:18:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luqmanshantal Yep. Ecosystem means everything.
1545019433772523520 2022-07-07 12:18:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheAmineAouragh Yup.
1545019418207453184 2022-07-07 12:18:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rachanashinde_ Nice, Rachana!
1545019374096060418 2022-07-07 12:18:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsjustpiyush Only if that's who you choose to follow.
1545018322118492160 2022-07-07 12:14:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter is like college but with relevant professors.
1544728193860616197 2022-07-06 17:01:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nibsio It's one of my favorite reads ever. I have it bookmarked to revisit it monthly.
1544713317746446337 2022-07-06 16:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I say no to 90% of what comes my way.  Prioritizing our time is the best decision for ourselves and our families.  Get yourself right. Get your family right. Get your friends right.  Then you're in a better position to help others.
1544699327368552449 2022-07-06 15:06:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Building out S30for30. Show us the secret sauce!
1544699074057834503 2022-07-06 15:05:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe If you take a complex topic and simplify it, you can keep a reader's (or listener's) attention for hours.
1544698893891428359 2022-07-06 15:04:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx Smart move :)
1544698842947489796 2022-07-06 15:04:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki The more I remain optimistic in the face of doom and gloom, the less it tends to impact me.
1544698613745467392 2022-07-06 15:03:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Context switching is solopreneur kryptonite.
1544659680374538241 2022-07-06 12:29:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoftedLearning Oooh. Like that.
1544659600837861377 2022-07-06 12:28:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nibsio For sure. That's a great point!
1544659560014782464 2022-07-06 12:28:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Schmittastic Wow. I love that, Amy.  This came right from my therapist and it was really eye opening.
1544659480729817088 2022-07-06 12:28:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmZachHackett Most of us need to start by avoiding, and once we've avoided, it's about pursuit. Interesting huh?  Note: Stole this from my therapist.
1544659381215805441 2022-07-06 12:27:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj True!
1544659357954199553 2022-07-06 12:27:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Exactly, Dhruv.
1544659335401316352 2022-07-06 12:27:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith It's a good point, Daren.
1544659302010568705 2022-07-06 12:27:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blairmacgregor The latter. I've conquered my former self and now I need a new target to shoot for.
1544655934005420039 2022-07-06 12:14:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are 2 phases in our growth:  1. Push: when we're trying to be better than who we once were.  Usually manifests as "I don't want to be X"  2. Pull: when we've done that, &amp; now need new motivation.  Usually manifests as "I want to be X"  Important to understand where you are.
1544655617696174082 2022-07-06 12:12:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Congrats, Daniel!   Aside from making great money, you also inspired people like me to throw my hat in the ring.  I'm grateful that you did.
1544651634017435650 2022-07-06 11:57:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sliauzys I spent about 45 minutes writing a newsletter, which became this Tweet thread, which also became 17 pieces of other content.
1544651429209587717 2022-07-06 11:56:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davidmiracle_ Thank you, David!
1544651071079043073 2022-07-06 11:54:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DefilippiCharly 7k and some change.

1544391866392641537 2022-07-05 18:44:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Damn. That’s pro level right there
1544391679075024896 2022-07-05 18:44:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YogiRavi Very cool. Love it.

1544362895739392000 2022-07-05 16:49:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Agrauro @HarrisFanaroff A very meta and ironic comment, no?

1544362098909761536 2022-07-05 16:46:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarrisFanaroff Yep. Stories, for the most part.

1544306218361044993 2022-07-05 13:04:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Exercise your brain and your body daily.
1544306037154512896 2022-07-05 13:03:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Build that habit muscle.  Once you do, digital writing becomes easier and much less scary.
1544305846783561730 2022-07-05 13:03:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Couple this with understanding other people's perspectives and you're on your way to a better mind.
1544305752906633217 2022-07-05 13:02:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg If you get the experience for the members right, everything else becomes so much easier.
1544305631204622339 2022-07-05 13:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki The timing to go all-in on yourself will never be 100% exactly perfect. That's why now is the best time.
1544304701772005376 2022-07-05 12:58:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue Ain't that the truth, Sean.

1544302915443212290 2022-07-05 12:51:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dcwhatwhat For the first 90 days, yes.
1544300774267801601 2022-07-05 12:42:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegoldsuite For sure. Systems are my backbone.

1544300555580805120 2022-07-05 12:41:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge You too, man. Your growth is wild.
1544300193427898370 2022-07-05 12:40:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sahilkhosla How often are you writing threads?
1544298770896232448 2022-07-05 12:34:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe For sure. That's how I met you. Get social out there...
1544298327117860864 2022-07-05 12:33:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imrane_dessai Keep going, Imrane!
1544298289549508614 2022-07-05 12:32:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sahiljamkhedkr_ Thanks, Sahil!
1544298213880070145 2022-07-05 12:32:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FlorianMielke I don't really use them that frequently. I use @blackmagic_so to respond to my favorite people.
1544297622957182976 2022-07-05 12:30:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @colby_ch 45 minutes in the morning normally.  Then maybe 15 minutes later today.  That's about it.
1544297256458895363 2022-07-05 12:28:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Anyone, anywhere, anytime.  I have 1,000+ pieces of content working on my behalf in the universe at all times.  Pretty wild.

I'll give Chirr a look though. Thanks, Jack!
1544296386614673409 2022-07-05 12:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ For sure. It's social media...might as well treat it as such.
1544295529542205441 2022-07-05 12:22:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Thanks!

1544295004130140160 2022-07-05 12:19:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @heykahn @aaditsh @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup @hypefury @TwemexApp @typeshare_co @TwitterBlue I'm not super familiar with Chirr. Worth a look?
1544294823192137729 2022-07-05 12:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni For sure, Kurtis.
1544294807039787008 2022-07-05 12:19:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rychieverse Yep. Learn one first, then add on.
1544294763607855105 2022-07-05 12:18:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii That's right, man. Consistency trumps most.
1544294664936869891 2022-07-05 12:18:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Same, Nick. Pretty wild.
1544294635459198976 2022-07-05 12:18:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thanks, man. Gotta build the habit muscle first.
1544293647688126464 2022-07-05 12:14:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @heykahn @aaditsh @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup @hypefury @TwemexApp @typeshare_co @TwitterBlue That's a wrap!

TL;DR  1/ Built publishing habit in the AM 2/ Educated my audience each PM 3/ A step-by-step thread once weekly 4/ Engage with 5-8 people in my niche each week 5/ Commented underneath large accounts 6/ Eliminated what wasn't working 7/ Setup inspiration tools
1544293637168717825 2022-07-05 12:14:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @heykahn @aaditsh @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup Improved my "inspiration" swipe file:  Writing a lot of Tweets means constantly being inspired.  Here are the tools I use to find that inspiration:  @hypefury (Tweet templates) @TwemexApp(User's best Tweets) @typeshare_co (Thread templates) @TwitterBlue (bookmark fave Tweets)
1544293627962220544 2022-07-05 12:14:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom @Nicolascole77 @thedankoe @dickiebush @heykahn @aaditsh @wes_kao @blakeaburge @sweatystartup Eliminated the "touch base" Tweets:  After 90 days, I had a publishing habit.  So I stopped the daily, "Happy Weekday" AM posts.  They weren't adding much value.  I started writing entertaining content or 2x'ing educational Tweets.   https://t.co/zRuGfCGl3p

1544293573981528064 2022-07-05 12:14:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Engage with 6-10 interesting people each week:  Make it a habit to build connections.  Here are some smart folks I've chatted with, just to jam out:  @SahilBloom  @Nicolascole77 @TheDanKoe @dickiebush @heykahn  @aaditsh @wes_kao @blakeaburge  @sweatystartup   It's "social" media.

1543936190088372224 2022-07-04 12:34:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel For sure. Like anything, a little practice works wonders.

1543615192067710983 2022-07-03 15:18:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Because a lot of books I've read should just be Tweets 😆
1543615039873196034 2022-07-03 15:17:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Wonderful thread, Aadit.  Audience building is more than great content.  It's an aggregation of intentional plays that build trust and deepen relationships.  Well done.
1543614525529800704 2022-07-03 15:15:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo You don't even need a laptop at all to make money online.   Ain't that crazy?
1543601433194414082 2022-07-03 14:23:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Thank you, Dan. Means a lot coming from you, man. Appreciate it.

1543595390435573764 2022-07-03 13:59:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis I have to or else I get all over the map!

1543577320350535680 2022-07-03 12:48:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @readershubham @AlexAndBooks_ Thank you!
1543575125362196484 2022-07-03 12:39:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour That's probably a better way to say it :)

1543574465895960578 2022-07-03 12:36:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ms_aegas Ha. I DID write this on LinkedIn in November of 2021, just to be clear.  https://t.co/1gCimdjISy
1543241701539594245 2022-07-02 14:34:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Life gets easier once you realize the entrepreneurs you admire are just like you.  A more consistent, curious, &amp; less risk-averse version of you.  So, if you want to join them, you only have 2 options:  A: Get started. B: Don't.  Option A is scary, but option B is scarier.
1543222531850752003 2022-07-02 13:18:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mauriciosampaio Basically.
1543222510405165058 2022-07-02 13:18:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje For sure it is, Sachin.

1543220832360701953 2022-07-02 13:11:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yoursilverlight @thedavelyman Crypto (of course)
1543219482520322050 2022-07-02 13:06:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedavelyman Thanks. There are about 10 of them now, so I've stopped trying.
1543218949114019841 2022-07-02 13:04:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CopySpell It sure is.
1543218902854942720 2022-07-02 13:03:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @3PillarsParent Lol

1543217548421992450 2022-07-02 12:58:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco I love that, Henry.
1543217521914007553 2022-07-02 12:58:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ayiyi_Daniel01 It certainly does.
1543217503152885765 2022-07-02 12:58:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yoursilverlight Try Building a Storybrand to start.
1543216315850178560 2022-07-02 12:53:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Saturday to entrepreneurs who realize psychology is just as important as marketing.
1543202295294443520 2022-07-02 11:57:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge I need a Zapier thread with your favorites.

1542892592261697542 2022-07-01 15:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Instead of answering generic questions, show the company that you know how to solve problems that are relevant to the business.
1542892453824438275 2022-07-01 15:26:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe People tend to project their own insecurities as facts.

1542891824691429377 2022-07-01 15:24:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup There is no faster way to grow as a person, or inside of a business, than by being solutions-oriented.
1542852206361296910 2022-07-01 12:46:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @litwin_sonia Awesome. See you tomorrow, Sonia!

1542847241488064513 2022-07-01 12:27:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Definitely a good Matrix. I think it's a bit high-level and misses automation and simplification.
1542844999049650176 2022-07-01 12:18:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artkulak Lots of people set goals and then work on things that don't actually help you reach them.

1542580473775415305 2022-06-30 18:46:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Shining the light on what you're learning helps attract other people who are doing the same.  Once that network grows, it's really, really difficult to fail.
1542580208628367360 2022-06-30 18:45:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Share the information you wish you had on your journey 2-3 years ago.

1542556191871705090 2022-06-30 17:10:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heychazza @dickiebush I have them staggered over time.
1542556139874836485 2022-06-30 17:10:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @anthonyserino_ Comment valuable things underneath large accounts.
1542556047637889026 2022-06-30 17:09:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jim_Keenan Haha. Thank you, man.
1542555725309911040 2022-06-30 17:08:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Thank you, my man. I appreciate the love.
1542555656833605635 2022-06-30 17:08:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @persuadingcopy None of those things.

1542555181031849986 2022-06-30 17:06:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamemmaoconnell Kajabi! And thanks.
1542538991085539328 2022-06-30 16:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're struggling to produce written content:  - Start writing your piece - Take a break for 30 - Come back - Cut 30% - Edit it - Post  Process, not perfection.
1542529147980972034 2022-06-30 15:23:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This is every Monday from 10:15a until 3p for me.   I create:  - 1 newsletter - 1 Twitter thread - 5 LinkedIn posts - 5 Tweets - 5 Instagram posts - 1 LinkedIn carousel - 1 Instagram story  Work week complete.
1542494082378899456 2022-06-30 13:03:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @AlexLlullTW Looking fwd to reading it, Dylan!
1542492544231161857 2022-06-30 12:57:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexaom6_ Right when I started it.
1542492486328881152 2022-06-30 12:57:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Yannick_Veys This is awesome, man. Thanks for featuring me.  Been loving @hypefury so much. Keep the features comin'!
1542492233605287936 2022-06-30 12:56:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theactionpod Yep - it will go down as you grow (probably!) but I've heard anything over 45% is good. So nice work!
1542492128034656257 2022-06-30 12:55:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Thank you so much, Greg. Get after it, man!

1542487170988097540 2022-06-30 12:36:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @that_niyi Appreciate that!
1542485328916877312 2022-06-30 12:28:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MantaisMoney Just to be clear, be clear.
1542485288215363584 2022-06-30 12:28:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copynishantraj Thank you, Nishant!

1542481605184348160 2022-06-30 12:14:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My newsletter has a ~62% open rate.  At 31k+ subscribers, that seems good.  Here are 4 simple tips I learned publishing for 25 weeks:  1. Clearly define who it's for 2. Clearly define what they'll get 3. Clearly define when they'll get it 4. And keep it short! (less than 5 min.)
1542295500577202176 2022-06-29 23:54:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Benjamin Buttons stuff here.   You both look 17.   Making it difficult on us 40 year olds. Please start aging.
1542264820770263040 2022-06-29 21:52:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyflus Nailed it.
1542264543535054848 2022-06-29 21:51:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EmailAssets That's exactly it, Pedro.
1542178487045394432 2022-06-29 16:09:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmAnasAmrani I like that.
1542178465927118848 2022-06-29 16:09:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mostpopul Good call.
1542178444267720706 2022-06-29 16:09:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nkornel For sure.
1542178421278752772 2022-06-29 16:09:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Too many people think I have the answers, when I am, in fact, not their customer.
1542176604465631233 2022-06-29 16:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Struggling as a solopreneur?  Don't: Focus on technology Do: Focus on customer problems  Don't: Build a coaching business or course Do: Build an audience around one topic  Don't: Ask popular social media accounts what to do Do: Ask your prospective customers what to do
1542164224654413824 2022-06-29 15:12:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh The #1 thing I see that stops people is "knowledge blindness".  They are blind to the valuable knowledge they have because they believe everyone else knows what they know.  They don't.  Share what you learn on your journey and those behind you will thank you.
1542163907065925633 2022-06-29 15:11:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Learning to write + scalable systems = incredible consistency.  And with consistency comes growth. Congrats, man.
1542134530395541506 2022-06-29 13:14:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Appreciate making the team.  I got cut from Varsity basketball, so this is long overdue.
1542129893760286721 2022-06-29 12:56:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom For sure.   But even those building paths outside of audience, community, and distribution still reap massive rewards via exposure - agree?
1542129309850157057 2022-06-29 12:54:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Ha. Trying. Glad to hear it's resonating.
1542128851744079872 2022-06-29 12:52:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I often hear "Most Blog posts should be Tweets."  This is a perfect example. You captured nearly everything needed to start a business in 2022 in less than 280 characters.  Good on ya.
1542128583350558721 2022-06-29 12:51:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe How to send 1,000 salespeople into the ecosystem while you do deep work:   - Log on to social media - Post something helpful - Log off

1542119214525435907 2022-06-29 12:14:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The smartest people I know are building leverage by focusing nearly 100% on audience, community, and distribution in 2022.

1541839014218563586 2022-06-28 17:40:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom We all believe that people know what we know.  A terrible assumption.

1541833974888235008 2022-06-28 17:20:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendan_aronson @sparktoro Welcome!
1541832218359767040 2022-06-28 17:13:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets 100%. Everyone has this fallacy.  It's about remembering that your knowledge is valuable to those who don't have it.
1541831827656253440 2022-06-28 17:12:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessekoepkecuts @sparktoro Love that, Jesse!

1541828371629342720 2022-06-28 16:58:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad Get started.   ↑ That's the KEY.  Make your first move today and start working this process.

1541828369532293123 2022-06-28 16:58:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad 10/ Set up your systems  - Create useful content - Drive people to the product - Upsell 1:1 coaching packages  With this simple system it's only a matter of time before you add a 3rd income stream:  - Consulting - Community - Physical products - Cohort-based coaching  Next?
1541828365593755652 2022-06-28 16:58:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad 9/ Raise your rates  With a lower-priced product, you can now increase your coaching rates.  When people want coaching, you can coach.  When they don't, tell them about your digital product.  You now have an offering for different learning styles and price points.
1541828363140190209 2022-06-28 16:58:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad 8/ Build a digital product  Your 2nd income stream is your 1st digital product. Focused on the most common problem above.  Take someone from problem to solution in 60 minutes or less.  Keep it focused.  Single problem → single solution  Price it reasonably to build trust.
1541828360317403137 2022-06-28 16:58:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad 7/ Listen for commonalities  This is a key step to creating your 2nd income stream.  Your goal when coaching is to listen for the most common problems of your students.  - Write down every problem you hear - Dive deeper to understand them - Keep a running list  This is the gold.
1541828358358589441 2022-06-28 16:58:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad 6/ Promote it  It's unlikely you'll get clients just because you exist.  Instead, find easy ways to promote it.  When your new followers ask you questions, tell them about your coaching business.  When you write content, share a link at the end.  Super simple stuff.
1541828356425105410 2022-06-28 16:58:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro 5/ Create a service business  A simple coaching business can be your 1st income stream.  An MVP landing page + @stripe or @gumroad to collect payments.  The key? Make the pricing a no-brainer.  You're not looking to get rich here, you're looking to learn.   (more on this)
1541828351471624193 2022-06-28 16:58:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Find the "you" from 2-3 years ago  Your goal is to find people who are just like you, but much earlier in their journey.  Where do they hang out online? Try places like:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - FB Groups  If you can't find them, use tools like @sparktoro to help.
1541828348187480071 2022-06-28 16:58:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Identify your interests  Inside of the list you just created, will be things you loved doing &amp; hated doing.  Sorry, but you can't scale being miserable.  Choose something you built skills in, that you also enjoy doing/talking about/writing about.  This will be your focus.
1541828345792499715 2022-06-28 16:58:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Eliminate the "fallacy of expertise"  When you get started, don't worry about "am I an expert?"  If you do, you'll never get started.  Instead, make a list of your accomplishments, big and small, over the last 2-3 years.  What skills did you learn during this period?
1541828342420316160 2022-06-28 16:58:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've now built 2 of my 5 income streams past 7-figures.  1. My coaching business 2. My digital products business  And I never wrote a single line of code.  Use these 10 dead-simple steps to do the same (without all of the mistakes):  🧵
1541820767301664771 2022-06-28 16:28:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Excellent thread, Alex. Thanks for including me. Just bookmarked this!
1541819549187719169 2022-06-28 16:23:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Add copywriting and marketing and then use all of these tools to automate your new content engine. Powerful!

1541790788719443972 2022-06-28 14:29:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Damn.   Haven't bookmarked something this fast in a while. Nice encapsulation of timeless writing techniques. Will revisit later.  Thanks, Cole.
1541768625383788544 2022-06-28 13:00:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @girdley @AdamSinger Haha 😂
1541768271317372929 2022-06-28 12:59:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe People love to hate selling without realizing that every action they take is because they've been sold.
1541759968046612485 2022-06-28 12:26:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Same thing here...
1541759942948003843 2022-06-28 12:26:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artkulak That's exactly it, Art.
1541759876518535168 2022-06-28 12:26:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue For sure. But going viral is rarely the way to do that.
1541759778006917120 2022-06-28 12:25:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sarvamwriter Thanks, Sarvam.
1541759709941727238 2022-06-28 12:25:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bbourque For sure. But it's worth it.
1541759140309225472 2022-06-28 12:23:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imjoshcousins Great thread, Josh. Thanks for the shout!
1541758933349666822 2022-06-28 12:22:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NoCodeCreative @blackmagic_so
1541757636131143684 2022-06-28 12:17:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JustinWise @OneJKMolina Both smart sayings...
1541757581990969344 2022-06-28 12:17:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mike_frederick Wouldn't that be interesting?
1541757538030567426 2022-06-28 12:16:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luqmanshantal For sure, Luqman.
1541757504723484673 2022-06-28 12:16:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Piyushscopy That's exactly it.
1541757468224651265 2022-06-28 12:16:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Absolutely, Daren.  Looking fwd to our spaces today!
1541562581957189632 2022-06-27 23:22:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelsklar Thank you!
1541554159954059265 2022-06-27 22:48:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This is an absolutely fabulous thread about copywriting.
1541553608747106310 2022-06-27 22:46:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelsklar This is super awesome, Michael.  Thanks for featuring me! I greatly appreciate it.

1541521532660350977 2022-06-27 20:39:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writes_eve If people laugh at me for joining a conversation, then they probably aren't people I want to spend time interacting with.
1541503931863506956 2022-06-27 19:29:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic 100%, Zlatko.
1541503499221045249 2022-06-27 19:27:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HenryMental Exactly. It's not even hard. It's just fun.
1541503036664823808 2022-06-27 19:25:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Carve out 15-20 minutes per day to reply to people.  - Easy exposure - More profile clicks - Better relationships  173,500 impressions in one week.  The time:impact ratio makes this a no-brainer.  https://t.co/EZ8VELAdKB
1541501859432730626 2022-06-27 19:20:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Every good thing looks like a scam to those who don't spend the time to understand it.
1541485631502794755 2022-06-27 18:16:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Prateek03883386 Definitely.  Everything is rigged.  The question is just, "Ok...now what?"
1541485273200181248 2022-06-27 18:15:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo @mariepoulin @AliAbdaal Wow. So honored to know this, Easlo. Greatly appreciate it, my man.  Keep going. You have the brightest future...
1541471351176941568 2022-06-27 17:19:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @calebmkeller Almost entirely organic.
1541471313235173378 2022-06-27 17:19:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulineRiviere My fave.
1541471294662778880 2022-06-27 17:19:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SujitDevkar Put up an away message that links to your coaching calls.
1541471239025344513 2022-06-27 17:19:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Edwindoit Absolutely.
1541471203658956802 2022-06-27 17:19:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets @iamwillcannon Just bookmarked this to read later. Thanks!
1541471147706949634 2022-06-27 17:18:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artkulak For sure, Art.
1541471104577032198 2022-06-27 17:18:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour Same.  I've never formed a solid relationship because someone has cold DM'ed me all of their life questions without an established relationship.
1541470983017701378 2022-06-27 17:18:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Piyushscopy For sure. But, if you're going to make the ask, follow these rules.
1541467179123703808 2022-06-27 17:03:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Networking 101  When you reach out to busy people, assume you are 1 of 1,000+ people asking for their time.  - Differentiate yourself. - Make your ask mutually beneficial. - Make it really, really easy to say yes.  Do these 3 things and you'll network more productively.
1541458295667494912 2022-06-27 16:27:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Thank you so much, man! Much appreciated 💪
1541445183077814274 2022-06-27 15:35:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mike_frederick @dickiebush @googleanalytics Thanks, Michael!
1541444910422818817 2022-06-27 15:34:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush One of mine as well. The first 7 years of my career I blamed my failures on everyone but myself.
1541404417328553985 2022-06-27 12:53:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe I love that.  I'm an optimist by nature, so this is just how I think.   "This can definitely be solved. I don't know how yet, but it can be."
1541404180761513986 2022-06-27 12:52:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush It's why "quality over quantity" is a phrase the needs more context.  In the beginning, it's all about quantity. Put a lot of stuff out and then hone in on what worked.   Do more of that and quality becomes inevitable.
1541403837285662723 2022-06-27 12:51:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe They are much more likely to tell you that you cannot achieve things (because they haven't).
1541403356924616705 2022-06-27 12:49:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel For sure! We all have self-doubt.  It's just remembering that we're gonna make it.
1541402719902220291 2022-06-27 12:47:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blairmacgregor That's for sure true, Blair.
1541402663295795201 2022-06-27 12:46:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hastakshar For sure, Shweta.
1541402634342612994 2022-06-27 12:46:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyforcreators @galjudo Glad to see you shifted!
1541402370319568898 2022-06-27 12:45:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew I do this as well. I have a mantra I say each morning. Feels weird, but also seems to work.
1541401775114166272 2022-06-27 12:43:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steven_Nelemans The optimist talking
1541401300079878144 2022-06-27 12:41:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Nailed it, Easlo.
1541400310068961280 2022-06-27 12:37:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Accountability is key. It's the best way to grow internally, and therefore externally.
1541398863109652480 2022-06-27 12:31:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BuzzRobTaylor That's exactly it, Rob. It can be hard, but oh so worth it.
1541398760273625090 2022-06-27 12:31:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EncoreAfrica True story.
1541398731928502277 2022-06-27 12:31:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @The_Klapz_Guy I love it, Satya.
1541398705449885699 2022-06-27 12:31:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artkulak I agree. Optimists rule the world.
1541398657064370184 2022-06-27 12:30:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue For sure, Sean. I love that.
1541398591205478400 2022-06-27 12:30:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisrickard I love this, Chris.
1541398545261072384 2022-06-27 12:30:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Piyushscopy It really is.
1541398021728079872 2022-06-27 12:28:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's spot on, Dhruv.
1541397990727983104 2022-06-27 12:28:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StoicSelf That's how I feel.
1541397965566246918 2022-06-27 12:28:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MahimaJalan2 Always, Mahima.
1541397942103416845 2022-06-27 12:28:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsedaxe 100%, Ed.
1541397458340782081 2022-06-27 12:26:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every successful person I know believes in themself.  Every unsuccessful person I know believes everything is rigged.  It's cliché as hell, but mindset matters.
1541094623963144194 2022-06-26 16:22:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Glad you enjoyed the issue, Max!
1541050172716769280 2022-06-26 13:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your mindset changes when you make $1 online.  Anything becomes possible. But how do you start?  Yesterday, 30,127 people learned the strategy and tactics.  Miss the issue?  Grab it below ↓   https://t.co/2MgaN9ft9X
1540724855141695488 2022-06-25 15:53:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CooperKraussKC Thank you, Cooper!
1540692727569928193 2022-06-25 13:45:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @compoundthat It definitely is. I love that.
1540692662063435776 2022-06-25 13:45:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sohaibgadiwala That's exactly it, Sohaib.
1540692634649481216 2022-06-25 13:45:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichaelJNovotny That generally comes from having too few customer/prospect conversations.
1540692553766420481 2022-06-25 13:45:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JarvisKa I've done it for sure.
1540692526457229320 2022-06-25 13:44:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jamesbrackiniv Great question to ask yourself, James.
1540692437475028996 2022-06-25 13:44:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YongYuYY Yet so often skipped.
1540692379447005184 2022-06-25 13:44:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sunilc_ For sure, Sunil.
1540692268545241091 2022-06-25 13:43:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Correct. And they often get it wrong.
1540692233967394816 2022-06-25 13:43:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki 100%, man. This is what led to both of my info products so far.
1540692159950495745 2022-06-25 13:43:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @3PillarsParent We just have to validate that people will pay for them.
1540692119370743808 2022-06-25 13:43:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artkulak Yes, I should have probably put solution in quotes
1540692071178088457 2022-06-25 13:43:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steven_Nelemans That's where the money is!
1540692022922620928 2022-06-25 13:42:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Emilio_emb It's also an endeavor based on being very close to, and speaking frequently with, your customer. Which so many people skip.
1540691908640620544 2022-06-25 13:42:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis For sure. Only really painful problems get you paid.
1540687032481103873 2022-06-25 13:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Many solopreneurs building a solution don't even understand the problem.
1540670300060262400 2022-06-25 12:16:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge My wife and I do our weekly finance meeting each Saturday morning in Excel, so this was really timely.  Appreciate these, man.
1540664664912236544 2022-06-25 11:54:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendan_aronson Shield Analytics.

1540320889660706816 2022-06-24 13:08:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Love this quote.  Every Monday, I coincidentally am inspired to write my entire newsletter.  Every Tuesday? 10 piece of content.  Weird, huh?
1540320724623265792 2022-06-24 13:07:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Damn.  That's absolutely prolific output, Cole.  Congrats.
1540320633418047490 2022-06-24 13:07:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe This is spot on.   Always be up-skilling, because in the blink of an eye, you realize you're less relevant than you used to be.
1540320439788093441 2022-06-24 13:06:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Then hire people who understand their specialty deeply and let them do their thing, all while holding them accountable to the agreed upon KPIs.
1540320146652368901 2022-06-24 13:05:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Feel better, Daniel. Get well soon!

1540002726012231683 2022-06-23 16:03:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisrickard That's my goal, Chris!
1540002314223853568 2022-06-23 16:02:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> After tinkering around with an idea for months, I decided to just take some action.   Accomplished more in 2 focused hours than in 30 days of wondering.   Reminder to self: Just. Get. Started.
1539991878527062016 2022-06-23 15:20:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Becoming auto-didactic is a cheat code for life.
1539991746922307584 2022-06-23 15:20:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh And copy. Learn to write in a way that people can easily digest and enjoy.  That's rocket fuel.
1539991638189260800 2022-06-23 15:19:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki One of these things is not like the other...
1539991550280753154 2022-06-23 15:19:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Congrats, Easlo!
1539991426276139009 2022-06-23 15:19:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Nearly everything in school is about memorization and regurgitation.  Nearly everything in the real-world is about problem solving.  It's why most Valedictorians are no more successful than the rest of their classmates.
1539983753082277888 2022-06-23 14:48:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Great thread, man.  The best tip I got from you was write and edit at different times.  I started by doing both at once, and my long-form has improved significantly with that advice.
1539953787015729153 2022-06-23 12:49:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe So true, man.   Your content is a huge army going out 1 by 1 and capturing attention, luck, and interest every day.   Start building it and add to it daily.
1539951888489136135 2022-06-23 12:41:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Maybe it is ;-)
1539950707943645186 2022-06-23 12:37:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Good stuff, Manjhunath!
1539950667590164480 2022-06-23 12:37:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew I love that approach, Kieran.
1539950627350003713 2022-06-23 12:36:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Many people start building a solution to a problem they don't even understand yet.  You're nailing it here, Andrew.
1539950534462955524 2022-06-23 12:36:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bhallcpa That's a good one, Brandon.
1539950498341687296 2022-06-23 12:36:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Many build solutions before they even understand the problem.
1539948526817476609 2022-06-23 12:28:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FlorianMielke Love this, Florian.
1539948483351830535 2022-06-23 12:28:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets That's exactly it.
1539948455602397191 2022-06-23 12:28:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisrickard Yep.  Most MVPs can be a landing page and Calendly or Stripe.
1539948168342904834 2022-06-23 12:27:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stanrym I agree that's one powerful way.
1539948123430309890 2022-06-23 12:26:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianFOConnor I see a lot of people buying up hundreds of dollars worth of monthly tech and they haven't made $1 yet.
1539947527453216770 2022-06-23 12:24:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamsimm0 I'm putting something together at the moment to share what I've been doing. Works extremely, extremely well, IMO.
1539947174171123712 2022-06-23 12:23:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanisRenaud It depends. #4 is big for so many people I talk to.   But I definitely see all 4.
1539946403069411328 2022-06-23 12:20:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurs generally struggle with 1 of 4 challenges:  - They don’t fully understand customer's problems - They don’t capture interested prospects - They overcomplicate the technology - They have no online audience  Review these and create a simple plan for each.
1539920862203318272 2022-06-23 10:38:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DenisJeliazkov @MilaChervenkova Thank you both!

1539744748075884544 2022-06-22 22:58:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CooperKraussKC I'd say find a company that allows you to use your personal social media 😀  Then, build out a brand that gives you leverage so you never find yourself in that position again.
1539712543098372096 2022-06-22 20:50:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby @amandanat I think this will be in addition to threads. Looks like a great way to build more trust by showing deep expertise without leaving the platform.  Sort of moving to an all-in-one publishing tool.
1539642820168151040 2022-06-22 16:13:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pupeno I agree. I think it's ridiculous. That's why I would never work for a company with an agreement like that.  Build some leverage and you have the same optionality.
1539642657416282112 2022-06-22 16:13:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yekeen_ayodele I think that's true.
1539642614588268544 2022-06-22 16:12:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @InTake_Anthony That last line is basically what I was trying to convey. You did a better job.
1539642441585889280 2022-06-22 16:12:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pupeno Sure, but many of these (not all) prohibit competitive side projects.  For those that have more iron-clad legal docs, it could be much toughee.
1539642188065382402 2022-06-22 16:11:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ericasmyname It's not easy. But it's possible.  It's just a matter of priorities and some people (rightly so) have different priorities which I completely respect.
1539642053314748416 2022-06-22 16:10:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv I think so too, Dhrv.
1539642017810382848 2022-06-22 16:10:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JesseGerniginAC 100%. This is the easiest, IMO.
1539641976114802689 2022-06-22 16:10:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_baillee For sure. Most great things aren't very easy. It's about balance and not feeling urgency, but taking it one step at a time.
1539639886046810114 2022-06-22 16:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Even if you’re employed full-time you can still:  - Consult - Freelance - Write eBooks - Create video courses - Write a paid newsletter - Do cohort-based coaching  The barrier to entry has never been lower.  The potential to replace your salary has never been higher.
1539597211025248257 2022-06-22 13:12:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @creation247 So many people think it's about the dollar when it's really about the mindset shift.
1539596981710061569 2022-06-22 13:11:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo I read this as I was looking at my fitness habit tracker. Just ruined my morning 😂
1539596826571055107 2022-06-22 13:11:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Keep it going:   - 5 observations during that time - 5 things people get wrong about solving it - 5 ways solving this will change in the future - 5 tools or techniques that made solving it easy
1539596528444137472 2022-06-22 13:09:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Thank you for saying this.  The most common questions I get are:   - What time? - What tech? - How many?  None of it matters if you don't understand who you are serving, why you are serving them, and what you're helping them do.
1539596035483369473 2022-06-22 13:07:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak The best way to be interesting online is to be interesting offline.
1539595811331477505 2022-06-22 13:07:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki This translates to almost anything we do, which is why it's so important.  If everything you create is only for yourself, you miss an incredible opportunity to help others.  That's how you build a brand, audience, business, etc.
1539590399697866755 2022-06-22 12:45:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe That's right.   It's like trying to viral.   It's basically meaningless unless your message is hitting your exact ICP.
1539590059032297473 2022-06-22 12:44:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Yep! A huge confidence booster in every way.
1539589225640824832 2022-06-22 12:40:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ I appreciate that man ❤️
1539588744495374336 2022-06-22 12:38:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Great thread, Matt! Thanks for the shoutout :)
1539588407655006209 2022-06-22 12:37:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blairmacgregor It absolutely is. You're right, Blair.
1539588361043820549 2022-06-22 12:37:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FCKlas Exactly. Great advice, Christian.
1539588290688557056 2022-06-22 12:37:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @polak_jasper Aim big, start small.
1539588252792983552 2022-06-22 12:36:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hritikrajdm Nailed it.
1539586428518146050 2022-06-22 12:29:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coachgmuncy I sold a course for $50 in 2019 based on what I had learned writing online.
1539586350734868480 2022-06-22 12:29:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HiSanchoman Get that first dollar and $1B doesn't seem all that crazy ;-)
1539586250704920581 2022-06-22 12:29:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heywarco That's exactly it. I made $50 in 2019. I was hooked.
1539586187618304000 2022-06-22 12:28:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD You can't make $1M if you can't make $1.
1539586136871403527 2022-06-22 12:28:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets And it's just the beginning. It's a mindset shift, and it makes every other dollar easier.
1539585889210335232 2022-06-22 12:27:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_The_Silk_Road That's right. The key to success right there.
1539585824836157441 2022-06-22 12:27:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Billionaire_CL It's a marathon.
1539585804674236416 2022-06-22 12:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt A marathon is made of many steps.
1539585762261454849 2022-06-22 12:27:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aIIegoricaI I love that sentiment.
1539585721568313344 2022-06-22 12:26:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanbozarth_ Just getting started is the best thing you can do. Then analyze, iterate, and try again.
1539585609798385670 2022-06-22 12:26:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's exactly it, Dhruv. Start small, learn to compound over time.
1539585556711104516 2022-06-22 12:26:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 I'm still working on my systems to continue to grow slowly and intelligently.
1539584771243884546 2022-06-22 12:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> An observation about solopreneurs on Twitter:  Many struggle to make $1 online because they are focused on how to make $1M online.  Making $1 will change the way you think.  Start small, not grandiose.
1539404279538147328 2022-06-22 00:25:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KateBour External, internal, relationships, debates, negotiations.   Lots and lots of marketing.   It’s why the skill set is so powerful.
1539394062255640576 2022-06-21 23:45:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dbustac @OscarLagrosen Thank you fellas!
1539383010809860099 2022-06-21 23:01:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush  https://t.co/H6O7LzWlqu   It’s the playbook every Twitter power user has bought to come over and explode on LinkedIn.
1539307192704282624 2022-06-21 18:00:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_anthonydisney Thanks for the kind shout, Anthony!
1539290682032005122 2022-06-21 16:54:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tylersmith_io Why we have the world we do today.
1539290630089846784 2022-06-21 16:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zolfagariMD Of course. That should go without saying.  I don't put up with any of that stuff.
1539290533608161281 2022-06-21 16:53:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshFromCMG True story, Joshua.
1539290492227158016 2022-06-21 16:53:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artkulak Absolutely, Art.
1539290459968782338 2022-06-21 16:53:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matt_Throne I understand that for sure. It's generally true that most points of view have some merit (not all)
1539290343241302016 2022-06-21 16:53:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 Same. Just listen and empathize.
1539290311679168512 2022-06-21 16:53:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CalvertKyam Thanks, Kyam.
1539290280586792960 2022-06-21 16:52:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eitan_levy101 For sure. It's a great skill to have.
1539290246529032192 2022-06-21 16:52:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_baillee Would improve the entire world.
1539288068775194624 2022-06-21 16:44:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One of the clearest signs of intelligence is being interested in other people’s perspectives.   95% of people I meet aren’t.   Crazy.
1539268945575919624 2022-06-21 15:28:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Super interesting. I need to dive deeper into this, Cole.  Anyone doing a good job of this?
1539266877989560320 2022-06-21 15:19:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AugustBradley @blakeaburge @Julian @SahilBloom @dickiebush Thank you so much!
1539266841268346882 2022-06-21 15:19:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coachgmuncy That's so true, Gabby.
1539266726843535363 2022-06-21 15:19:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @claudio_fray Of the total pop? No, I don't.
1539253309277716480 2022-06-21 14:26:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki I can also validate that it's one helluva book.  Congrats on all of your success, Andrew.
1539253175517073408 2022-06-21 14:25:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Anyone who is building a one-person business oughtta be subscribing to this.   Congrats on the launch, Easlo.
1539253026317381636 2022-06-21 14:24:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches These are all very smart, very simple (not easy) changes that lead to a 4x increase.  Cool part?  You can choose to make 4x more, or work 25% as much for the same amount.  Optionality.
1539252867449618435 2022-06-21 14:24:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Coach_Riad_ Ha. Figured someone would catch that.
1539252748352372738 2022-06-21 14:23:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 The most powerful!
1539231560934862848 2022-06-21 12:59:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kennysmithnanic Thanks for the kind mention, Kenny 🔥
1539227515528552449 2022-06-21 12:43:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets For sure!
1539227473161879553 2022-06-21 12:43:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andyfieb Keep talking about the same topic until you attract people who also want to talk about it.
1539224666895794176 2022-06-21 12:32:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ReturnToEmail Or share your thoughts via Twitter. Both excellent ways.
1539224600969719808 2022-06-21 12:31:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Chimzzar1 But others probably do.
1539224564454277121 2022-06-21 12:31:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TimdNerd For sure, Tim.

1539224419452715011 2022-06-21 12:31:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarketerHayden Thanks, Hayden.
1539224399081005056 2022-06-21 12:31:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BusinessEngines It's crazy to ignore the potential, IMO.
1539224357511249920 2022-06-21 12:30:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi For sure!
1539224322170036224 2022-06-21 12:30:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisrickard That's unfortunately true, I think, Chris.
1539224258429210627 2022-06-21 12:30:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shaynmtl Learn to consume from the best, and create using what you've learned.  Winner.
1539224193446858753 2022-06-21 12:30:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChaseArbeiter You're everywhere, Chase!
1539224141806682114 2022-06-21 12:30:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyforcreators This a great comment. I love it.
1539222134245019651 2022-06-21 12:22:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_Wisdom_Academy Haha. Easy.
1539222064254619648 2022-06-21 12:21:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theficouple Nice!
1539222043270516737 2022-06-21 12:21:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rachanashinde_ Keep going, Rachana.
1539221376040591360 2022-06-21 12:19:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The internet is like a convention where anyone can speak.  1% of people grab the mic, 9% of people actively listen, and 90% of people mill around talking shit about those on stage.  But, the stage is where business happens.  So, grab the mic and start talking.

1539005085505683458 2022-06-20 21:59:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Damn, these are good. Saved.

1538937786325139457 2022-06-20 17:32:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom That's awesome man. ❤️
1538937676702810114 2022-06-20 17:31:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh What I've found is that they are sort of inverse.  Early on, it's about hard work. That helps you increase the chances you meet important people, choose good projects, and therefore increase your luck.  Once you do that, hard work becomes a bit less important.
1538937299584565248 2022-06-20 17:30:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki average action-taker &gt; brilliant over-thinker

1538936388359430144 2022-06-20 17:26:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VicVijayakumar That's certainly one of the more difficult parts, Vic.

1538930506879860739 2022-06-20 17:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  Step 1: Avoid the top 4 killer thread mistakes Step 2: Write the body using headers and white space Step 3: Use a specific call to action to tell readers what to do. Step 4: Write compelling hook lines by using my recommendations.
1538930504845623296 2022-06-20 17:03:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Example 4: Get right to the point   https://t.co/6XEyJhLLQR
1538930502358470659 2022-06-20 17:03:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Example 3: Use juxtaposition (comparison)   https://t.co/0Q73LPwI00
1538930500194160640 2022-06-20 17:03:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Example 2: Use eye-catching numbers   https://t.co/ajS4ODrlb7
1538930498151538688 2022-06-20 17:03:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Example 1: Tell people what they'll get &amp; address an objection   https://t.co/yylDFpE9Co
1538930496016683009 2022-06-20 17:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Crafting a great "hook" Tweet  The most critically important step of writing Tweet threads is the "Hook" Tweet.  This is the first Tweet in your thread, and it makes or breaks your entire thread.  I've found there are 4 ways to open a killer Thread.  Here they are ↓
1538930492627636224 2022-06-20 17:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Add a great CTA  People write threads &amp; then forget to tell the reader what to do.  What a waste!  Here are some example CTA's:  - Follow you - Buy your product - Join your newsletter - Sign up for a live event - Read another thread you wrote  Check out this one from me:  https://t.co/j0jk0ghwVc
1538930479876939779 2022-06-20 17:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Use headers and white space  A header simply tells the reader what to expect in each Tweet they are reading.  White space is the space between lines so that it's easier on the eyes.  Don't use too much whitespace, but just enough to make it easy.  Here's an example of both:  https://t.co/DZnt0VqrXj
1538930469080907776 2022-06-20 17:03:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Start by writing the body  The body of the thread is the information you're attempting to convey.  It should add very specific value:  - Teach something step-by-step - Tell an interesting story - Share a framework - Dispel a myth  Stay away from nebulous observations.
1538930467021504513 2022-06-20 17:03:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Avoid thread mistakes  Here are the most common mistakes I see w/ threads:  - Lacking a good Hook Tweet - No headers on the body Tweets - Way too wordy, and no white space for reading - No clear call-to-action or call-to-conversation at the end  Here's how to fix these ↓
1538930464790020096 2022-06-20 17:03:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Here's what you'll learn by reading this:  1. Avoiding the biggest thread mistakes 2. How to write a great thread body 3. Using headers and white space 4. Writing a great CTA for the end 5. Establishing your "hook Tweet" 6. 3 killer openers  Let's dive in ↓

1538865270474825729 2022-06-20 12:44:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Hard to lose with this routine...
1538865116078387200 2022-06-20 12:43:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Understand why people make the decisions that they make, and you're already a better marketer than 90% of people.
1538864979188785152 2022-06-20 12:42:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom My therapist recommends that each morning you work yourself to exhaustion.  So, this morning, I'm going to go swim. I hate swimming. Let's see if this works.
1538864629992017920 2022-06-20 12:41:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe I needed to hear this today.  Time to hide and reemerge with some new stuff.

1538863497974521857 2022-06-20 12:37:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BuzzRobTaylor Same, Rob.
1538863479377076225 2022-06-20 12:36:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe This is so true.   1. Figure out what you know 2. Figure out who needs to know it 3. Figure out how to find them 4. Figure out how to distribute 5. Say your price and be quiet
1538863327555862533 2022-06-20 12:36:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets For sure. It's like you forget that you didn't know this stuff once...
1538860962857590785 2022-06-20 12:26:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jakevictor_ They almost never do.
1538860936722792448 2022-06-20 12:26:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adalbueno That's the truth, Adal.
1538860900353966081 2022-06-20 12:26:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @igorbenic Love that, Igor.
1538860862131388417 2022-06-20 12:26:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blairmacgregor That's right.  If it helps one person, it likely will help 100.
1538859297710424067 2022-06-20 12:20:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @navdeepsoni That's a good idea, Navdeep.
1538859263136829440 2022-06-20 12:20:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom 100%. Once I realized that my experience and knowledge was worth something to someone else, things started to clear up a bit.
1538859175941382145 2022-06-20 12:19:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Figuring out what you know that's valuable is that critical first step.  Once you know, it's time to figure out who needs it.
1538857710279659520 2022-06-20 12:14:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Something you think is obvious is worth $5,000+ to someone else.  Have a great week.

1538166740319870976 2022-06-18 14:28:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak This is 100% true.  When I used to hire salespeople at PatientPop, I never liked when they applied to be a salesperson, customer success rep, and marketing associate.  Be specific and know what you want.

1538165892990783489 2022-06-18 14:25:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Haha.  When people ask me what I do, I say: "Social media stuff."  I should probably get an elevator pitch.
1538165718499442690 2022-06-18 14:24:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Block the negative.  Consume the positive.  Create to give back to the latter.

1537783868031377408 2022-06-17 13:06:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Thanks, my man.
1537783868018810881 2022-06-17 13:06:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bhallcpa Kajabi for everything now.
1537783463918678016 2022-06-17 13:05:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Create your niche and be open to flexibility.   As you create your category you may find something even more interesting inside/adjacent to it.  Stay nimble.
1537783189376323586 2022-06-17 13:04:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe When you wake up at 430am on Monday morning excited to do work, you know you've found it...
1537783058622988290 2022-06-17 13:03:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Codie_Sanchez Lots of people are great at making money.   Growing it is another story. That's why they end up sacrificing their time over and over.  Learn to make and grow your money. That's when it becomes infinitely easier to recapture your time.
1537782666392641536 2022-06-17 13:02:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki The more customers you talk to, the more successful you'll become.  The more successful you become, the more investors will talk to you.  Win/Win.
1537781795499950080 2022-06-17 12:58:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Darrenmmatthews I look fwd to sending it, Darren.

1537779156196409344 2022-06-17 12:48:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj That's so kind of you to say, and so wonderful to hear, Louie. Thanks, man.

1537776569673994241 2022-06-17 12:37:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_anthonydisney Haha. I thought this was serious until I got to the end.
1537776501306937344 2022-06-17 12:37:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RajAyoosh Heck yeah! Thanks, man.
1537776428447588352 2022-06-17 12:37:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedavelyman Oh goodness. I hope you're joking.
1537775390521008129 2022-06-17 12:33:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedavelyman It's really the connect and pitches that bother me. I get lots here on Twitter too though.

In an attempt to build relationships, they destroy them.  - Generic outreach - A “me me” mentality - Providing zero mutual benefit  Tomorrow, I'll show 29,594 people how to do the opposite.

1537516004590469120 2022-06-16 19:22:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Perno Yes.  People can't figure out how to grow on social media or write high-quality content at scale.  My products solve that.

1537457189849374723 2022-06-16 15:28:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue No trigger. IMO, you should always be deepening trust in your expertise.

1537423217937235973 2022-06-16 13:13:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Coming from a sales leadership background, I know most "yes's" come from touch 8-12.
1537421675985346560 2022-06-16 13:07:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I prefer working on one thing at a time, but many things one after another.   Focus + diversification
1537421522981249025 2022-06-16 13:07:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 If you have talent, build systems.  Systems give you a better shot at consistency.  Nobody likes staring at a blank screen and just hoping...
1537421282412748805 2022-06-16 13:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki This was always my goal as CRO 😂
1537420677032058880 2022-06-16 13:03:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_ZionSpirit_ I'm not sure. It will depend on how good you get at it, what your offer is, if you listen to your customers, etc.  Lots of chance and luck at play, always.

1537411320911478784 2022-06-16 12:26:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisrickard Thank you, Chris!

1537411219602264070 2022-06-16 12:26:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Thank you, Dave!
1537411198974574593 2022-06-16 12:26:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Unbelievable.  I came across your site and info long before I ever made a single $ online.  It helped me feel like it was possible. Just thought you should know that.
1537410456243036160 2022-06-16 12:23:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @personalvipin Appreciate it, Vipin.
1537410411741466624 2022-06-16 12:23:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Thanks, Greg!
1537409740979982337 2022-06-16 12:20:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal Well...that's a wrap.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @thejustinwelsh for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1537409738715045888 2022-06-16 12:20:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 15/ Explore how to use community  1. Get feedback 2. Get beta testers 3. Build an affiliate program 4. Get your first testimonials 5. Presell with a great discount 6. Get support for your content  And so on.  Monetization is now MUCH easier.  It's on you to get creative!
1537409736680910848 2022-06-16 12:20:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 14/ Monetize  With a community of fans, monetization becomes a lot easier.  You basically have a "shopping mall". A captive audience.  People are looking to buy and you're the store owner.  No algorithm. No open rates. No friction.  Here are some things you can do:
1537409734579474432 2022-06-16 12:20:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 13/ Deepen Relationships  Once trust is built, you can build deep relationships.  Create a community to show a "behind-the-scenes" glimpse at how you think, act, &amp; work.  It's easier to invite someone in once they trust your expertise.  Build your community of fans.
1537409732444569600 2022-06-16 12:20:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @AliAbdaal 12/ Learn to "deplatform"  I started a newsletter because I wanted to "deplatform" my audience from social media to something I actually own:   An email address.  I've found this is the best way to guard against the unforeseen, like algorithm changes or being banned.  A must.
1537409730238418944 2022-06-16 12:20:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 11/ Leverage How-to videos  Don't like interviewing? Turn the camera around on yourself.  This is a great way to build trust by literally walking people through how to do something.  A master at this is @aliabdaal  Check out his channel below:   https://t.co/vmPDnMwknb
1537409727839227905 2022-06-16 12:20:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo 10/ Start a Podcast  If you don't want to write, start a podcast.  It shows your expertise, and you get the side benefit of connecting w/ interesting people.  Social proof!  Like how @dickiebush &amp; @nicolascole77 do it on the Ship30for30 podcast.   https://t.co/QU73NbUWQ0
1537409724496453632 2022-06-16 12:20:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo 9/ Write a newsletter  A newsletter is a great way to show your expertise.  Long-form allows you to go deeper &amp; more tactical in your lessons.  You're literally showing people how your brain works.  I do this weekly in The Saturday Solopreneur:   https://t.co/vCOnWlle21
1537409722453737477 2022-06-16 12:20:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo 8/ Build Trust  Once you get discovered, you must build a deeper level of trust.  Not trust in the traditional sense of the word, but trust in your expertise.  That you actually know what you're doing &amp; can back up what you talk about.  This is critical.  So how do you do that?
1537409714606247936 2022-06-16 12:20:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Learn to add value  All of these pieces of content are intended to "add value" to the reader.  It's a phrase that is used so often, but people rarely understand how to approach it.  But, it's not a mystery.   Here's my favorite way to describe it, from @dvassallo  https://t.co/cjALCCCtzp
1537409708268695552 2022-06-16 12:20:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Empathize  Some content reaches your audience &amp; says, "I understand what you're going through" or, "you're not alone".   This content draws your audience in closer &amp; greatly humanizes an otherwise inanimate social media profile.  Like this:   https://t.co/gbFgY8RqsL
1537409705257091072 2022-06-16 12:20:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Challenge people  Content that challenges perceptions should get the reaction:  "I've never thought of it like that before", or... "What an interesting observation" or just... "Damn."  Open people up to a new perspective and win.  Like this Tweet:   https://t.co/vpY4srYOHT
1537409702493036547 2022-06-16 12:20:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Be entertaining  Teaching is helpful, but if you hammer your audience with teachings 100% of the time, you run the risk of boring them.   If you bore them, you might get tuned out.   This is where entertainment comes in.  Like this Tweet:   https://t.co/W9KpStVnaa
1537409700274266112 2022-06-16 12:20:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Teach people (educate)  The easiest way to get discovered is by teaching prospective followers &amp; customers how to do something.  These are "tactical" Tweets and threads that show off a bit of your expertise.  Share your knowledge!  Like this:   https://t.co/zRuGfCGl3p
1537409697795428352 2022-06-16 12:20:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Get Discovered  If nobody finds your thoughts/ideas, nothing else matters.  You want to start by creating value where folks are already consuming.  - Twitter - LinkedIn - TikTok - Etc.  There are 4 ways to do this:  1. Educate 2. Entertain 3. Challenge 4. Empathize
1537409695194963968 2022-06-16 12:20:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Build a creator funnel  This is a simple journey your audience goes through, increasing the chance they become a customer at each step.  It has 4 key parts:  1. Discovery 2. Trust 3. Relationships 4. Monetization  The first part is getting discovered.
1537409692116439041 2022-06-16 12:20:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Here's what you'll learn in this thread:  1. Getting discovered 2. Content that works 3. What "adding value" really means 4. Moving from discovery → trust 5. Why "de-platforming" matters 6. The journey to deep relationships 7. Monetizing a captive audience  Let's dive in ↓
1537409684931547136 2022-06-16 12:20:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Back in 2019 I made $0 online.  3 years later:  - 175M+ impressions - $2.4M in online income - 5 successful revenue streams  Here are my 15 dead-simple principles for building online:

1537178930402054144 2022-06-15 21:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samthescot I do use it, yes.  Everyone is down. Just keep going. Things always normalize.
1537178882087997444 2022-06-15 21:02:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Yep! That's the best.  The support here is unreal.
1537139297190551553 2022-06-15 18:25:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaredablon Ain't that the truth.
1537139217314234368 2022-06-15 18:25:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CalvertKyam Thanks, Kyam!
1537139136003510272 2022-06-15 18:25:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spontaneousbkpk I don't :)
1537139067581865990 2022-06-15 18:24:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I've been tinkering for years and it still feels like I'm early in the game.   A lot of fun, way more learnings.
1537118386152427520 2022-06-15 17:02:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheWizardGal That’s why I love it.

1537117395566972929 2022-06-15 16:58:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @quote_luke Less than those telling lies.   That’s why I encourage everyone to be skeptical.
1537117012563984385 2022-06-15 16:57:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj I’m loving watching you. Just lurking over here excited by what you’re doing.
1537116886328037382 2022-06-15 16:56:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AroojAhmad This is awesome.
1537116806082711552 2022-06-15 16:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NextToWealth Right?
1537116775111876608 2022-06-15 16:56:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spontaneousbkpk I know. I can’t keep trying to bring ‘em down.
1537116518617694209 2022-06-15 16:55:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD This is 100% the truth, Tom.
1537116449470308354 2022-06-15 16:54:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KalimoLeboela This is excellent advice.
1537116267534073860 2022-06-15 16:54:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samthescot The cool part is that it still feels like I’m  screwing around.
1537115723247632384 2022-06-15 16:52:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JosephSeifert22 Yep. Walk a marathon if you have to.
1537115621053317120 2022-06-15 16:51:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @acor_mark Same, Mark.
1537115588081885188 2022-06-15 16:51:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Samuel4Christ Just keep putting yourself out there, Samuel.   Watch what works. Do more of it.  What what doesn't. Do less of it.  Then, just keep going.
1537115399380209664 2022-06-15 16:50:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe @afunnelguy @The1stReporter Tell me where and when.
1537115355126108176 2022-06-15 16:50:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsjustbri_yt I agree, Bri.  The amount of stuff you learn just doing it on your own...damn. Crazy.
1537114611958300673 2022-06-15 16:47:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've worked in executive leadership roles in startups that have raised $300M+ and generated $400M+ in revenue.  But I've never learned more than I'm learning now just screwing around trying to build my own thing on the internet.  Start a side project online.  You won't be sorry.
1537102838232453121 2022-06-15 16:00:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fab_rosato This is awesome, Fabio. Great job :)
1537094344347353088 2022-06-15 15:27:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @giannicara Appreciate that, man!
1537072163693514753 2022-06-15 13:58:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom For sure.  I try not to hate on anyone's style, but that just isn't mine (the first one).   I'm glad to see progress.
1537058096392065024 2022-06-15 13:03:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 The internet is like a stage that's open to anyone who wants to speak. 1% of people grab the mic, 9% of people actively listen, and 90% of people mill around the bar.
1537051798837551104 2022-06-15 12:38:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshdviner Pretty wild, huh?
1537051495006339072 2022-06-15 12:36:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichaelJNovotny @thedankoe 😂 I'm not even hating on their game. Good for them.  It's not my style, so I'm just glad to see the tide turning, ya know?
1537051333433475075 2022-06-15 12:36:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Great thread, Matt. Thanks for the kind mention, my man. 🔥
1537050903957626885 2022-06-15 12:34:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FinlinedFinance Thank you so much!
1537050865860845569 2022-06-15 12:34:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MatterCalm That's right!
1537050830955851777 2022-06-15 12:34:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylepdotco True story.
1537050812056326144 2022-06-15 12:34:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JosephSeifert22 I think you might be right, Joseph.
1537050649392734209 2022-06-15 12:33:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The same here, Dan. It's so refreshing to see it moving away from the old way and towards the new way.  I guess that's just the normal shift in anything new.
1537050011044827144 2022-06-15 12:30:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @baltunt Less and less, I think.
1537049984125870080 2022-06-15 12:30:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DougWoodrow I'm so glad. ha.
1537049928006094849 2022-06-15 12:30:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theob2brebel I think it will go away, tbh.
1537049884863373312 2022-06-15 12:30:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jdchernikoff Trying, Josh!
1537049834343043080 2022-06-15 12:30:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheRealUtaini These are becoming less and less, IMO, though. The internet doesn't take long to catch on to scams.

1536774097694244864 2022-06-14 18:14:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MeetKevon I feel like I spend an pretty exorbitant amount of time engaging across both LinkedIn and Twitter.   I’ve always tried to make this my differentiator.
1536754081573871617 2022-06-14 16:54:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DealGeekMe Awesome.
1536754081548619778 2022-06-14 16:54:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SyedHuq For sure. Overcoming the status quo is often the most challenging.
1536752374429229056 2022-06-14 16:48:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eitan_levy101 Great addition!

1536751355322327040 2022-06-14 16:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6 objections to handle when selling your product:  1. You don't understand my problem. 2. You don't have the expertise. 3. Does anyone else like this product? 4. Why is it priced this way? 5. How fast will it work? 6. Why should I buy now?  Write landing page copy to overcome.

1536701774211567616 2022-06-14 13:27:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Trademark that.
1536701731857473536 2022-06-14 13:26:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches It's generally the inverse.  I use copy I know will generate engagement to continue growing my prospect pool.  When it's time to sell, my posts get 70% less engagement but I make 10x the revenue.  Gotta have a balance. Great Tweet, man.
1536701476663345153 2022-06-14 13:25:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 That's a really great point, Cole.  I hadn't considered that when writing my response. Good call.

1536694339266654208 2022-06-14 12:57:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo It's a wonderful feeling to be able to shut anything down, start anything new, change something completely, or just do nothing.  And it requires zero explanation or (my least favorite) a lengthy business case.

1536684711229243394 2022-06-14 12:19:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  - Pain - Agitate - Intrigue - Positive future - Solution
1536684709215879168 2022-06-14 12:19:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Results  This post ended up with:  - 276,798 impressions - 1,646 engagements - 371 comments  And 600+ new subscribers to my newsletter (nice).  Mission accomplished.
1536684707026505728 2022-06-14 12:19:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Present your solution  The last step is to introduce our solution into the equation.   In this particular instance, the solution was my newsletter, and my intention was to drive subscribers.   You can see that here:  https://t.co/so47VlSxxN
1536684700839956480 2022-06-14 12:19:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Paint a positive future  Now that we have the audience's attention, I work to paint a picture of what a positive future would look like.  A positive future tied to following the intriguing Creator Funnel.  You can see that here:  https://t.co/nAwoB40V9N
1536684694514941953 2022-06-14 12:19:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Introduce something intriguing  Next, I introduce something intriguing.  I want the audience to think, "Wait, what's that?"  So in this post, I introduce something called the Creator Funnel.  My goal is to get them to lean in with interest to carry them through the content.  https://t.co/07OIwQlOtt
1536684688747769859 2022-06-14 12:19:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Agitate the pain  Next, we're going to turn the knife. Make it hurt a bit.  This gets under the reader's skin and makes them...well...agitated.  Once someone is agitated, they are much more likely to be open to a solution.  Here's how I went from problem to agitation:  https://t.co/FxCaGJBTMd
1536684681797767169 2022-06-14 12:19:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Highlight something painful  The 1st line highlights a painful problem that people in my audience experience:  They feel taken advantage of at work.  This line is intended to do 2 things:  1. Elicit a strong emotional response 2. Get the reader to the next line  Then...  https://t.co/BklEasJxWI
1536684675984461825 2022-06-14 12:19:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I have an easy trick to solve these problems.  It's my variation of PAS (problem/agitate/solution) called PAIPS.  - Problem - Agitate - Intrigue - Positive Future - Solution  I'll break down a LinkedIn post of mine that had 276k impressions using this format.  Let's go ↓  https://t.co/JZ3Xvu6trG
1536684669923643393 2022-06-14 12:19:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Because of that, I dreaded writing each day.  I stared at a blank screen, and then sloppily threw together some messy content.  When I finally pressed "post", all of my worries came true.   Nobody read it. Nobody engaged. Nobody cared.  That sucks.
1536684662776528896 2022-06-14 12:19:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> First, If you don't understand human emotion, it's tough to write great copy.  I struggled to write effectively for the first 6 months on social media.  - I didn't have a system - I didn't understand the psychology - I didn't know anything about copywriting
1536684660285128704 2022-06-14 12:19:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A 5-step formula to 10x your copywriting skills:  🧵
1536674588930760707 2022-06-14 11:39:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Chadmgreenlee Great thread, Chad.   So glad you found the course helpful.  Appreciate the kind words 🔥
1536668235856224256 2022-06-14 11:13:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Yep. Always experimenting to see what works. So far, so good.
1536473865794232320 2022-06-13 22:21:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @levelsio @jt7th Day made.  https://t.co/hpsqblnqwc
1536466723670466560 2022-06-13 21:53:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jt7th @levelsio He's somebody I look up to very much.
1536466603021324289 2022-06-13 21:52:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ryanlombardi1 IMO, it's not about "being the best".   Many people spend all of their time on one thing and never succeed, let alone become "the best".  To me, it's more about diversification and risk reduction.  As a solopreneur, I can't afford to have one point of failure.
1536401750877515777 2022-06-13 17:34:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BuzzRobTaylor Yet so often ignored.
1536401747467542528 2022-06-13 17:34:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mrdanielamadi That's how I normally approach it, yes.
1536401677493981194 2022-06-13 17:34:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @igorbenic Love this!
1536401631243296769 2022-06-13 17:34:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Emilio_emb Love that additional context, Emilio.
1536401572846002178 2022-06-13 17:34:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ That's exactly the plan, Matt.
1536401541447524352 2022-06-13 17:34:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic 100%, Zlatko. Always been my preferred approach as well. Much more fun, too.
1536395430451372033 2022-06-13 17:09:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the_robertallan For sure!
1536395361299927040 2022-06-13 17:09:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonhershman Thanks, Jonathan!
1536395336247279616 2022-06-13 17:09:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BBFFMikey Same. That's my whole engine.
1536395297714315264 2022-06-13 17:09:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ionalpha_ Once something is up and running, just push it through this funnel:  - Eliminate what isn't necessary - Automate what you can with tech - Outsource lower value tasks to a VA  Then take the extra time and work on something new.
1536395099889979393 2022-06-13 17:08:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rehacks_ That's exactly it.
1536395061830864896 2022-06-13 17:08:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shaynmtl Awesome, Shayn.
1536394615405920258 2022-06-13 17:06:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AarushiCW Get after it!
1536394586100211712 2022-06-13 17:06:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gjsequeira Yep. I meant it that way (wasn't clear though).   Start with one, then stack.
1536394492093292545 2022-06-13 17:06:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Piyushscopy Agreed.
1536393746719309829 2022-06-13 17:03:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your self-employed income goals are more likely to be achieved with a portfolio strategy.  Think 4-5 smaller income streams.  Provides much greater flexibility and reduced risk when compared to one big bet.
1536387522628050944 2022-06-13 16:38:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew No specific process as of yet.

1536329905520222208 2022-06-13 12:49:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Codie_Sanchez If you don't, it's unlikely anyone else will. And it's REAL easy to see...
1536329834678321157 2022-06-13 12:49:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki As a former Chief Revenue Officer, I approve this message.

1536326503578968065 2022-06-13 12:35:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Thanks, my man!
1536326470842343424 2022-06-13 12:35:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen My newsletter on Saturday broke down part of it, but not all of it.
1536326358347001856 2022-06-13 12:35:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @el_conklin Haha. I guess.
1536326334271655936 2022-06-13 12:35:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel It can be very grueling.
1536325896621248512 2022-06-13 12:33:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack I am.

1536324992278855681 2022-06-13 12:29:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coach_avinash Definitely does, Avinash.
1536324932229021697 2022-06-13 12:29:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamsahiljasuja Absolutely, Sahil.
1536324897709993985 2022-06-13 12:29:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_anthonydisney Also a great idea.

1536019074811043841 2022-06-12 16:14:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshFromCMG Thank you so much!
1535978636368654338 2022-06-12 13:33:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki If someone needs a big team or fancy resources to move the needle, you're looking at someone who generally can't help you early-stage.
1535978495414784000 2022-06-12 13:33:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Brilliantly put.
1535978441849315328 2022-06-12 13:32:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup 100%  - Eliminate that which doesn't move the needle - Automate anything that can be with technology - Outsource lower-value tasks and things you're not good at  Generally, whatever is left over is what you should be doing.
1535975274378145792 2022-06-12 13:20:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Much appreciated, Dan 🔥

1535632811570434049 2022-06-11 14:39:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom An empty calendar is the biggest flex.
1535632696973598726 2022-06-11 14:39:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe The best part about this approach is that problem-solving can become systematic.  Once you learn to solve one problem, you can see the pattern to solving others.  That's when you become really valuable.
1535632484771287041 2022-06-11 14:38:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh I've never met a mediocre person with impostor syndrome.  That always helps me reframe it.
1535631973196222470 2022-06-11 14:36:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Haters are also generally angry at themselves, not you.

1535597795335340032 2022-06-11 12:20:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I almost never sell my products.  I sell my knowledge, insights, and expertise daily.  Product sales are simply an outcome.
1535316509983129600 2022-06-10 17:42:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonbrosio Exactly. That's such a killer way to do it, Jon. Love it.

1534928845786202114 2022-06-09 16:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's better to say no to distractions than be the person everyone likes.
1534888992340160512 2022-06-09 13:23:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe @Ekemini_udoekon Boom.
1534888484044951554 2022-06-09 13:21:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo As someone who jots down ideas randomly, have you ever found this to be untrue?  I'm wondering if you have ever thought, "I wish I could remember X."
1534888230683783168 2022-06-09 13:20:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I love this, Dickie.  Build a system for teaching yourself something new.  Then, go out and teach other people who don't have that system.  A great way to build expertise and trust.
1534887929524457474 2022-06-09 13:19:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches That's right, Charles.  I've actually found that there are some rules that matter and others that can be broken to your advantage.  Like in any field, trendsetters often break the most well-established rules.
1534887677979463680 2022-06-09 13:18:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe When you reach out to someone you admire, assume you are 1 of 100 people doing it.  1. Differentiate yourself 2. Provide relevant value 3. Make a response frictionless
1534887099878543360 2022-06-09 13:16:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki 1. Learn to write 2. Learn to tell stories 3. Learn to paint a positive future  Learn sales.
1534880405698056193 2022-06-09 12:49:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imThomasMorales @naval Damn. I love that. Never heard that of his...
1534877562689703938 2022-06-09 12:38:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevanshiGup @copyforcreators I'm hoping that people catch my drift.
1534877495341744130 2022-06-09 12:38:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsadityabansal For sure, Aditya.
1534877440585129985 2022-06-09 12:37:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenathanpeters Thanks, Nathan.
1534876253748137986 2022-06-09 12:33:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejakeerickson Ha. Thanks, Jake.
1534876212564303872 2022-06-09 12:33:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcryptoyogi Keep going down the funnel, Hitesh!
1534876149293129728 2022-06-09 12:32:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_anthonydisney Exactly, Anthony.
1534876106049867776 2022-06-09 12:32:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eitan_levy101 Definitely most people do, Eitan.
1534876067067985920 2022-06-09 12:32:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyforcreators Yep. Lots of options out there.
1534876024147693569 2022-06-09 12:32:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sairahul1 Love it, Rahul.
1534875992744927234 2022-06-09 12:32:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv.
1534875942375628802 2022-06-09 12:31:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 That's how I started, Abhishek!
1534875882837377024 2022-06-09 12:31:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Exactly, Aadit.
1534875830593241090 2022-06-09 12:31:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano That's the ticket right there, Ben.
1534873537705549824 2022-06-09 12:22:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Piyushscopy Yep, Piyush!
1534872973500366850 2022-06-09 12:20:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What most people do:  - Trade their time for money - Trade money for stuff - Show off their stuff - Repeat  What you should do:  - Trade your time for money - Use that money to create assets - Use those assets to produce money - Use that money to buy your time back
1534628805343596548 2022-06-08 20:09:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Sometimes you just need to get away from it all.  https://t.co/MKsqwOj3Lj
1534576008644403200 2022-06-08 16:40:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This is one of my faves. Love the framework. As a systems thinker this makes my life so much easier.
1534568497988222977 2022-06-08 16:10:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandonthezhang Love that Brandon.
1534568407261118465 2022-06-08 16:09:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rtgiordano Much appreciated man. Thank you.
1534568365108387846 2022-06-08 16:09:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyjoeyjustice Same.
1534568343855841280 2022-06-08 16:09:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Reid_HF Thank you! That’s awesome.
1534568298368606208 2022-06-08 16:09:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiharikaSodhi @aaditsh You two are so kind. It means the world.
1534568250222206976 2022-06-08 16:09:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Piyushscopy Thank you!
1534568180089294849 2022-06-08 16:08:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiharikaSodhi I appreciate that!
1534568151878352898 2022-06-08 16:08:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Thank you, my friend.
1534552430737752070 2022-06-08 15:06:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eveliosilvera Thank you!
1534524785379663872 2022-06-08 13:16:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @calum_johnson9 Well, you're in luck:  https://t.co/RY5XsPKFXt
1534524030543347712 2022-06-08 13:13:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx Thinking about switching up my routine.  Social media is no way to start the day. Coffee, sun, walking, and time with my wife is a much better way to get started.  Some good food for thought, Alex.
1534522705160044544 2022-06-08 13:08:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Building up your own community of motivated people can be the key.  Often, they'll just tell you what to build next.   Very little PMF research needed when this happens.
1534522431288840192 2022-06-08 13:07:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I'm right behind you! Let's GOOO.
1534522122168573952 2022-06-08 13:05:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 And the impact of virality is often not as positive as one might assume.  I've gone viral many times. Doesn't lead to much additional income or customers.  But 10 smaller Tweets aimed at my core audience, in aggregate, makes a world of difference.
1534516821180698624 2022-06-08 12:44:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @masculinitytale True story.
1534516786577694722 2022-06-08 12:44:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JordanReutas This is awesaome, Jordan.
1534516736380260355 2022-06-08 12:44:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Darrenmmatthews This is awesome, Darren.
1534516703777939457 2022-06-08 12:44:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BusinessEngines We must believe these problems can be solved.
1534516659943251970 2022-06-08 12:44:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zaafirsalam Agreed, Zaafir.
1534516630897799171 2022-06-08 12:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timduncaan Haha. Love that.
1534516602300948481 2022-06-08 12:44:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Damn. Love that, Dan.
1534514486178107392 2022-06-08 12:35:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @montipace Exactly.
1534514456591536128 2022-06-08 12:35:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YashpallNirwan That's good to know I'm not just making it up 😂
1534514393635074050 2022-06-08 12:35:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cogentgene I agree with you 100%, Gene.
1534514304459972609 2022-06-08 12:34:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DemoMai99 Nice. Like this.
1534514244359704577 2022-06-08 12:34:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyJimBurgess Haha. I've never thought about it like that, Jim.
1534514195395379200 2022-06-08 12:34:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hermanvaswrites For sure, Herman.
1534514098414702593 2022-06-08 12:34:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theDavidWenk I agree with you 100%. I've only ever worked for optimists and I guess I just don't see another way of thinking.
1534512807835729921 2022-06-08 12:28:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @plemasterr I love that, Phillip.
1534512710867636224 2022-06-08 12:28:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcryptoyogi Yep. I love that, Hitesh.
1534512675304181761 2022-06-08 12:28:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SyedHuq Agreed, Syed.
1534512644778086401 2022-06-08 12:28:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shaynmtl Love that, Shayn!
1534512611353567235 2022-06-08 12:28:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv I just like assuming that there is always a way.
1534512573420298240 2022-06-08 12:28:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic That can certainly be true...
1534511343293894658 2022-06-08 12:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Optimism is a business superpower.   Optimists solve problems before pessimists finish talking about why it can’t be done.
1534286857558798337 2022-06-07 21:31:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 This is awesome man. 🔥
1534214643828371456 2022-06-07 16:44:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People rarely go broke investing in themselves.
1534174862008254465 2022-06-07 14:06:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Thank you, my man!
1534159019656548359 2022-06-07 13:03:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Damn. Nailed it. Could not have said it better myself (and I tried)
1534154925713809408 2022-06-07 12:46:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @plemasterr @tdinh_me @JustinSaaS Damn. Whoops.
1534151828425818113 2022-06-07 12:34:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_baillee If you can teach yourself, you can do almost anything.
1534151493380624385 2022-06-07 12:33:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom For sure. I’m 100% guilty of it.   It takes a lot of intention to fight through it.
1534150255427584000 2022-06-07 12:28:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @asearchforvalue Same, Hunter.
1534150206199152640 2022-06-07 12:28:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @The_GreatBonnie Thanks, Bonnie!
1534148771168280577 2022-06-07 12:22:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Absolutely. None of the rest of this matters if you have no strategy!
1534148517853335554 2022-06-07 12:21:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Yep. Can't start without trying and failing multiple times.
1534148455521714177 2022-06-07 12:21:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel Love that, Jason.
1534147741969948672 2022-06-07 12:18:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_anthonydisney @tdinh_me @JustinSaaS Yep. But if you can get it while doing what you enjoy, it certainly gives you more optionality.
1534147004242219008 2022-06-07 12:15:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me And, that's a wrap...  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these  2.

1534147001453002752 2022-06-07 12:15:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me 10/ Follower count doesn't matter  It's not ALL that matters, but it's an indicator that your content is resonating.  And with that, you'll have a better chance to build a business, land a job, find opportunities, meet interesting people, etc.  And that's why most of us are here.
1534146999444033536 2022-06-07 12:15:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me 9/ Not everyone was meant to be an entrepreneur  Maybe everyone wasn't meant to build SaaS business, but entrepreneurship?  That CAN be for anyone.  Offer a service, sell an eBook, build a Shopify store, start a side hustle, etc.  Don't let people project their fears onto you.
1534146997514555392 2022-06-07 12:15:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me 8/ If you have faith in yourself, you don't need a Plan B  Again, randomness and chance are at play here.  Build your career like a venture capitalist, not a venture-backed founder.  Have a plan A, B, C, D, E, and F.  Increase your chances, and decrease your risk.
1534146995551707142 2022-06-07 12:15:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me 7/ Work a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life  I love my job more than anything.  I've transitioned out of executive leadership in tech and into a full-time creator helping thousands of people.  It's still a ton of work.   The most work I've ever done.
1534146993458651136 2022-06-07 12:15:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me 6/ Good things come to those who wait  Good things come to those who take action in the short term and stay consistent in the long term.  Waiting and waiting until everything is "perfect" will yield the opposite of "good things".  It will likely yield nothing.
1534146991449681923 2022-06-07 12:15:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me 5/ There are no stupid questions  "Stupid" is a pretty subjective term, but there are questions that can easily be Googled.  If you skip Googling and ask (at work, in life, etc.) you'll be labeled as a liability rather than an asset.  Teaching yourself is a wonderful habit.
1534146989151207424 2022-06-07 12:15:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results  Randomness &amp; chance are at play in every attempt.   It's why @tdinh_me posted the same thing to Hacker News 4 times with no traction.   Then it blew up.   https://t.co/vX9Pmktuzg
1534146987259580418 2022-06-07 12:15:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Cheaters never win  Nearly everyone who is someone has cheated in their ascension to the top.  It doesn't necessarily make it right, but it's 100% true.  And unfortunately, that's why we have a lot of poor academics and rich criminals.  Always be moderately skeptical.
1534146985325998080 2022-06-07 12:15:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Quality over quantity  Sometimes.  But when you're just starting out in any new endeavor, repetition matters.  So start with quantity to help find the quality.  Then do both.  High output, high quality. Win/Win.
1534146983371350021 2022-06-07 12:15:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Money doesn't buy happiness  It may not buy happiness, but it buys freedom and flexibility.  The more that you have, the easier it is to say no to things you don't like.  Doing less of what you hate and more of what you like makes you a much happier person.
1534146981270114305 2022-06-07 12:15:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10 business clichés that are lies (or at least misunderstood):
1533858707494379521 2022-06-06 17:09:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Study people, not algorithms.  Algorithms change.  People do not.
1533799574015557633 2022-06-06 13:14:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Being able to communicate effectively through writing is something that anyone, especially entrepreneurs, should spend a lot of time practicing and perfecting.  Changed my life.
1533792329160699904 2022-06-06 12:46:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GunToHeadCopy For sure, Santosh.
1533792295635496960 2022-06-06 12:45:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcryptoyogi I agree. Lots of talk about niches, but I'm in the camp of having one.
1533792230372265985 2022-06-06 12:45:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Certainly is, Luke. Stay focused and develop one core skill.
1533792166203490307 2022-06-06 12:45:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Yep. Go deep on what you already know.
1533792096649363456 2022-06-06 12:45:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedavelyman This is really awesome. Thanks for sharing, Dave.
1533788261595893760 2022-06-06 12:29:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @createwithdee 100%
1533788219539611649 2022-06-06 12:29:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CarinCamen That's the kicker right there.
1533788177303015428 2022-06-06 12:29:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BlackEmpressoff Deepen them, and leverage them.
1533788141299159045 2022-06-06 12:29:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TKAllDay62 Yep. But it all starts with simply being aware of what skills we already have. Lots of folks are blind to their own knowledge.
1533787983941447681 2022-06-06 12:28:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @digiarpit For sure. It starts there.
1533787937590190081 2022-06-06 12:28:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @connectABTweets Thanks, Abdullah.
1533787911832977409 2022-06-06 12:28:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @3PillarsParent Definitely. I just don't write for parents :)
1533787855876673539 2022-06-06 12:28:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD Nearly 100% of the time. Very true.
1533785866606460929 2022-06-06 12:20:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KalimoLeboela @jenny_blake Awesome. I'll have to take a look. Thanks, Kalimo.
1533785831797833729 2022-06-06 12:20:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KalimoLeboela I love that. And Cal Newport rocks.
1533784948246732800 2022-06-06 12:16:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Many people still need to identify the skills they have that they can monetize. They are often blind to their own value.
1533784235009622017 2022-06-06 12:13:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most solopreneurs are long on ambition but short on strategy.  Before you try making money, make sure that you're identifying and developing skills you already have.  Once you've done that, monetization becomes much easier.
1533440029002977280 2022-06-05 13:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Yesterday, 27,843 creators learned my favorite:  1. All-in-one creator tool 2. Analytics platform 3. Testimonial tool 4. Twitter plugin 5. Newsletter  Did you miss issue #22 of The Saturday Solopreneur?  Read it here:  https://t.co/bTloRerENw
1533164182211895296 2022-06-04 19:10:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mjtommasi Not at all. This is awesome. Thanks, Marcello!
1533078782055153666 2022-06-04 13:30:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nomadsammey Thanks, Samson! Appreciate you reading it.
1533078022487687168 2022-06-04 13:27:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotechAna I love this, Ana. Thanks for sharing!
1533077776214831104 2022-06-04 13:26:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rehacks_ Thank you so much! I appreciate that. 🙌
1533075273993838592 2022-06-04 13:16:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Nice thread, Matt. Thanks for the feature!
1533074791841861633 2022-06-04 13:14:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daniel_nguyenx For sure, similar. That was the foundation for this with a few small tweaks.
1533074736128966658 2022-06-04 13:14:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmAnasAmrani Thanks, Amrani
1533074717401284609 2022-06-04 13:14:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ken_carroll For sure, Ken. Can tweak this many different ways.
1533074650900602880 2022-06-04 13:14:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_areebpasha I don't really have titles for my stories. Just tell this one out loud on a podcast.
1533074375100059648 2022-06-04 13:13:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlKaufmanADI Yep. A slightly different spin on the heroes journey, but that's the basic foundation for sure.
1533074305667502080 2022-06-04 13:12:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andyfieb It's a great way to connect the audience to your journey.
1533074243583463424 2022-06-04 13:12:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jdchernikoff @anacarmagnani @Johngamba7 Glad it was helpful, Josh.
1533074203964018694 2022-06-04 13:12:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tejas3732 Thanks, Tejas!
1533073366306930689 2022-06-04 13:09:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every solopreneur needs a well-crafted backstory.  This is an opportunity to tell your true story in a compelling fashion. To connect with the audience in a way that's human.  Here's my 7-step process for a compelling backstory.  https://t.co/OZ81iYCeOI
1533061548461150209 2022-06-04 12:22:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge The GCal nerd in me has set this one aside to dive in.
1532769611447508992 2022-06-03 17:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I love no-code tools.  They have made building a one-person business possible for everyone.  Tomorrow, I'm going to share my 4 favorite no-code tools, and one newsletter you cannot afford to miss.  Join 27,843 subscribers here:  https://t.co/vCOnWlle21
1532723646770335744 2022-06-03 13:59:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Systems are the foundation of any one-person business.  Anything you find yourself doing over and over?  Build a system.
1532723506882002946 2022-06-03 13:58:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Do the work and life tosses you a lot more "luck".
1532723370181132288 2022-06-03 13:58:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao I would argue less than 5% of people do this at the previous companies I worked at. Those were always the folks that made it to the top.  A wonderful way to stand out.
1532723096502812672 2022-06-03 13:57:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches 1. Record a 30-minute interview. 2. Chop it up into 10 LI, Twitter, and Instagram vids. 3. Put the conversation on podcast page. 4. Turn it into 5 TikToks.   The combos are endless.
1532713993613213697 2022-06-03 13:21:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_bigfield @ImraneSubstack @softr_io @airtable @gumroad Shit, thank you man. :)
1532713895500070914 2022-06-03 13:20:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Put your thoughts into the world and meet other like-minded (or opposite minded) people.
1532713726264107009 2022-06-03 13:20:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GuruAnaerobic Appreciate the share so much. 💪
1532713554612199425 2022-06-03 13:19:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephen_parato Thanks, Stephen. It helps me.
1532713531342213123 2022-06-03 13:19:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheAnkurTyagi I love that about it, Ankur.
1532713506361036800 2022-06-03 13:19:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylegawley Fair point.
1532713479727104001 2022-06-03 13:19:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MrRyanKeeler How we use it. Exactly, Ryan.
1532713367672061952 2022-06-03 13:18:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cogentgene Gonna try that here shortly.
1532713332955824130 2022-06-03 13:18:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theartofchaoz Once you realize it though? Game changer.
1532713285790973958 2022-06-03 13:18:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_anthonydisney Nailed it, Anthony.
1532713229893394432 2022-06-03 13:18:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD That's exactly it, Tom.
1532713195361734658 2022-06-03 13:17:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Piyushscopy For sure!
1532713155373187072 2022-06-03 13:17:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @afu_dev Absolutely, Adrien.
1532713119251943424 2022-06-03 13:17:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmAnasAmrani Good call.
1532713104995405824 2022-06-03 13:17:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisrickard Yep. Same here.
1532713075266277377 2022-06-03 13:17:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessebmaher It can all feel like a chore if you think of it that way. Think about building insanely valuable relationships and it becomes quite a bit easier.
1532712972359028737 2022-06-03 13:17:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EmanThinks That's right, Gordon.
1532712926699835393 2022-06-03 13:16:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse Me and you both, man.
1532712896316297218 2022-06-03 13:16:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis That's the lens through which to view it for sure, Teddy.
1532712848727715840 2022-06-03 13:16:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Yes sir.
1532703647481708546 2022-06-03 12:40:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_bigfield @softr_io @airtable @gumroad Let's GOOO. Love this. 🚀
1532699901246722049 2022-06-03 12:25:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When you stop viewing Twitter as a chore and start viewing it as a 24/7 networking event, you'll no longer stress about content.
1532681425446703105 2022-06-03 11:11:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @greglim81 Zirtual for me.
1532681393083453440 2022-06-03 11:11:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RakeshTheKumar Yep.  https://t.co/RY5XsPKFXt

1532482651050987524 2022-06-02 22:01:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Category 🏴‍☠️
1532482620608729096 2022-06-02 22:01:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Exactly how I feel as a solopreneur/creator (or whatever the hell I am).
1532482095985184787 2022-06-02 21:59:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisViglietta @SonOfDeFi I do want to launch that in the future, yes.
1532481952011505691 2022-06-02 21:59:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShriramNad It's a combination of courses, subscriptions and a tiny bit of coaching.

1532453729793982500 2022-06-02 20:06:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano @paulocoelho Great thread, Ben.  I read The Alchemist in one sitting and it's one of my favorite books of all time. Love it.
1532421593842032640 2022-06-02 17:59:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Welcome back. Did the same last year, in the same country.
1532421206351171588 2022-06-02 17:57:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx People love to hate on LeBron, but the guy has done it all.  - One of the best - A few championship rings - Never been in trouble - No family drama - Charitable work - Gives back to his community  Dude's a legend.  (Side note: I'm from Cleveland)
1532420864758652928 2022-06-02 17:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KeshTFE I use @Zirtual
1532420623661670400 2022-06-02 17:55:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KeshTFE @bentossell Much appreciated, Kesh!

1532394036333621248 2022-06-02 16:09:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ericdrowell @Natalie_Furn For sure. I just happen to focus on soloprenuers.
1532393508228800517 2022-06-02 16:07:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Thanks, Teddy!
1532393396958019584 2022-06-02 16:07:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD @Natalie_Furn So much time.
1532393368826822657 2022-06-02 16:07:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @plemasterr You get a lot "luckier" when you know a bunch of brilliant people.
1532393267689664517 2022-06-02 16:06:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fitwithrashid Yep! Or things just pile up.
1532393165222813698 2022-06-02 16:06:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JonathanDanger4 The worst.
1532393130523238401 2022-06-02 16:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Yep. Worth trying interesting new things all of the time.
1532392861802631179 2022-06-02 16:05:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's certainly a very large part of it.
1532392665630883840 2022-06-02 16:04:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JosephSeifert22 I think it's ok to consume. That's where I get some of my best inspiration.
1532392136141946880 2022-06-02 16:02:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Things that kill a one-person business:  1. A big ego 2. Not networking 3. Not having a VA 4. No experimenting 5. Ignoring feedback 6. Too many meetings 7. Very little marketing 8. Not saying "no" enough 9. Lack of business systems  Avoid as many of these as possible.

1532362562603466754 2022-06-02 14:04:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 ❄️
1532362448451297280 2022-06-02 14:04:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Codie_Sanchez If you can keep the same demeanor and attitude through both the worst and the best, you'll likely be pretty excellent at what you do.
1532362299704586242 2022-06-02 14:03:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Too much validation from non-prospects. Not enough validation from actual prospects.
1532362174772944897 2022-06-02 14:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches All advice is contextual to the person giving it. That's why I rarely ask, "How did you do X?". Instead, I like to collect information, test it, see if it works for me in a similar fashion, and discard it if it doesn't.
1532348478755569665 2022-06-02 13:08:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I've got you matched on that first 5 hours.  Same meal? I'm too much of a foodie!
1532348265605251073 2022-06-02 13:07:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak One part of my plan is simply outlasting everyone else 😂
1532345467576668165 2022-06-02 12:56:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @baltunt @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Thank you, man!
1532340883550609408 2022-06-02 12:38:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlKaufmanADI I think this is it:  https://t.co/NpmCY3UEES
1532340826914930689 2022-06-02 12:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis I don't ask much anymore, except for passively in the LI comments. This is my one.
1532339735020150785 2022-06-02 12:33:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe One of the biggest distractions are meetings and events you should have originally said "no" to.  My advice: Create a "NO" template. Something that is kind but firm, that you can use every single time someone asks.
1532339337051906048 2022-06-02 12:32:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaviningham Simple, but skipped by 99%.
1532339258844913664 2022-06-02 12:32:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TothSebastien There wasn't. Just an ask :)
1532339205392809985 2022-06-02 12:31:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Correct. If you give daily, you earn the right to ask. That's my philosophy.
1532338383909011457 2022-06-02 12:28:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlKaufmanADI Wrote a post online and asked people to buy it if they were suffering any of the problems that the product is intended to solve.
1532338358722117633 2022-06-02 12:28:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FinessToday Wrote a post online and asked people to buy it if they were suffering any of the problem that the product is intended to solve.
1532338264866177024 2022-06-02 12:28:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaronmmota Give 90%, Ask 10%
1532338239243177985 2022-06-02 12:28:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylepdotco Haha. What is it??
1532338218959618048 2022-06-02 12:27:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Exactly.
1532338180690780162 2022-06-02 12:27:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse For sure. But sometimes it's as easy as saying, "If you struggle with this, my product will help you. You should check it out today."
1532337307054968835 2022-06-02 12:24:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Boom 💥
1532337154587824131 2022-06-02 12:23:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcryptoyogi Yep. And if you give enough, you can make that "ask".
1532336260521635840 2022-06-02 12:20:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Sometimes you need to ask people to buy your product.  If you don't, you're missing out on 12x days.  Simple as that.  https://t.co/8LIJUMXB8w
1532061755156729857 2022-06-01 18:09:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Codie_Sanchez This is dope. Going to build out ours this weekend. Thanks for the push, Codie.
1532061497110560768 2022-06-01 18:08:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Y'all are just killing the game. Congrats, man.
1532061415078387712 2022-06-01 18:08:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Here's what I have:   - Weekly must-do - Daily must-do - Daily intentions  Intentions are less about work and more about pulling away from work to accomplish things that make me a happier person.
1532039132381433858 2022-06-01 16:39:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Absolutely valuable, Keyur.
1532039091411460103 2022-06-01 16:39:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heykahn Same. Or someone will come across a post of mine from 2020.
1532039043420143618 2022-06-01 16:39:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamVazquez @EmanThinks Oh fur sure, Adam.
1532038998318886912 2022-06-01 16:38:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EmanThinks @cogentgene Ain't that the truth. Sometimes I think I've got a banger and it flops. Then the reverse happens.
1532038902978076673 2022-06-01 16:38:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonriedel @EmanThinks I post 2x per day and comment 20x.
1532038835865100289 2022-06-01 16:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsconchur Good luck!
1532038806140080128 2022-06-01 16:38:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chieybae Way better than chasing virality.
1532038757876375552 2022-06-01 16:37:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EmanThinks Good rule to live by.
1532038732102217728 2022-06-01 16:37:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amichalek For sure, Andrea.
1532038708777582592 2022-06-01 16:37:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StartupGotts Awesome. Welcome back!
1532038650900496384 2022-06-01 16:37:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmRobGee That's it. And sometimes adjusting a few words makes a world of difference.
1532038596215054338 2022-06-01 16:37:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_rubiopaty For sure. That happens all of the time for me.
1532038551256301568 2022-06-01 16:37:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JohnIsBuilding Damn. I love that.
1532038526837063680 2022-06-01 16:37:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JosephSeifert22 Thanks, Joseph.
1532038500215836673 2022-06-01 16:36:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's it, Dhruv.
1532038468355883009 2022-06-01 16:36:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nomadsammey I'm sure you grew followers. The "new followers" number is always wrong.
1532029749530353664 2022-06-01 16:02:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most Solopreneurs misunderstand content.  It's not about daily virality attempts.  It's about having thousands of your thoughts in the ecosystem at any moment in time.  1000+ pieces working hard on your behalf.  So, publish frequently.  Because you never know what will resonate.
1532000068227801088 2022-06-01 14:04:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This is why I say no to 90% of what comes my way.   I'm either working on something for someone else, or I'm working on improving my business, and therefore my life.
1531999897053974531 2022-06-01 14:03:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak I think most people work for money to provide for their family. There's no shame in that and it's common at most large companies.  I think the best people get aligned a company &amp; mission that they believe in and do great work. The money is important but not #1.
1531980825209753601 2022-06-01 12:47:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the_jacobmartin Nailed it. The "luckiest" people often put in massive action, Jacob.
1531980756922376194 2022-06-01 12:47:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SallyCreator You can't outwork the value of relationships!
1531980676488208384 2022-06-01 12:47:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @praveneum For sure, Pravesh.
1531980640215879681 2022-06-01 12:47:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue Same. Give to get.
1531980612529274880 2022-06-01 12:46:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Absolutely.   Just jamming out on Zoom with you and 50+ other people over the last 6 months has greatly increased my "luck".
1531980321784270850 2022-06-01 12:45:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SyedHuq It really doesn't, Syed.
1531977021479432192 2022-06-01 12:32:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RSahasrarchi For sure, Rohan.
1531976976214401025 2022-06-01 12:32:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nicolasmerouze The better you are at a skill, and the smarter you work to improve your chances, the "luckier" you get.
1531976839861870593 2022-06-01 12:31:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danielakpobare It really is, Daniel.
1531976327817052161 2022-06-01 12:29:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare You'll find yourself in the right place at the right time more frequently if you increase your luck surface area.
1531976227455631369 2022-06-01 12:29:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HirschiIvona An art that most people struggle with.
1531976195276955648 2022-06-01 12:29:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsedaxe The better you work, the luckier you seem to get.
1531976142634237958 2022-06-01 12:29:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @camp_wealth Same. Weird huh?
1531976121163694086 2022-06-01 12:29:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Diwakar28801704 Same. Karma game.
1531976084346097667 2022-06-01 12:28:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cogentgene Isn't that funny how it works?
1531976037952892928 2022-06-01 12:28:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theTonyNash For sure. Once you build them, everything else becomes much easier.
1531975995208740865 2022-06-01 12:28:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoeHolka Definitely part of it.
1531975969497653249 2022-06-01 12:28:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's right. Systems certainly have their place in increasing your luck.
1531974813459308544 2022-06-01 12:23:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @dickiebush @rosiesherry @harrydry @austinbelcak @aprildunford @AmandaMGoetz @businessbarista @gregisenberg Thank you, Matt!
1531974622861729793 2022-06-01 12:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to improve your luck:  - Make noise - Hone in on signal - Double down on that - Support other builders - Engage regularly, with care - Turn great engagements into 1:1s - Turn 1:1s into meaningful relationships  The more relationships you build, the more your luck intensifies.
1531955378430279681 2022-06-01 11:06:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo @TrungTPhan @chrishlad @david_perell @dvassallo @nathanbaugh27 @Codie_Sanchez Much appreciated, my man. Thank you.
1531954655961432073 2022-06-01 11:03:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me Anytime, my man. I love your product and I love sharing products that genuinely help, are priced fairly, and that get better constantly. That's yours!
1531784081846984704 2022-05-31 23:45:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Emilio_emb @Codie_Sanchez Much harder than I would have anticipated, but a combo of written and video process docs is a life saver.
1531783977081704449 2022-05-31 23:45:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TothSebastien @gregisenberg Purchases. I presell before anything is built.
1531766443859222528 2022-05-31 22:35:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Every product I've built started as an idea and a landing page. I don't build it until there is monetary proof of interest. Good stuff, Greg.
1531766133510000644 2022-05-31 22:34:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Codie_Sanchez Built video process docs for the 6 things I spend the most administrative time on about 3 months ago.  I estimate I'm saving about 40 hours per month of work and reinvesting that time into creative.
1531765725198688258 2022-05-31 22:33:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo You can spend $10k per month and grow your online business or you can spend $0 per month and grow your online business.  Some tools make it easier/faster/more efficient, but in the end, you can get it done at nearly no-cost.  Congrats!
1531765275745468420 2022-05-31 22:31:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonriedel It pulls based on handle. So you'll just see my best stuff since the change.
1531754542303432706 2022-05-31 21:48:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonriedel It wont have most of them because I changed my handle 2 weeks ago. Womp womp.
1531754384090189825 2022-05-31 21:47:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoganBrownSWS @SahilBloom Voice notes mostly.
1531722061982445568 2022-05-31 19:39:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Then write 15 minutes per day on top of that. Watch what happen.
1531721988863139841 2022-05-31 19:39:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I love silent time. This is when ideas flow into my brain most frequently. Driving, showering, doing the dishes.   Way more helpful than listening to a podcast.
1531721803227353090 2022-05-31 19:38:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Can Typeshare fix the fact that I can't type on my phone? 😂
1531713017611689991 2022-05-31 19:03:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh @SahilBloom @blakeaburge @DruRly @JamesClear Thanks so much, Harsh! Appreciate your support.
1531707906315403271 2022-05-31 18:43:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heykahn Heck yeah, Zain. Congrats, man!
1531683356265652225 2022-05-31 17:05:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic Haha 😂
1531683308093984769 2022-05-31 17:05:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 @BrianFOConnor I think offering a service is generally a helpful starting point.
1531683213457903618 2022-05-31 17:05:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cleiton_dev Lots. Check out my website.
1531683179383463937 2022-05-31 17:05:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dancumberland I haven't done anything yet.
1531683142200852482 2022-05-31 17:04:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic @heychazza Get after it, fellas.
1531683076690042881 2022-05-31 17:04:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimplyAzodo Thank you!
1531683038152769536 2022-05-31 17:04:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamVazquez Can't wait to see 2027.
1531683001930850304 2022-05-31 17:04:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hendcm Panic attack in late 2018 started it all.
1531682947513868288 2022-05-31 17:04:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kurtbuilds Thanks, Kurt. I'm sure you'll be right there with me!
1531682879972974593 2022-05-31 17:03:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrendanHufford Very, very true.
1531682859957772291 2022-05-31 17:03:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Meshrhm Get after it, Mesh. I wish you luck.
1531682798649675776 2022-05-31 17:03:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_baillee I'm excited to see 10 years down the road
1531682748536082434 2022-05-31 17:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WrittenMastery Luck is usually an outcome of a lot of hard work.
1531682689451008000 2022-05-31 17:03:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets It felt very, very long. :)
1531682649810554881 2022-05-31 17:02:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis I sure hope so. And many thanks, my man!

1531653994036219910 2022-05-31 15:09:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Nice!
1531646277963894784 2022-05-31 14:38:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Same for me!
1531646252038901760 2022-05-31 14:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Thank you, my man 🙌
1531646057746161666 2022-05-31 14:37:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @polak_jasper No, but that's awesome.
1531645997440503809 2022-05-31 14:37:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DetroitArmy Many of them. My website is full of them.
1531645906961014785 2022-05-31 14:36:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @idhammer @followerwonk Not sure.

1531627595279785988 2022-05-31 13:24:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe That SCAMPER is solid, man. Stealing.
1531623717247365121 2022-05-31 13:08:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me Always. Thanks for the new "how-to" page. I learned a lot of tricks for using it more effectively.
1531623422018592769 2022-05-31 13:07:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Lowlip2 Because I'm not trying to make money by mentioning these products. I like them and I like the founders.  I just want to see them succeed and I like being a part of that.
1531623114861420544 2022-05-31 13:06:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Easy way to get started is with a Pomodoro timer.
1531622959928033280 2022-05-31 13:05:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Warning: reading about how to do something won't actually get it done.
1531621877134794753 2022-05-31 13:01:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LuisDuquePE Thanks for reading, Luis.
1531621804376219648 2022-05-31 13:01:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ownit_Fran Benefits of all of these are seen over time, never immediately.
1531621729646297089 2022-05-31 13:00:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Darrenmmatthews Thanks for reading, Darren.

1531621474418802690 2022-05-31 12:59:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jabuto_Jabuto Awesome, thanks, Jabuto.
1531620293155901441 2022-05-31 12:55:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nickvitucci Nope. Maybe one day though.
1531620069779857409 2022-05-31 12:54:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jakevictor_ Hell yeah. I've been here!
1531619889059975168 2022-05-31 12:53:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge It's a game-changer. I'm terrible with spouse and kid's names and whatnot.
1531619759468564480 2022-05-31 12:53:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Soumyadeep_0 @twemex @followerwonk @hypefury @blackmagic_so @TwitterBlue More. About 400+ per day.
1531618942896201735 2022-05-31 12:49:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Sweet! It's such a great tool. Especially once I started to truly understand the power.
1531618157395382273 2022-05-31 12:46:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD Sweet. It's a great little tool.
1531618132267257858 2022-05-31 12:46:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PersuasionProf Awesome. Have fun!
1531617672408010753 2022-05-31 12:44:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ It's such a powerful feature, for sure.
1531617191539490816 2022-05-31 12:42:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlanJLSmith @Nicolascole77 Amazing! Thanks for being a customer. See you inside.
1531617041651834883 2022-05-31 12:42:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Absolutely, Nick. So glad they were helpful. 🙌
1531616966829649923 2022-05-31 12:41:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @camp_wealth Right?
1531616940413927425 2022-05-31 12:41:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ It's amazing. @dvassallo talks about it quite frequently, and ever since @tdinh_me released his "how-to" video set, it's been a game-changer for me.
1531616043063549953 2022-05-31 12:38:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlanJLSmith @twemex Yep. You're right. Whoops.
1531615745838395394 2022-05-31 12:37:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vrsceo Thanks, Varun.

1531615560538198018 2022-05-31 12:36:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Oh damn. It's my absolute favorite tool on Twitter.
1531615499817205760 2022-05-31 12:36:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco Thanks, Henry!
1531615468208934913 2022-05-31 12:35:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachtalkswealth I Tweet 2x per day, and by staggering RTs at 9 hours, my schedule looks like this:  Tweet 1: 730a Tweet 2: 12p RT1 : 4:30p RT2: 9p  Basically, good coverage.
1531615050443653120 2022-05-31 12:34:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CPASuperHero Well, now you are!

1531614677951823878 2022-05-31 12:32:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachtalkswealth Certainly, Zach. Thanks for reading.

1531614580023115776 2022-05-31 12:32:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Awesome. Thanks, Dhruv.

And they can be distracting and detrimental to your mental health.  Unless you install "Hide Twitter Trends".  This plugin will let you focus and regain your sanity by hiding the trends section.  Highly recommend.  https://t.co/ownR5eCX4b
1531613857835323395 2022-05-31 12:29:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @twemex @followerwonk @hypefury @blackmagic_so @TwitterBlue 9/ Mute conversations  Ever get mentioned in a tweet &amp; you start getting hundreds of notifications?  It clogs up your whole notification feed.  Expand the details of the tweet and click the 3 dots on the top right-hand corner.  Then, click "mute this conversation."  https://t.co/dzz9PoaX3q
1531613845692850179 2022-05-31 12:29:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @twemex @followerwonk @hypefury @blackmagic_so @TwitterBlue 8/ Creating powerful lists  Lists are a powerful way to organize a relevant Twitter ecosystem.  Just create your lists and add your people.  Once you do, you can visit lists to see all relevant Tweets from that group.  Great for groups, local meetups, and any other organization.  https://t.co/30ICULbDBj
1531613832598237184 2022-05-31 12:29:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @twemex @followerwonk @hypefury @blackmagic_so 7/ Bookmark folders  Want to save and organize your favorite Tweets?

Or maybe how you met? Or if someone introduced you?  @blackmagic_so also has built-in CRM functionality.  Never forget another important detail.  https://t.co/PuDwxRZx1Z
1531613808506163200 2022-05-31 12:29:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @twemex @followerwonk @hypefury 5/ Hyper-fast engagement  Engaging with top accounts is crucial.  I use @blackmagic_so to create my list of important accounts.  It shows me how many Tweets I've missed from them.  Then, 2x per day, I engage at hyper-speed to keep growing.  You can do it right from the sidebar!  https://t.co/FBm8iu5Tk5
1531613779322187778 2022-05-31 12:29:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @twemex @followerwonk 3/ Auto-retweeting for growth  The shelf-life of a Tweet is about 24 hours.  One great way to get more engagement is to Retweet yourself.  I RT myself 9 hours later using @hypefury  The best part? They UN-Retweet 24 hours later.  That keeps your profile nice and clean.  https://t.co/MFyGMehLNv
1531613767158702080 2022-05-31 12:29:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @twemex 2/ Most active times  It's best to Tweet when your followers are online.  Do you know when they are most active?  Twitter doesn't tell you, but @Followerwonk does  Get more engagement with better timing.  https://t.co/wnPBFNABop
1531613755737612290 2022-05-31 12:29:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Most popular Tweets  Ever wanted to find someone's most popular Tweets of all-time?  Or maybe their most popular recent Tweets?  Install @Twemex App and instantly find them all.  https://t.co/Xi4AIxfiKo
1531613739560075264 2022-05-31 12:29:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10 powerful Twitter hacks every user should know:
1531332942923980800 2022-05-30 17:53:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @msskwan Yes. You want to write about your expertise. Not mine.
1531320302382325762 2022-05-30 17:03:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe One person, one problem, one solution. Help them get from point A to point B.
1531320222371790850 2022-05-30 17:02:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Share your knowledge from the beginning. Share it again when you have a larger audience. Then again, and again, and again.
1531259720819933185 2022-05-30 13:02:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChaseArbeiter That's a question many of us arrive at when it's definitely too late.
1531259410164621313 2022-05-30 13:01:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattmylin Absolutely correct, Matt. Don't let it rule you.
1531256669388390400 2022-05-30 12:50:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Congrats, man! Enjoy the drive.
1531256592678719488 2022-05-30 12:49:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Once you figure out how to turn discomfort into comfort, you're on to something. That's where the change happens.
1531256033565413379 2022-05-30 12:47:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide For sure, Hassan. Don't work for terrible people.
1531255969472184321 2022-05-30 12:47:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @changingdailly Love this, Darren.
1531253660151341057 2022-05-30 12:38:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shaynmtl That's basically what I decided.
1531253626831872002 2022-05-30 12:38:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yukti_sood Yep. Can be very difficult, but it's best to try.
1531253535064596481 2022-05-30 12:37:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikeying77 Yep. Go make lots of money in a job that treats you well and you're winning.
1531252274663763968 2022-05-30 12:32:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_anthonydisney Sure. But those aren't the people I write for.
1531251683442970624 2022-05-30 12:30:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare For certain, Keyur.
1531251642892529664 2022-05-30 12:30:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yekeenAyo Always.
1531251612387254272 2022-05-30 12:30:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @polak_jasper Same.
1531251600681013248 2022-05-30 12:30:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jkerr25 I'm glad you learned it!
1531251568611319809 2022-05-30 12:29:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vcuody Life is pretty damn important, yes.
1531251520657817600 2022-05-30 12:29:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyforcreators I enjoy that quote...
1531250602650525696 2022-05-30 12:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Never work a job that destroys your mental health.  Even with massive pay, it doesn't work.  Instead:  1. Find a great role 2. Focus on your mental health 3. Spend time working on passion projects 4. Turn them into a full-time business over time  Harder to do when burned out.
1531248572347318273 2022-05-30 12:18:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @Shopify @gumroad Thanks for the shout, Matt! Always appreciated, my man.
1531248475794550784 2022-05-30 12:17:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup @mrsharma @joepohlen @evanmr @bobbyfijan @nagda @NdamukongSuh @chrishalligan @admsteiner @AlexAndBooks_ @nickvitucci @Scottbeverett @businessbarista @Codie_Sanchez @SahilBloom Thanks for the shout, Nick. Much appreciated. 🙌
1530935358619262977 2022-05-29 15:33:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thanks for the feature, my man. Much appreciated. 💪
1530934964627324930 2022-05-29 15:31:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Really solid thread, man. I'm a huge fan of the 5 why's.
1530904214225965060 2022-05-29 13:29:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichePriest @theandreboso Thank you, Miche!
1530901701099651074 2022-05-29 13:19:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Do interesting things offline and talk about them online. That's basically it.
1530901166401396737 2022-05-29 13:17:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ And books aren't the only way to consume people's knowledge.  - Podcasts - Youtube videos - Digital courses - Social media content  So many ways to consume and learn.
1530900939862949888 2022-05-29 13:16:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh This is some really, really good, clear advice.
1530900445421502464 2022-05-29 13:14:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelsklar That's right. Focus on the process and the rest often comes.
1530900367223017472 2022-05-29 13:14:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coachjillian A second house ;-)
1530899137004183552 2022-05-29 13:09:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsedaxe Focus on the audience and distribution and that money will be a nice outcome.
1530899030120845313 2022-05-29 13:09:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sujitdevkar Help people to help yourself.
1530898998961242114 2022-05-29 13:08:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets That's 100% true.
1530898964366639105 2022-05-29 13:08:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timduncaan Very cool. I'm just learning.
1530897908832387072 2022-05-29 13:04:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Definitely, Keyur.
1530897879774134272 2022-05-29 13:04:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj That's right. Monetization is an outcome.
1530897359701430274 2022-05-29 13:02:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There's too much focus on monetization.  Making money is great – but the best solopreneurs realize that money is an outcome of audience and distribution.  Focus on that.   The money will likely come.
1530881537696313345 2022-05-29 11:59:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj @sweatystartup Thanks, Louie!
1530881421614714881 2022-05-29 11:59:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChaseArbeiter I don't actually know, to be honest. I feel like 5,000 - 10,000 is probably a good starting point. It's my understanding you can typically charge about 5% of your subscriber count per issue, in dollars.
1530565448038768640 2022-05-28 15:03:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AngeZanetti @SEOKeval @Aazarshad @heykahn @dickiebush @MarketingMax @amandanat @Cody_Wittick Thank you, my man!

1530297222310596609 2022-05-27 21:17:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Probably the best community I've been a part of.  Organic conversation, smart people, good learnings.   A no-brainer if you're into making investments in yourself.
1530296750375837698 2022-05-27 21:15:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg When I worked in tech, it was the people. I came from a farm town in Ohio and when I met people who wanted to change the world, I was astounded.  If I ever go back, it will be for the same reason. Brilliant, forward-thinking people.
1530296086472048640 2022-05-27 21:13:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Feeling this, Charles. Great Tweet.
1530242117230002178 2022-05-27 17:38:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Moe_Shaltout That's classic survivorship bias, though.  Instead, look at the number of people who tried to do it like the "greats" and failed.  When the denominator is high, it tells a much, much different story.
1530237768625971202 2022-05-27 17:21:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heybrandan Appreciate that, Brendan!

1530236048311308288 2022-05-27 17:14:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marktenenholtz Might not be too far from the truth.
1530236011497783298 2022-05-27 17:14:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj Thanks for spending your valuable time reading it, Louie.
1530235933387259906 2022-05-27 17:14:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD For certain. I'd recommend a phased approach, however.
1530232896069451776 2022-05-27 17:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 side hustles that you can grow past $100k:  1. Service-based business 2. Self-paced digital course 3. A paid, private community 4.

1530173651043205122 2022-05-27 13:06:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Headshots convey a specific emotion:   1. Fun 2. Playful 3. Confident 4. Powerful 5. Aggressive  What do you want yours to say? Then find someone who can make that happen.
1530173305021509633 2022-05-27 13:05:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Same. 57 at the present moment over 6 months.
1530173111101816832 2022-05-27 13:04:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches The best way to improve the likelihood of showing up is by creating systems that remove much of the friction. Good stuff, man.
1530172347931672576 2022-05-27 13:01:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito Thank you, Kelly!
1530172267354791936 2022-05-27 13:01:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Smart man :)
1530166612724269056 2022-05-27 12:38:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aidanxbriggs I love the weekends. One hour each weekend morning with zero distractions.
1530166513419821057 2022-05-27 12:38:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AKASpencerScott Very cool, Spencer.
1530166487561953280 2022-05-27 12:38:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Validation from someone doing it.
1530164236869058561 2022-05-27 12:29:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Martini_NFT 60 minutes per day over two years is the equivalent of working 90, 8-hour days. You can get a side hustle to a stable place with that effort.
1530164015783108609 2022-05-27 12:28:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jdubya001 Exactly.
1530163981582839808 2022-05-27 12:28:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eitan_levy101 For sure, Eitan.
1530163956651802624 2022-05-27 12:28:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi I don't know. Everyone has different lives and it would require a tremendous amount of context. But, generally, if you can't make money on your own, you need to find it somewhere.
1530161637969338368 2022-05-27 12:18:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @willcoombe Exactly. I'd rather make long-term strategic decisions with less pressure.
1530161527487139841 2022-05-27 12:18:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OzolinsJanis It's generally easiest (IMO).
1530161491101499394 2022-05-27 12:18:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ I like that, Matt!
1530161422344282112 2022-05-27 12:18:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkhundmiri Thanks, Mustafa.
1530161390144602113 2022-05-27 12:17:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ayushtweetshere Yep. Even if you get to 80%, you're in a better position.
1530161334792372224 2022-05-27 12:17:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zaafirsalam I think so too, Zaafir.
1530161302324363271 2022-05-27 12:17:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Yep. Less risk, more optionality.
1530161223722991619 2022-05-27 12:17:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneMike33 There are outliers in every situation for sure. I still believe that taking a phased approach is best.
1530160706607259648 2022-05-27 12:15:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Yep. Some people are wired to perform in that environment, but many others aren't.
1530160592983576577 2022-05-27 12:14:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mihir_narula I always found 30 in the AM and 30 in PM.
1530160514113982465 2022-05-27 12:14:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hendcm Always the long game.
1530160054019796992 2022-05-27 12:12:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship 101:  Don't quit your job and then start building your own business.  Find 60 minutes per day to work on your business and use your job as investment capital.   Once your business is paying your salary, then consider going all in.  Almost always a better choice.
1529955813367873536 2022-05-26 22:41:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Same goes for my online business. If I can learn it, apply it, and then use it many times over, it's worth it.
1529955580789530624 2022-05-26 22:40:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh I love that, Aadit. Damn. Adding to my Notion workspace as a reminder.
1529955253931614213 2022-05-26 22:38:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao "Practical and tactical" is my motto.
1529955158880313354 2022-05-26 22:38:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Congrats, man!
1529921510323933207 2022-05-26 20:24:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @sammarelich  https://t.co/7h7N29bYcm
1529912968175046679 2022-05-26 19:50:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jstnalmzn @TheJamesWillett Oh good! Just making sure it didn't come off that way.
1529906483290415104 2022-05-26 19:25:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJamesWillett @jstnalmzn I hope this didn't come across as 9 to 5 "hate".   That definitely wasn't my intention. I loved my 9 to 5 for 16 years.  I think it's worth discussing the downside of having no safety net though. And in order to do that, I think it's fair to point out the fragility of employment.
1529905949351325697 2022-05-26 19:22:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sammarelich Thank you so much, my man. That was a really fun call, and I think we landed on a solid strategic framework and excellent tactical steps.   Thanks for being so open and coachable.
1529858746947715072 2022-05-26 16:15:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks @dvassallo Daniel was the first person I started following deeply on Twitter and then built my business by simply listening, observing, and then executing on things I thought had a good chance of working.  3 years later, here I am.
1529857535213182976 2022-05-26 16:10:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Smart question, Hassan.
1529856649669771264 2022-05-26 16:07:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattgiaro I agree, Matt.
1529856624696999936 2022-05-26 16:06:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @3PillarsParent Smart preacher, Catherine.
1529856113335738370 2022-05-26 16:04:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zbijelic It's not easy to do, but if you take a step-by-step approach, it can be done. And I think the safety is worth the journey.
1529855407166050304 2022-05-26 16:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A lot of people are getting laid off.  This is the often-ignored fragility of being employed.  $80,000 salary one day. $0 the next.  This is why I champion the anti-fragile principles of diversified solopreneurship.
1529852400378470401 2022-05-26 15:50:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches I've had to have this same conversation with myself. It's a great mistake to learn from.
1529831463465627649 2022-05-26 14:26:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak People love to point out consistency, but consistency is often the result of recognizing that much of life is about persistence.
1529829219139829760 2022-05-26 14:18:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Growthmediaco Very, very, very few products sell themselves.

1529804549262917632 2022-05-26 12:40:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SyedHuq For sure. Nothing better than learning what people wan during your conversations.
1529802132676804609 2022-05-26 12:30:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches I changed my newsletter CTA from "Subscribe" to "Join 26k+ entrepreneurs" and conversions went 📈
1529800807129960448 2022-05-26 12:25:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jayyanginspires @collinnieman Smart man. Good image.
1529800654994165761 2022-05-26 12:24:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Appreciate that, Teddy.
1529800603387547649 2022-05-26 12:24:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Piyushscopy Exactly.

1529797502744109057 2022-05-26 12:12:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco Thank you, my man. 🙌
1529797014954835971 2022-05-26 12:10:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build a reputation before you build a product.  - Figure out who you love spending time with - Talk to them about their challenges - Learn how to truly solve them - Share what you learn daily - Repeat  This will lead to a wonderful reputation.  Then sell something.
1529796710410616832 2022-05-26 12:08:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @businessbarista I asked every reference to force rank a candidate's ability and then dig into the lowest-ranked skills.  I've found this to be a great way to really uncover problematic issues.

1529795817246162944 2022-05-26 12:05:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki The truest definition of failure is never starting.
1529594860478640130 2022-05-25 22:46:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NashSevereWx Any hail?
1529576849667416064 2022-05-25 21:35:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Hbd brother 🎂
1529493059930660865 2022-05-25 16:02:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I see a lot of solopreneurs working on their weaknesses instead of doubling down on their strengths.  Reverse it for maximum growth.
1529452408547557378 2022-05-25 13:20:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ @CoryGearrin Yep. Or Carrd + Stripe is really easy.
1529442806737031168 2022-05-25 12:42:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush It's like sending a bunch of salespeople into the vast internet world carrying your message. The payoff is incredible.
1529442743038136327 2022-05-25 12:42:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @renzil I'd start by creating attention. Getting discovered means the rest of the funnel becomes much easier over time.
1529442321430982657 2022-05-25 12:40:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Yep. Outlasting people is a strategy.
1529442241328074753 2022-05-25 12:40:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Yep. You stop getting "required reading" and start reading what you're passionate about.
1529441756261015552 2022-05-25 12:38:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Works well for creators too (and just about everything else)...
1529441345072467969 2022-05-25 12:36:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WrittenMastery 100%, Zaid.
1529441344837586944 2022-05-25 12:36:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danielakpobare For sure. Systems = consistency
1529439801472176129 2022-05-25 12:30:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj Correct. But I still push.
1529439766525231104 2022-05-25 12:30:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Have a consistent theme and become known for one thing.
1529439711219040256 2022-05-25 12:30:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Great ways to do it, Matt.
1529439674959273984 2022-05-25 12:30:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AngeZanetti Yep. That's mine. But if you want to go deeper than info products, you probably need a deeper funnel (IMO).
1529437661437562880 2022-05-25 12:22:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Solopreneur marketing funnel:  Discovery: Short-form content ↓ Trust: Newsletter/Podcast/YouTube ↓ Relationship building: Online community ↓ Service business: Advising/consulting/coaching ↓ Productized services: Digital courses/subscriptions

1529220634152415233 2022-05-24 21:59:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattnwalsh I wasn't suggesting they would, but I think they can.  I just meant the thought process behind diversification is important.  All VCs to founders: "Go hard on one thing!"  All VCs to themselves: "We have diversified our risk across many things."
1529219694753873920 2022-05-24 21:56:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Write for 30 minutes. Get those thoughts out!

1529183766115139586 2022-05-24 19:33:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heydannypeavey Definitely. Wasn't an exhaustive list, was just my streams. Services are amazing, especially if you can productize them after time.

1529141339279048706 2022-05-24 16:44:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your action:  7. How often are you sharing your opinions and work freely online?  8. When interesting opportunities come your way, are you seizing them?  9. Are you staying consistent and creating compound momentum?
1529141337383133185 2022-05-24 16:44:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your discipline:  4. Do you assume full responsibility for your life?  5. What changes have you made to help design a life with more intention?  6. What system(s) have you built for creating strong habits?
1529141335395115008 2022-05-24 16:44:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your purpose:  1. Do you truly appreciate time as currency?  2. What is your motivation for time freedom?  3. How have you curated an environment that supports your goal?
1529141332710764544 2022-05-24 16:44:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In Summary  The journey towards designing a life of intention never ends.  Here are the three groups and nine key drivers to always be improving, in the form of simple questions you can ask yourself ↓  https://t.co/sz4s4Q1Xaa
1529141325878247427 2022-05-24 16:44:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Undisciplined Creator  This is someone with motivation &amp; action but no discipline.  They share freely &amp; shine a spotlight on their work. But the success isn’t immediate.  Then they crumble. The world isn’t fair. Why should I change? I want to keep doing things my way.  https://t.co/Bwl6Zo7hry
1529141318563373056 2022-05-24 16:44:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Aimless Producer  This is someone with discipline that takes action, but they lack purpose.  They are heads down on work &amp; in competition with others. Moving full speed ahead.  They never stop to consider purpose, making it an unfulfilling hamster wheel with no end in sight.  https://t.co/fbBtkeZyfF
1529141311688826882 2022-05-24 16:44:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Passionate Dreamer  This is someone who understands their purpose &amp; has started to put in place discipline.  They talk often about recreating their lives. The challenge? They never start.  They can’t pull the trigger and they never move forward.   It becomes just a dream.  https://t.co/jH2hW6HaUO
1529141304776695811 2022-05-24 16:44:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Problem: Most people get 2 out of 3  When I speak with people who are attempting to design their life with more intention, they generally fall into the “2 out of 3” camp.  These are the 3 combinations that never seem to make it. ↓
1529141302998228992 2022-05-24 16:44:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Momentum  Momentum in life design is no different than momentum in business.  Creating &amp; seizing opportunity compounds over time, and compound work wins over short-term hacks.   When something works, double down.   When something fails, eliminate or iterate and try again.
1529141300762648577 2022-05-24 16:44:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Opportunity  Opportunity is one outcome of sharing your ideas.  It attracts other interesting thinkers.   Doing so will help you develop skills.   Use those skills to build assets, and those assets to create income.   With that income, you create more time. The cycle continues.
1529141287206764546 2022-05-24 16:44:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Change  Change means breaking away from the routine &amp; false comfort of the traditional system.  It means doing new &amp; interesting things with new &amp; interesting people.  Only when we extend our comfort zone can we truly grow.  The fishing is often best where the fewest go.
1529141285390622721 2022-05-24 16:44:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Ownership  Ownership is understanding that you are completely in control of your own life.  Nobody is coming to save you.  Yes, some people have it tougher, while others have it easier. This is factual.  But believing you don't have control fundamentally destroys the concept.
1529141276184125441 2022-05-24 16:44:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Environment  Your environment is what &amp; whom you surround yourself with.  Time and purpose like a seed, &amp; environment like soil &amp; water.   It’s tough to grow around pessimists, the unreliable, or untrustworthy.  Curating the right environment creates the ecosystem to thrive.
1529141269288652806 2022-05-24 16:44:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Motivation  Motivation is what drives you. Why are you creating time freedom?   If you’re creating it without specific motivation, it's likely that you will be unfulfilled.   The goal isn't to do nothing.   The goal is to avoid what you dislike and do more of what you love.
1529141263148236800 2022-05-24 16:44:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Time  We all know that time is our most finite resource.   The currency of life.   But we tend to forget when faced with the day-to-day work, family, and obligations.  Understanding that time is the ultimate currency is the fundamental driver of intentional life design.
1529141248849756160 2022-05-24 16:44:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your first reaction might be this sounds childlike or fantastical.   I’ve made peace with the potential judgment.  I believe it’s a more natural way to live than the assembly-line, 8-hour workday life we’ve inherited from the 1860s.  Let's start with 3 buckets ↓
1529141241090387970 2022-05-24 16:44:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> First, what does it mean to design an intentional life?  Here’s what I’ve landed on:  - Doing what I want, when I want, and with whom I want - Doing very little of what I don’t like &amp; more of what I do - Being free of traditional full-time employment - Having limited obligations
1529141233368670208 2022-05-24 16:44:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9 steps to designing a life of intention:  (and why most people fail)  🧵
1529125377418973185 2022-05-24 15:41:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FawazShak Everything is easier said than done.
1529122318202675207 2022-05-24 15:29:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cwcnicholas Focus on the 20% that matters.  Eliminate, automate or delegate all else.

1529118095201247232 2022-05-24 15:12:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh If the statement, “how we spend our days is how we spend our lives” is true, then habits are how we spend our days. Because better habits mean better days, then it’s not a stretch to believe they are a core driver of a better life.
1529117820415614976 2022-05-24 15:11:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Amazing what you can accomplish for free. Zero friction and incredibly high upside.

1529094587800866817 2022-05-24 13:38:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JackieOnBrand @JasonRBradwell Thanks!
1529094487624060928 2022-05-24 13:38:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DaniloKreimer I've certainly highlighted this many times.  Single Tweets should never be taken as business manuals.   They should be looked at as part of a large collection of contextual advice.
1529094196673531905 2022-05-24 13:37:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rajachirravuri @NandoCaralt @AliAbdaal 226 days.
1529094057229697029 2022-05-24 13:36:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulElijas I'd start with a service business because that helps influence everything else. You learn so much about your customer.  I don't wish I had started sooner. I am happy with the skills I picked up.
1529090756819959810 2022-05-24 13:23:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NandoCaralt @AliAbdaal I think people believe you just pop open Slack and you're ready to rock.  The reality is an incredible amount of customer service work, and probably 2x-3x more time than you ever even imagined.
1529090449801093122 2022-05-24 13:22:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IshBaid Because putting all of your eggs in one basket is almost never good advice in anything. Algorithm changes, market changes, platform changes, etc. all can impact a business. I'd rather diversify with light-lift, high potential options.
1529089775440994304 2022-05-24 13:19:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Don't slog through activities you hate only to find out they aren't in the 20% that even move the needle.
1529089542787108877 2022-05-24 13:18:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Clarity &gt; clever. Love Hemingway app for this.
1529089483299332096 2022-05-24 13:18:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Assume that whomever you are reaching out to has 100+ other people reaching out as well. Look through that lens when asking.
1529089304697380864 2022-05-24 13:17:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Most people's biggest enemy is themselves.
1529089030452822016 2022-05-24 13:16:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh This is why I don't spend any time reading about the morning routines of Jeff Bezos. I'd much rather just talk to someone who is a few steps above me on the ladder.
1529088882066829313 2022-05-24 13:16:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliAbdaal Not necessarily avoid, but I think people jump into building a community before fully understanding the work effort.
1529088718807646209 2022-05-24 13:15:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Codie_Sanchez Same here. I have had 57 impostors since October and they are scamming people out of money. Ridiculous that this is such a huge problem.
1529088445573959683 2022-05-24 13:14:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspujji If you can find both trust and complimentary skills, run fast at that person.
1529088177104904194 2022-05-24 13:13:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Help other people get better, and you'll ultimately get better as well.
1529088058246701056 2022-05-24 13:12:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Go deep and understand every nuance. Once you've mastered it, expand then. Slow and steady.
1529087853803753473 2022-05-24 13:12:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @creation247 Additional life hack: Find anyone who feels the complete opposite and spend zero time with them.
1529087203107913729 2022-05-24 13:09:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje I would, yes. Maybe tack on a community for course owners.
1529085326932725760 2022-05-24 13:02:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje I'm not sure that there is a perfect sequence, but I think starting with a service business helps you understand how to do the others more successfully.
1529084445252263936 2022-05-24 12:58:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theBMcopywriter It's the best thing I've ever done, Zohaib.
1529080003215900674 2022-05-24 12:40:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thiagofeysu #2 and #5 are both services, no?

1529074556077588480 2022-05-24 12:19:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Treat your career like a VC.  Build a portfolio of revenue streams, knowing one will hit big.  1. Courses 2. Coaching 3. Subscriptions 4. Paid community 5. Consulting &amp; advising  The diversified entrepreneur.

1528784214442881024 2022-05-23 17:05:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hermanvaswrites For sure, Herman.
1528784180754227200 2022-05-23 17:05:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NicolasHoferer Absolutely, Nicolas. Talk about the journey from negative present to positive future,
1528783601818644482 2022-05-23 17:03:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The very best marketers sell positive futures.
1528716949160706048 2022-05-23 12:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shaynmtl Love that.
1528716911550283787 2022-05-23 12:38:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mtamas5 @dagorenouf It doesn't have to be low revenue or high risk.
1528716802821394434 2022-05-23 12:37:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Same. I think of those years as investments in my business of today.
1528716756805615622 2022-05-23 12:37:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis It sure is, Teddy.
1528715411495190528 2022-05-23 12:32:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn @gumroad Thanks, Natalie!
1528715365265580034 2022-05-23 12:31:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj For certain.
1528715327806349315 2022-05-23 12:31:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TeshyT5 Anything worth doing is hard, sure.
1528715242921943040 2022-05-23 12:31:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @billydavies___ Don't compete on rate. Find your "why". Your competitive advantage.
1528712956959199232 2022-05-23 12:22:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj It's a win/win. You learn SO much.
1528712922716938243 2022-05-23 12:22:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mercyosaghai Nailed it, Mercy.
1528712441772789763 2022-05-23 12:20:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NicolasHoferer Yep. Productize your service then raise your service rates.
1528711157762113537 2022-05-23 12:15:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_baillee Agreed. Harder at first. Easier in the long run.
1528711076686221313 2022-05-23 12:14:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @navdeepsoni Thinking "quick money" is the worst way to head into anything.
1528710910122119169 2022-05-23 12:14:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @willcoombe I think so too.
1528710885694492674 2022-05-23 12:14:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv It's a bit tough to get started, but once you have momentum, the benefits seem to outweigh the risks as well.
1528710277671395328 2022-05-23 12:11:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you work for a company, you have professional skills.  Take those skills to the open market instead.  Sure, you'll have to make some noise and attract customers, but you'll charge 5x more than what you make at work.
1528419693849104386 2022-05-22 16:57:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ Thank you, KP! My goal is "practical and tactical."
1528393768860274688 2022-05-22 15:14:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wes_kao I love "show, don't tell".   When someone can actually show me the difference between negative present and positive future, it's incredibly impactful.
1528390736370073603 2022-05-22 15:02:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NicolasHoferer Thanks!
1528389131340025856 2022-05-22 14:55:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NicolasHoferer Mind reporting him?
1528384524534652928 2022-05-22 14:37:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NoelDavila I haven't. Maybe I'll give that a try. Thanks!
1528384439935545344 2022-05-22 14:37:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @autotrader87 Crypto scams.
1528383742057783299 2022-05-22 14:34:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NoelDavila @verified I don't qualify, unfortunately.
1528383643491749889 2022-05-22 14:33:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @separmeen Oh, I know, I was just saying I'm surprised that someone hasn't started a class action lawsuit yet.
1528382667527528449 2022-05-22 14:29:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JohnIsBuilding LOL
1528382607888621568 2022-05-22 14:29:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matthew_Fenton I have a file on my computer called "Twitter License" because I have to upload my driver's license every time I report these accounts.
1528382514263474176 2022-05-22 14:29:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @separmeen Sure, but when someone runs a scam under my name, it's probably lawsuit time.
1528382413822476289 2022-05-22 14:28:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tweetsbyejordan It's NON STOP.
1528382181348978690 2022-05-22 14:28:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RoisinPovall @elonmusk I hope someone can fix this dumpster fire.
1528382109034872833 2022-05-22 14:27:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ricardoclarke It's really annoying.
1528381527192657920 2022-05-22 14:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Just reported my 57th impostor in 5 months.   Twitter is an absolute mess.  https://t.co/uOGQhfU5cl
1528377360675913729 2022-05-22 14:08:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JohnIsBuilding For sure. But even "great" advice isn't always great, because it's highly contextual.
1528375402946781185 2022-05-22 14:01:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp Same for me.    Every person who thinks they "hate" me would probably feel differently if we had a beer and talked about life.   They'd find out quickly that I just want them to win.
1528374212112662535 2022-05-22 13:56:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexandraAllen_ Congrats! While you may not think it's much money, it's the beginning to a long, exciting, journey of building wealth on the internet. That's something to celebrate! 🎉

1528370237518782464 2022-05-22 13:40:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Yep, but the best advice comes from simply doing.
1528370170422513665 2022-05-22 13:40:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Figureoutability is #1 in nearly any job. A must.
1528366630413164548 2022-05-22 13:26:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The less predictable your career, the less helpful "how-to" advice is.   Becoming a lawyer has a pretty straight-line path.  Becoming an entrepreneur doesn't.  Don't blindly follow someone else's advice only to find out their luck isn't on your side.

1527703016257748998 2022-05-20 17:29:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson Give it a few issues. If it sucks, unsub :).
1527702963313065987 2022-05-20 17:29:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wardy0006 I dig this GIF.
1527696181001953281 2022-05-20 17:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A lot of good Tweets bomb.  And I see 4 copywriting mistakes that are to blame.  If you fix them, your Tweets have a much higher likelihood of success.  I'm going to cover all 4 tomorrow in my newsletter.  Get the issue fresh in your inbox at 8a CST:  https://t.co/vCOnWlle21
1527686136738549763 2022-05-20 16:22:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndreasGwosdz Amazing! Keep going, man.
1527635682965000199 2022-05-20 13:01:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd @LinkedIn Very interesting...Just shared in A&amp;I
1527633934686765057 2022-05-20 12:54:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti @davedoescopy So true.
1527633390198996993 2022-05-20 12:52:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd @LinkedIn Is this mobile or desktop?
1527631815539888128 2022-05-20 12:46:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Ahh. That's a great idea. Thanks, Teddy!
1527629731553853448 2022-05-20 12:38:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Correct. Plus, most people need to hear a core message hundreds of times before they'll act on it.,
1527629660275761153 2022-05-20 12:37:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luqmanux Yes sir.
1527629550506614785 2022-05-20 12:37:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daniel_nguyenx This is hilarious 😂
1527629001719783425 2022-05-20 12:35:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @getpaidwrite Yeah, that sounds boring!
1527628949177745415 2022-05-20 12:34:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Nailed it:  - Step-by-step - Observation - Past vs. present - Listicles - Contrarian thoughts - Comparisons - Teardowns
1527628201224200199 2022-05-20 12:31:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sairahul1 Glad it resonated, Rahul.

1527627802429775874 2022-05-20 12:30:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fitwithrashid It helps you speed up production while staying true to your message.
1527627745450242048 2022-05-20 12:30:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sarvamwriter Nice, Sarvam!
1527627730661134338 2022-05-20 12:30:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj Yep. And if you have 10, it gets wild.
1527627695575732234 2022-05-20 12:29:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ayushtweetshere I do this all of the time.
1527627302900727808 2022-05-20 12:28:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Denis__Shatalin It sure is tougher.
1527627266100015104 2022-05-20 12:28:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen Not in the structure, but maybe similar.
1527626516041027592 2022-05-20 12:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> An easy way to write more Twitter content:  1. Write a Tweet 2. Rewrite it in 5 different ways 3. Schedule it once per month for 5 months 4. Repeat.  Learn to say 1 thing 1,000 ways.
1527624308893405185 2022-05-20 12:16:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Thanks for the shoutout, my man!

1527437744188043264 2022-05-19 23:55:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luqmanux I don't think so, no.
1527437574435921923 2022-05-19 23:54:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexzecheru I hope that's a good thing?
1527437510162407429 2022-05-19 23:54:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shusmo Glad we could make it happen, and excited to see your business grow, my man. Cheers 🍻

1527360234812936213 2022-05-19 18:47:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How do you build a 7-figure business after burning out?  My conversation with @LisaNicoleBell pulls back the curtain on it.  We talked about:  - Transitioning from executive to entrepreneur - Designing an intentional life - Time management - And more   https://t.co/DN8FsQ5KzN  https://t.co/OLmTArtTy6
1527343338445164559 2022-05-19 17:40:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @paulcanetti Oh, for sure!
1527336132551139328 2022-05-19 17:11:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dbustac Thank you, sir. Right back at you.
1527334903335260161 2022-05-19 17:06:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcryptoyogi Heck yeah. Get after it!
1527334863308611606 2022-05-19 17:06:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @asatryan_v Boom!
1527334851589726226 2022-05-19 17:06:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pyewaw Start and keep going.
1527334829716430865 2022-05-19 17:06:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DenverNowicz Good job getting started though.
1527334802839330816 2022-05-19 17:06:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wordsy_aaina Thanks, Aaina.
1527334778717888514 2022-05-19 17:06:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yukti_sood Everything is saturated. Find your little corner of the internet and own it.
1527334706772992020 2022-05-19 17:05:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Varun_Bosmia True story.
1527334666339901451 2022-05-19 17:05:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CryptonianPrime We're all learning. That's the good news!
1527334633104236544 2022-05-19 17:05:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jameskonn Yep. 3 months from now you'll wonder why you didn't start earlier.
1527334577274253312 2022-05-19 17:05:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morgan_prakash Most good things are daunting!

1527334410294419457 2022-05-19 17:04:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @storymentor I like that, Derek.
1527334386815082496 2022-05-19 17:04:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoganBrownSWS Yep. Still...most people think about tomorrow instead of today.
1527334309279191043 2022-05-19 17:04:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Exactly, Dhruv. You got it...
1527334269785636869 2022-05-19 17:04:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Nailed it.
1527334156719788033 2022-05-19 17:03:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMoney_Wizard For sure. Start and don't stop.
1527334132958646274 2022-05-19 17:03:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ It almost never has your best interest in mind.
1527334077946159113 2022-05-19 17:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Just kick the ball forward.
1527331073251631122 2022-05-19 16:51:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In 10 years it won't matter if you started Tweeting here in 2018 or 2022.  The most important thing will be that you started.
1527317284876070914 2022-05-19 15:56:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Just crossed 25k today. I hope so! 100k my stretch goal. Thanks for the boost!
1527316090551824384 2022-05-19 15:51:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dbustac Thank you so much for the kind feature here, Daniel. Appreciate being featured with some legendary folks. 🙌
1527315459754061824 2022-05-19 15:49:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Damn. These are a bunch of professional, big-time newsletters and then there's my rinky-dink newsletter 😂  Thanks for including me with some giants, Alex!
1527290895833239557 2022-05-19 14:11:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yukti_sood Yep.
1527290850262253568 2022-05-19 14:11:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AshleighVoellin Heck yeah, Ashleigh. Thanks.

1527290490449559557 2022-05-19 14:10:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amzfreelancer @BlackLabelAdvsr It's desperate for creators. That's why the best creators on Twitter are now flooding LinkedIn.
1527290296521740291 2022-05-19 14:09:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amzfreelancer Haha. Probably.
1527290208588206080 2022-05-19 14:08:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamie_dru Yep. That's why it's become so easy to stand out if you do it the right way.
1527290116493914113 2022-05-19 14:08:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Of course!
1527290095656521729 2022-05-19 14:08:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Love that, Dave. So true.
1527272031271763968 2022-05-19 12:56:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @subhamshweta Exactly, Subham.
1527272025152266241 2022-05-19 12:56:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill It's the starting point for sure,.
1527271997247479808 2022-05-19 12:56:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Yep. Helping others achieve their wildest dreams will almost never go unnoticed.
1527271885075005442 2022-05-19 12:56:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis That's a damn good idea, Teddy.  Btw - pumped to see you crushing Twitter. Keep going, brother.
1527270928845004808 2022-05-19 12:52:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichaelJNovotny It's nearly impossible to fail when you show people how to reach their goals and become an integral part of helping them get there.
1527267490547568640 2022-05-19 12:38:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @5harath I agree 100%, Sharath.
1527267448092872705 2022-05-19 12:38:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Yep! #4 ensures people introduce you to other interesting people.
1527267326659284993 2022-05-19 12:38:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jayyanginspires This is your best one. I love it. NFT time.
1527264424897175552 2022-05-19 12:26:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew For sure. But establishing who you are, what you believe in, and how you think is critical.  I'd say hit "publish" on those thoughts and see who finds you. When they do, help them.
1527264280617357312 2022-05-19 12:25:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona 100%. The relationships are formed behind the scenes when you help other people.   Online is just like offline. I think some people forget about that.
1527263389738835971 2022-05-19 12:22:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hermanvaswrites It sure is. But helping them achieve their goals takes it to the next levle.
1527263389734641664 2022-05-19 12:22:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's exactly it. Karma growth.
1527263074171949058 2022-05-19 12:21:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Give to receieve.
1527262816540971013 2022-05-19 12:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to network:  1. Create content 2. Publish it into the world 3. Attract like-minded people  Most people get these steps right. It's the 4th step they miss.  4. Help them achieve their goals  That makes it fail-proof.

1526967991295942657 2022-05-18 16:48:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj Haha. I'm sure you can handle all of the sophistication and then some, Louie,.

1526958120173555712 2022-05-18 16:09:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wandergreed It sure does.
1526957324497301506 2022-05-18 16:06:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steve_P_Brady It's better than overly complex.

1526957154237829126 2022-05-18 16:05:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CeesJol99 Impulse buy pricing doesn't necessarily need every step (IMO) or the landing page takes care of the desire.

1526918920506064897 2022-05-18 13:33:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush If only everyone has listened sooner 😉  In all seriousness, if you can write well for Twitter there is a massive opp for you on LinkedIn.   Come join us.
1526902577425793027 2022-05-18 12:28:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adityatheverma Correct. It all starts with using your acquired skills to become an intrapreneur.
1526902492436504584 2022-05-18 12:28:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @swaycopy For sure. But gotta nail these 4 first.
1526900006011150336 2022-05-18 12:18:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sahilkhosla Yep. Start as an intrapreneur.
1526899923014324226 2022-05-18 12:18:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets 100%. Consider your employer your investor.
1526899868576391169 2022-05-18 12:17:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shannoncolon For sure. Look for the intersection between what you love and what clients tell you they want more of.  It all starts by interviewing your clients and interviewing yourself.
1526898608917856258 2022-05-18 12:12:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AnandButani Definitely. Anything good requires thoughtful decision-making.
1526898143757049857 2022-05-18 12:11:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kristofferryeng @testimonialto Thanks, man! :)
1526898102162051073 2022-05-18 12:10:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heywarco Thanks!
1526898066300846081 2022-05-18 12:10:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timduncaan Definitely good ideas, Tim.
1526897999854678018 2022-05-18 12:10:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @codejedii It took me 16 years because I spent the first 6 years screwing around.  Plus, the internet didn't exist in the same capacity it does today back when I entered the workforce.
1526896991564963843 2022-05-18 12:06:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DakeAkshay Thank you, Akshay. Good luck out there!
1526896161403064320 2022-05-18 12:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 phases of Solopreneurship:  Phase 1: Get paid to accumulate professional skills  Phase 2: Use those skills to solve workplace problems  Phase 3: Monetize those professional skills on the side  Phase 4: Use the earnings to go full-time solopreneur
1526722577149964290 2022-05-18 00:33:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @juancolamendy Thanks, man.
1526722176698798082 2022-05-18 00:31:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @conner_xyz @NotionHQ Ha. Just 2x walking. With 2 back surgeries, it's about all I can do anymore.

1526616194232553472 2022-05-17 17:30:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Same here, my man. It's easy to see your a systems guy simply because of your incredible production.
1526614088197062656 2022-05-17 17:22:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii 2022 is more about audience growth than promoting. Trying to think long term here.
1526613289916145667 2022-05-17 17:19:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito @dagorenouf I want to scale down, not up.
1526613228704473088 2022-05-17 17:18:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets For sure. Doesn't have to be my way. Whatever works :)

1526609202717855745 2022-05-17 17:02:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jameskonn @NotionHQ This is just generally how I operate best. I like to get my body moving in the morning, which helps me be more creative in the early afternoon.

1526606384795639808 2022-05-17 16:51:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fitwithrashid 100%. Highly recommend.
1526606327841230849 2022-05-17 16:51:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Appreciate that, Dhruv!
1526606254516359168 2022-05-17 16:51:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rehacks_ Thanks!
1526606169355210755 2022-05-17 16:50:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lexpaval With such an interesting network, I want to make sure that I remember to reach out and support regularly.   The 13-week thing helps for sure.
1526605961984712704 2022-05-17 16:49:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge @JamesClear Appreciate you, my man. Thank you. 🙌
1526605854442721282 2022-05-17 16:49:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Same here. As I grew, I started to get disorganized. Notion saved me.
1526605762818187265 2022-05-17 16:49:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WealthProfits It's such a great tool...

She's been absolutely amazing and saved me nearly 40 hours per month.  Here's our system for working together:   https://t.co/vSs0DF5BrV
1526604536927985665 2022-05-17 16:44:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotionHQ @TwemexApp @SaveToNotion @hypefury @harrydry 5/ Networking System  Keeping up with people isn't easy.  Sure, my best friends &amp; I talk weekly.   But I want to touch base (and support) others I've gotten to know. So, I created a quarterly reminder.  Every 13 weeks, I reach out to 20+ people to see if I can help in some way.  https://t.co/3jq2dI6s5j

Part of my 2023 plan is to install a best in class promotion system for my business.  I'm going to start by following this one from @harrydry at MarketingExamples.   https://t.co/YmgFZPq1HS
1526604518074503170 2022-05-17 16:44:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotionHQ 3/ Content Creation System  I use a 4-step content creation system to produce rapidly:  - Step 1: Curate - Step 2: Create - Step 3: Templatize - Step 4: Distribute  I use a combination of @TwemexApp + @SaveToNotion + @hypefury to execute on the plan.
1526604514337378304 2022-05-17 16:44:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotionHQ 2/ Time Blocking System  GCal + Calendly makes sure I never book something in the wrong spot.  - Mornings: Workout &amp; Engagement on social - Early afternoon: Creativity and writing - Late afternoon: coaching &amp; meetings  I set up custom availability for everything.  https://t.co/8zeYC75g3E
1526604503172239362 2022-05-17 16:44:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Knowledge Management System  Everything you know or need to reference should be stored in one place.

1526581332544987137 2022-05-17 15:12:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SriDwantoPinuji Yep!
1526580926439989251 2022-05-17 15:10:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iLucaMicheli NICE!

1526580720059265025 2022-05-17 15:09:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh @austinbelcak Love to see it :)
1526580677600239616 2022-05-17 15:09:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mrobertsmktg Nope. I have about 3-5 people in my ecosystem that I try to engage with daily.
1526580550688985089 2022-05-17 15:09:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @endamacnally I just picked a day (Tuesday - see you at 11:44a CST) and stuck to it for the most part. I miss sometimes, but that's just human nature.
1526580373123125249 2022-05-17 15:08:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeorgeSiosi Yep. I've never Tweeted more, that's for sure.
1526580333965090816 2022-05-17 15:08:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichaelNatelli This is the only thing I've done since the beginning, but, as usual, what works for me may not work for you.  I'd recommend experimenting and testing to see what really helps. The answers are always in the data.
1526580172115386369 2022-05-17 15:07:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timduncaan I'm not sure. Experiment and see if this works for you, but give it time.
1526550540158640128 2022-05-17 13:09:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eladdio Yep, for sure. It's my job though. So that makes it easier.
1526549288502939649 2022-05-17 13:04:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Codishaa Went from 8k to 101k followers, and my business has grown from roughly 800k per year to about 1.5M per year.
1526549121963802624 2022-05-17 13:04:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GregHlavaty Twitter and LinkedIn really aren't that different when you break them down.  1. Teach 2. Entertain 3. Challenge 4. Empathize  Most content isn't very good on LI, but that actually makes it easier to stand out if you can create high-quality content.
1526548479098626048 2022-05-17 13:01:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @espressocopy Yeah, it's a great question to ponder. Things change so frequently, that tactical advice (from anyone) becomes outdated.  My thought it just keep producing and everything should correct itself.
1526548171094118401 2022-05-17 13:00:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bbourque 😀

1526542821200744449 2022-05-17 12:39:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Thanks, Matt!
1526542801604943872 2022-05-17 12:39:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis You can't get to everyone, especially once you have hundreds of thousands of followers.  It's a bummer, but just the reality.
1526541852878458881 2022-05-17 12:35:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WealthProfits Use a content matrix.  One side with topics. One side with formats.  Mix and match.
1526541827645620224 2022-05-17 12:35:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thetrunkgym Keep going, Coach.
1526541800353189890 2022-05-17 12:35:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yukti_sood I think so yes.
1526541762159861761 2022-05-17 12:34:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jayyanginspires Dude, this is awesome.
1526541718073528320 2022-05-17 12:34:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @connectABTweets I spend about 45-60 minutes per day.
1526541687929114627 2022-05-17 12:34:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamie_dru Good luck, my man.
1526541663191150593 2022-05-17 12:34:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh Love this, Harsh!
1526540301879361539 2022-05-17 12:29:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD I do, but altered to be platform relevant.
1526540190956781570 2022-05-17 12:28:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Anywhere between 2-4 weeks usually.
1526540143909281792 2022-05-17 12:28:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichePriest Don't overdo it. Keep it manageable and you're more likely to stick with it.
1526540045024473088 2022-05-17 12:28:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @espressocopy Honestly, when I moved from 1x to 2x, I just started growing 2x as fast.  Doesn't necessarily mean it works every time, but it's working for me, so thought it made sense to share.  Interesting to hear your side though for sure.
1526539826954178563 2022-05-17 12:27:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Chadmgreenlee So glad to hear that, Chad!
1526539437789917184 2022-05-17 12:25:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @therahmanashiq 8-12 depending on creativity level.
1526539294340423682 2022-05-17 12:25:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DarpanJain It would be much, much, much less effective, IMO.
1526539248257708032 2022-05-17 12:24:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Christian_rson Thanks, Christian.
1526539226845675521 2022-05-17 12:24:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YannBrds It's certainly not easy.
1526539168708538371 2022-05-17 12:24:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yodunbar Nice, Christian!
1526539144461176832 2022-05-17 12:24:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iammosesaboh For sure, Moses.
1526539113968676865 2022-05-17 12:24:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WealthProfits It's tough. Build out systems that improve likelihoods.
1526539054078214144 2022-05-17 12:24:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adammarx13 @austinbelcak It's difficult, for sure. Lots of people can't find time or don't want to play the game...that's understandable.
1526538958938701827 2022-05-17 12:23:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv For sure, Dhruv. It's called "social" media.
1526537833787314176 2022-05-17 12:19:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My social media strategy:   Tweets: 2x per day Threads: 1x per week LinkedIn posts: 2x per day Weekly Newsletter: 1x per week  Then, each day I spend about 45 minutes interacting with my audience.  Do this for 6 months and watch what happens.
1526336166680731648 2022-05-16 22:57:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshLindblom52 I built out a calendar that helps me stay on track with deep vs. wide and educational vs. challenging, etc.

1526248923744161792 2022-05-16 17:11:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KevinKellyUSA @StephenKing There are outliers in nearly everything, but I don't know enough about his criticisms to understand the comment.
1526248666427805702 2022-05-16 17:10:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NextToWealth For sure.
1526248646894833664 2022-05-16 17:10:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fritzvdw You realize how hard it is, and how criticizing others who are trying no longer makes sense in the mind.
1526248560542507010 2022-05-16 17:09:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsedaxe Same here. I'll never criticize someone trying.
1526248521883697152 2022-05-16 17:09:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Aidarousheikh Exactly, Aidarous.
1526248495442698242 2022-05-16 17:09:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ProBoDotCo I've found this to be 110% true.
1526248458511958017 2022-05-16 17:09:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ross_davies Totally, Ross.
1526248436512788483 2022-05-16 17:09:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luqmanux Ain't it though?
1526248410101305344 2022-05-16 17:09:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge FACTS
1526248360415481856 2022-05-16 17:09:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt That's how I think about it, Danny.
1526248328110952448 2022-05-16 17:08:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ayushtweetshere Yet, we live in a world of a million critics.
1526248277611532288 2022-05-16 17:08:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caitmackcs I don't. I'm Dikembe Mutombo on here.
1526247485810827270 2022-05-16 17:05:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertbalazsi Ha. I'm not super familiar. Haven't spent much time there.
1526247399857000449 2022-05-16 17:05:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EmilioDiMarco2 That's why most people default to criticism.
1526247333360504833 2022-05-16 17:04:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare For sure...
1526246929419669506 2022-05-16 17:03:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The people who criticize the most, create the least.
1526231298238455808 2022-05-16 16:01:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 This is a dope thread. Even after a ton of course sales, I've bookmarked this as a checklist for my landing pages.  Thanks for this, dude.
1526230750881800195 2022-05-16 15:59:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Thank you, my man :)
1526230709274394627 2022-05-16 15:58:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CPASuperHero No, I've had my Twitter account since 2009. I never Tweeted regularly until October of 2021. I tried before, but it was sparse, and I just ended up giving up each time.  Something about this last try has been different.
1526217110946553856 2022-05-16 15:04:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp The biggest "hack" is doing good work for a long time. Weird, huh? :)
1526216952011685891 2022-05-16 15:04:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brianbeers Consistent and linear followed by some nice spikes.
1526216869044183040 2022-05-16 15:03:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Thank you, Alex. The same to you, man.
1526208376459382784 2022-05-16 14:30:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ I used to think that Twitter should be used like a microphone. One to many.  What I've come to realize is that it's more of a networking event than I ever thought.  So, building strong relationships has led to better growth than just writing "at" people.
1526208049379258373 2022-05-16 14:28:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamie_dru @chrisxmunn Appreciate you, Jamie!
1526207989190955010 2022-05-16 14:28:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adam_crates Yes, for sure.
1526207890712932356 2022-05-16 14:28:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CooperKraussKC That's the key right there, Cooper.
1526207853798752256 2022-05-16 14:28:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GrammarHippy Love that addition, George. Noted.
1526207797037355011 2022-05-16 14:27:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachcapshaw Ha. I appreciate that, Zach.
1526207746173026307 2022-05-16 14:27:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @will_b_cameron Just people I find interesting for the most part.
1526207684986421249 2022-05-16 14:27:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill Appreciate it, Barrett!
1526207650400284674 2022-05-16 14:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarrisFanaroff Yep. The execution is the hard part.
1526207609845563394 2022-05-16 14:27:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mountainsnmoney Get started, stay consistent, and you will.
1526207542283599873 2022-05-16 14:26:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Appreciate you, my man. Looking fwd to connecting later today.
1526207473413136389 2022-05-16 14:26:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAndBooks_ Thanks, dude! Just tryin' to catch you over here 😉
1526207409659715584 2022-05-16 14:26:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Haha. Right, Dave?
1526207384015839236 2022-05-16 14:26:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_rubiopaty Thanks, Patricia!
1526187395447762944 2022-05-16 13:06:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoganBrownSWS Linear in the beginning, more exponential as I got further and further along.
1526187278242029568 2022-05-16 13:06:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Thank you, man!
1526187106997084162 2022-05-16 13:05:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jimmymoncrief I do. I write ahead of time and use @hypefury for automated publishing.
1526183591792848900 2022-05-16 12:51:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vinikloppel People want "hacks" and "tricks" when mostly it's just simplicity that's key.
1526181871901605889 2022-05-16 12:44:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @linwoodschulman Yes. My business revenue is set to grow about 60% this year.
1526180604404015112 2022-05-16 12:39:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Yeah, I remember that actually, Jack.  I don't know if this helps, but 10% of people will hate you no matter what you write/do/say.  I just block and move on. My content is not a democracy.
1526180309045235713 2022-05-16 12:38:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thetrunkgym Definitely. It's not easy. But think of it as a long-game play.
1526180132989423616 2022-05-16 12:37:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_Vault_Security Welcome!
1526180105239908352 2022-05-16 12:37:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JacWida Basically.
1526180085199523840 2022-05-16 12:37:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heavyjab I don't want to write daily threads, so for me, yes. For you? Depends on what you feel comfortable doing and how it resonates with your audience.  It's about what your audience tells you, not necessarily what I think.
1526179888318795779 2022-05-16 12:36:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jappleby Threads for sure.   But I don't think those threads would have given me the same results had I not built relationships with other creators.  Sometimes (not always) you get lucky and they RT you and that's where the biggest jumps happen.
1526179549251248128 2022-05-16 12:35:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Appreciate it, Greg.
1526179530049785856 2022-05-16 12:35:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jayyanginspires Thank you, Jay.
1526179509250277376 2022-05-16 12:35:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Commenting. Sometimes leads to DMs, but commenting works best for me.
1526179437359910912 2022-05-16 12:35:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thetrunkgym For me, it's mostly just comments. Sometimes those turn into DMs, but I never cold DM people. There has to be a reason.
1526179258892165122 2022-05-16 12:34:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WillFlindall On Twitter or anywhere?
1526179146988134402 2022-05-16 12:33:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaronmmota For sure. It's no secret hack. Just consistency and improvement over time.
1526178965018255362 2022-05-16 12:33:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlOftebro Thanks for reading them, Karl.

1526178829785513984 2022-05-16 12:32:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dsvaughncsp Thanks, Scott!
1526178798806487041 2022-05-16 12:32:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timduncaan No right answer other than what you learn from your specific audience.
1526178723401195520 2022-05-16 12:32:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copywithkush Pick people you're inspired by or would love to get to know more deeply.
1526178672834748416 2022-05-16 12:32:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AngeZanetti I'd rather keep it small and meaningful.
1526178628425371651 2022-05-16 12:31:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heychazza I don't know. I don't know what you do, who you help, or what you help them do.
1526178519323140097 2022-05-16 12:31:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ For sure, Matt!
1526177199753203715 2022-05-16 12:26:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I’ve Tweeted 217 days in a row.  And added 93k+ followers.  Here are 4 simple lessons learned:  1. Share one useful tip each morning. 2. Comment under large accounts. 3. Engage with 3-5 people daily. 4. Write 1 thread per week.  That's it.  Hope that's helpful.
1525866708241727490 2022-05-15 15:52:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn @jspector Just admin, gatekeeping, and customer service for the most part.
1525864916325961729 2022-05-15 15:45:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Thank you, man! :)
1525863053727830017 2022-05-15 15:37:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn @jspector Nope! Just a VA. I think of my content as my marketing "team".
1525855573153046531 2022-05-15 15:08:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Praadigi @dvassallo Thanks!

1525827839035064320 2022-05-15 13:17:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jlcossi Sounds about right.
1525827818197745666 2022-05-15 13:17:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Get after it, Matt.
1525827796064419840 2022-05-15 13:17:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoganBrownSWS It really is, Logan. Deliver value. Learn. Iterate. Repeat.
1525827730893377536 2022-05-15 13:17:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Nailed it. This is it.
1525825893150728193 2022-05-15 13:10:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsedaxe It sure does, Ed.
1525825029916831745 2022-05-15 13:06:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship isn't about a great idea.  It's about attracting people &amp; delivering.  Average idea + great marketing + quality delivery = a viable business  Today's a great day to start.

1525098452744552448 2022-05-13 12:59:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayclouse I loved Dishoom in London. Amazing Indian food.

1525093747121393664 2022-05-13 12:40:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KusshalPatel Love that quote.

1524076376738967553 2022-05-10 17:18:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sushilganesh17 I generally don't publish to marketplaces because I like to maximize my profit.

1524075516696965133 2022-05-10 17:14:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj The more complex someone makes something, the more likely they are to benefit from your confusion.

1524067852059348993 2022-05-10 16:44:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1524067849031061507 2022-05-10 16:44:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> - No 30-day email course. - No complicated integrations. - No audience segmentation. - No abandoned cart emails.  None of these things are bad btw.   They would probably help me increase sales.  But they aren't necessary to start &amp; be successful.  So I hope you'll get started.
1524067845499494400 2022-05-10 16:44:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Create an army of affiliates  After completing the course, customers receive an invite to become an affiliate.  I pay out 35% vs. the standard 20%-25%.  This has led to $15,000 in revenue in just the last 3 months.  Not bad for no work.  https://t.co/GNOJfodFXX
1524067830353862660 2022-05-10 16:44:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Automate testimonials  When the course is completed, I embed a Testimonial capture inside of the last lesson.  The ask is simple. A quick video or text testimonial.  Then it automatically gets added to my landing page.  Check it out:  https://t.co/1OiZqvaPot
1524067823047303169 2022-05-10 16:44:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Deliver 100x value  Part of the "impulse buy" strategy is to surprise and delight the customer.  "The best investment I have made in the last year" - Dominika Vasova  This is the kind of feedback I'm after 👆🏻  https://t.co/9ZGEytGyTf
1524067813140406273 2022-05-10 16:44:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Create urgency with discounts  A simple 25% to 35% expiring discount (24 hours only!) drives purchases.  A well-crafted ask + impulse pricing + expiring deal = 💰  I average about $14k in 24 hours when I ask.   It gets seen by 80k to 120k people.
1524067804022030336 2022-05-10 16:44:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ "Impulse buy" pricing  The amount of trust you need to sell a $979 masterclass is insane.  When people come across my products (especially on "ask" days), I want them to "pull the trigger" without thinking.  Make it easy.  $100 to $150 is my sweet spot.  https://t.co/jF45x69WBo
1524067787097968640 2022-05-10 16:44:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Ask 10%-20% of the time  As you continue giving away valuable information, you earn the right to make an "ask".  Once per week, I ask my audience to buy something.  I make about 15x the revenue each "ask day".  You can see this playing out in my sales below.  https://t.co/zhbeqybFQm
1524067774905073664 2022-05-10 16:44:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Deliver daily value in a niche  I've spent 3 years on social media talking about audience &amp; business growth.  All of my best lessons already exist as content. They are literally all free.  The good news is people will pay for aggregation.  So give freely.

1524006943320334336 2022-05-10 12:42:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jacob_JLS Yep. Not everything is fun and games. But the outcome is if you're consistent.

1524006558094475264 2022-05-10 12:40:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoganBrownSWS Yep. Boring and simple, but never easy.  I'm just trying to outlast everyone.
1524003239116554241 2022-05-10 12:27:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sarleryd Yep. The results are exciting.
1524002454295175176 2022-05-10 12:24:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sushilganesh17 For sure. Not everything is boring.
1524002412947820544 2022-05-10 12:24:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertbalazsi For sure, Robert.
1524002390839631873 2022-05-10 12:24:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Daniel_Nyi Definitely. Building something meaningful isn't always exciting.

1524002139705597953 2022-05-10 12:23:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TechLeaderPro Oh, for sure.

1524001079104581635 2022-05-10 12:19:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Success is often the result of boring consistency applied to the right things.

1523770215095750656 2022-05-09 21:01:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmikolay The Naval part is something I think about a lot.   Curiosity takes care of nearly everything else. If you're curious, you will likely figure it out. If you figure it out, you will likely win.
1523765790939676672 2022-05-09 20:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcust86550577 I'm not sure. I don't do much with holistic health so you're much better off asking your ideal customer. Whatever they tell you will be much better than what I tell you.

1523714549140307968 2022-05-09 17:20:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tweetsbyejordan Definitely. Be kind to others. Karma is real.
1523714504290279425 2022-05-09 17:20:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomfallowfield Ha.
1523714478394966021 2022-05-09 17:20:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @feelthebyrn1 Thank you, Gordo. That means a lot!
1523714427228688384 2022-05-09 17:20:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiharikaSodhi It's such a great feeling to bring people on your journey.
1523714366700367874 2022-05-09 17:19:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jameskonn 100%, James.
1523714344311488512 2022-05-09 17:19:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Damn, that's some smart thinking there. Loved the way it's phrased. Thanks for sharing.
1523714256092692482 2022-05-09 17:19:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ It certainly is, man.
1523710168407719938 2022-05-09 17:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Entrepreneurship so often feels like a Karma game.  I'm convinced that helping others over the course of your career is the single greatest investment you can make.  Those that succeeded without this are the exception, not the rule.
1523685055922868224 2022-05-09 15:23:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeYing77 I picked advising early stage SaaS companies in the healthcare vertical.
1523654747169132544 2022-05-09 13:22:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ownit_Fran Boom.
1523654747139411968 2022-05-09 13:22:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KushShah9492 Yep. It's not necessarily grinding, but definitely playing the long game.
1523654685353463809 2022-05-09 13:22:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiharikaSodhi That's the fun part. It is!  Wait until 5 years from now...
1523651407215476737 2022-05-09 13:09:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gauravsingh961 Once I truly and deeply understood how to solve specific common problems my customers encounter. Then, I'd attempt to solve them in less than 60 minutes via a course.
1523647171068710916 2022-05-09 12:52:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caitmackcs I ask every single time. Easiest way. $0 acquisition cost.
1523644739274539009 2022-05-09 12:43:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj Basically :)
1523644701253185538 2022-05-09 12:42:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoganBrownSWS Just gotta get creative. There is money to be made everywhere.
1523643576374087680 2022-05-09 12:38:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj For sure. This is just one way of many different ways to get started.
1523642106698362880 2022-05-09 12:32:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theNickFriend Definitely an awesome way as well.
1523642041326247936 2022-05-09 12:32:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yassenshopov I'd ask for intros from the companies I helped for free.
1523640451462582274 2022-05-09 12:26:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If I had to start my solopreneur journey over, here's what I'd do:  - Pick a skill I know cold - Talk about it daily online - Offer to help 3 companies free - Track meaningful improvements - Get a few testimonials for my website - Ask for intros to other companies &amp; charge $$$

1523339819065417728 2022-05-08 16:31:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp Weak.   I’m in Oaxaca, Mexico and the charcuterie game is on point (and only $3)  https://t.co/19fBZmv01U
1523295962873143296 2022-05-08 13:37:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zaafirsalam Try a bunch of things and see what resonates. Then double down!
1523294053613568000 2022-05-08 13:29:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @I___DEREKflint Yep. It's both art and science. You have to actually have an outcome in mind usually.
1523293974827569153 2022-05-08 13:29:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rainar_angelo For certain!
1523293945790607362 2022-05-08 13:29:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zaafirsalam Writing on Twitter IS building your audience organically.
1523292662534742019 2022-05-08 13:24:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theahmedemiola Great, Ahmed!
1523292569295372288 2022-05-08 13:23:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeYing77 It's a good question. I think the other 5 can be paramount when building a sustainable business online.
1523292242794135552 2022-05-08 13:22:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide I try to get a "yes" to all 6.
1523291851645943809 2022-05-08 13:20:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj Thanks, Omara!
1523291822197710848 2022-05-08 13:20:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv A lot of people struggle with that, so hopefully these 6 q's will be helpful.
1523291689024356352 2022-05-08 13:20:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @teaceoo I don't worry about grammar or spelling usually. Mistakes are human.
1523291305585123328 2022-05-08 13:18:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6 questions I ask when writing content:  1. Is this related to my niche? 2. Is this a unique viewpoint? 3. Is this content easy to read? 4. Does it create a conversation? 5. Would I have stopped to read this? 6. Does this teach, entertain, or challenge?
1523100563029770240 2022-05-08 00:40:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @gregisenberg @Julian Appreciate it man!

1522981193112772609 2022-05-07 16:46:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregisenberg Great thread, Greg. I went the course route and confirm it’s a great way to make your living (or extra income). Bolt on a community, then build a Micro-SaaS that helps people reach goals in the course.
1522969618876452866 2022-05-07 16:00:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj @Nicolascole77 Thank you so much!

1522933321700888576 2022-05-07 13:36:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis I think so too. So many creators I talk to, talk about unscalable things. Especially in the beginning.
1522933150338404352 2022-05-07 13:35:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Insane thread, Dave. Nice work! And glad I could be a tiny sliver in your journey. Appreciate you, man.

1522586951513264128 2022-05-06 14:39:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imThomasMorales Added Twitter!
1522579754951622657 2022-05-06 14:11:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MJCrandall This is just LI and Twitter. Would be significantly higher if it were my newsletter as well.
1522577800821100545 2022-05-06 14:03:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theorencohen_ 3-4 weeks usually. Sometimes less, sometimes more.
1522573352015220738 2022-05-06 13:45:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak The more clickbait stuff that's out there, the easier it is for long-game players out there.
1522568160158928897 2022-05-06 13:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj I hope those are true 🙂

1522567942499614728 2022-05-06 13:24:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timduncaan Twitter and LinkedIn. If I added in my newsletter it would be significantly higher.
1522564961309974528 2022-05-06 13:12:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Ha. Love that, man.
1522563443550826496 2022-05-06 13:06:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush 3 great prompts. Loving the atomic essay look here from Typeshare. Very cool way (and different) way to pack a lot of info into a Tweet, rather than using a thread.
1522562642568785920 2022-05-06 13:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlKaufmanADI Oh for sure! I'm an investing junkie.

1522559497432178690 2022-05-06 12:50:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv I'm definitely not, but appreciate it!
1522558111147601921 2022-05-06 12:45:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A writing journey:  2018: 700k impressions 2019:  9M impressions 2020: 23M impressions 2021: 38M impressions 2022: 225M impressions (projected)  It's not about more. It's about how it compounds.  Start today &amp; you'll be thankful over the next 5 years.
1522264182644744192 2022-05-05 17:17:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Amazing thread. I love me some new tools. ❤️
1522245272419680256 2022-05-05 16:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> All those questions you have about solopreneurship get answered when you just start.
1522203046134140934 2022-05-05 13:14:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_bigfield Thanks for the mention, Victor. Much appreciated.
1522200223380033538 2022-05-05 13:03:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @misterparker Yep. Grew one from $0 to over $70M in ARR in about 5 years as the CRO.
1522194933100253185 2022-05-05 12:42:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imjameskonn Writing.
1522194917208080386 2022-05-05 12:42:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eran_dror Also a great move!
1522194860261969921 2022-05-05 12:41:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JorisFalter Same. I'm most creative then.
1522194816452513793 2022-05-05 12:41:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OliverJones_19 Systems often help keep that motivation moving forwardd.
1522194716779024384 2022-05-05 12:41:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Thanks, Luke!
1522194697967607809 2022-05-05 12:41:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisisming Depends on what you're checking in on, to be honest. If I'm looking at social growth, I'm checking weekly to see how I'm improving.
1522194524663128064 2022-05-05 12:40:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gauravsingh961 I think so too, Gaurav.
1522194441649504256 2022-05-05 12:40:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeYing77 Correct. Systems lead to outcomes.
1522194373487869953 2022-05-05 12:39:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's exactly it, Dhruv.
1522189388561670144 2022-05-05 12:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship isn't about time, it's about discipline.  - Big goals - Check-in points - Daily action steps  My calendar is 40% regimented and 60% flexible.  Regimented for consistent achievement. Flexible for new opportunities.

1521986768458891269 2022-05-04 22:54:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency Love when you ship good sh*t, Dylan. Keep going, brother.
1521986093633228801 2022-05-04 22:52:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matthew55648341 I think one of the biggest lessons in life is that we learn the most when we do.   It took me 30 years to realize it.

1521970904909111296 2022-05-04 21:51:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @William3Willis Congrats!!
1521925660272431108 2022-05-04 18:52:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SyedHuq @thedankoe Awesome! Thanks man.
1521890077051400192 2022-05-04 16:30:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaronhayslip @amandanat Templates and copy/paste are very different things.
1521883413556432901 2022-05-04 16:04:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ Great stuff, KP. Thanks for including me. I feel honored, my man.
1521882917345112066 2022-05-04 16:02:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build in public as a solopreneur.  Worst case?  You fail and have an insane digital resume.
1521880063116992516 2022-05-04 15:50:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sajjanbalar Correct. A person helping me out virtually.
1521878930487193601 2022-05-04 15:46:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAMIDarlington @amandanat This wins the internet today. I love it. Thank you for the good laugh.
1521878771397271553 2022-05-04 15:45:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thcmpny_ @amandanat Haha.
1521878529696313353 2022-05-04 15:44:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amandanat @seempaq I won't share who it is, because one day when he least expects it, I'm gonna f*ck up his world 😀
1521878290251845636 2022-05-04 15:43:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amandanat I commented on one of his posts and then just blocked him. I get plagiarized, word-for-word, every single day on LinkedIn, and weekly on Twitter.  People can steal the content, but they can't steal the journey.
1521876327950958595 2022-05-04 15:36:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @seempaq @amandanat A popular Twitter marketing account (Amanda follows him) once asked me to explain my distribution process on Loom.  I did.  15 minutes later, he stole it step-for-step and sent it out as a thread to promote his new newsletter.
1521874974570655744 2022-05-04 15:30:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amandanat That's a bummer. I recently found out a guy from Italy was plagiarizing every single thing I wrote, but just translated it to Italian. 😂  Ballsy.
1521873521995100160 2022-05-04 15:24:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 This is why the world is full of poor academics and rich criminals.
1521870007688437762 2022-05-04 15:10:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp @clintavo @girdley I've been to Madrid, Lisbon, London, Edinburgh, and Oaxaca in the last 60 days.   I see less than 10% of folks on the flight wearing a mask, but this is probably because I'm in Nashville.   I'd hypothesize that it's much higher out of LAX or JFK.
1521869575259930626 2022-05-04 15:09:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @clintavo @girdley @JamesonCamp I'm on a flight to Oaxaca, Mexico at the moment. Feels so good to be traveling continuously again.
1521864892168515585 2022-05-04 14:50:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp See the very same thing. Astute observation.
1521831084668956677 2022-05-04 12:36:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CMwritesalot Well done!
1521831022966591488 2022-05-04 12:36:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisBadgett Love that, Chris. 🔥
1521830974996324352 2022-05-04 12:35:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh Nice work, Harsh.
1521830609416597504 2022-05-04 12:34:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP 100%, Greg. A missed opp so often.
1521830536410456066 2022-05-04 12:34:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realjefflarge In service businesses, there is usually multiple options to consider, so I think honing in on the "why us/me" part of it is critical.
1521830341102772224 2022-05-04 12:33:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @prestesonline I agree with you for sure on this. So many unclear landing pages.
1521830244159827968 2022-05-04 12:32:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CraigtoCreate Exactly, Craig.
1521830204192272384 2022-05-04 12:32:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @espressocopy Really good stuff, Chris. I appreciate you sharing that.
1521830132410953735 2022-05-04 12:32:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OanaLeonte2 Part of the copy for sure. The why usually gets them to the offer. The offer generally needs to describe the transformation.
1521829999413714945 2022-05-04 12:32:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen For sure, Oscar.
1521829953893023745 2022-05-04 12:31:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv 100% Dhruv.
1521829927271772162 2022-05-04 12:31:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Tell me more.
1521829874524172289 2022-05-04 12:31:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi For sure.
1521829851581321219 2022-05-04 12:31:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Exactly. Not features. Transformations.
1521827807403335680 2022-05-04 12:23:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Online Course Marketing 101:  Your offer should answer, "What, exactly, will customers achieve?"  It's not: "Learn how to invest in the market."  It's: "In 1 hour, you'll learn to invest your first $10k in the market without an expensive advisor."  Outcome clarity is critical.
1521823494924812289 2022-05-04 12:06:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii @_MetaProperties @amandanat @RobinNYC @blakeaburge @barrettjoneill @thesamparr @ShaanVP @SOLBigBrain @aaditsh @realEstateTrent Thanks man!

1521657510784024577 2022-05-04 01:06:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Of course, man!

1521640613652967425 2022-05-03 23:59:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @petesena Really enjoying Zirtual.
1521640290536275969 2022-05-03 23:58:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @willstew @jspector Listen to Josh. He’s dropping valuable knowledge! Love it.
1521606038247591941 2022-05-03 21:42:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Maninoveralls Yeah, definitely want to get there. Just need to pause for a moment and get it all setup.
1521605873377947648 2022-05-03 21:41:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If anyone wants to save some time, head into my GDrive and make a copy of this Excel sheet.  Thanks!   https://t.co/B6GP4jKHl7

1521593517864280064 2022-05-03 20:52:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @juliemichellemo Not yet, but probably could be.
1521580174935998464 2022-05-03 19:59:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Top notch advice. I forget this sometimes. Great reminder.
1521574798031298561 2022-05-03 19:37:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kellylions @aibrahima With 315k social media followers, I get 50+ emails per day, so they are partially acting as gatekeepers.
1521574659564654595 2022-05-03 19:37:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aibrahima If your team is begging you then there's something there. Why not ask them why they're begging?
1521573422668685322 2022-05-03 19:32:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JonTuckerUSA Yep, Zirtual.
1521573361125576706 2022-05-03 19:32:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonFluharty Zirtual.
1521570300793659393 2022-05-03 19:20:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kuroschkhz I have zero team members. Just a VA! I do all of the writing, newsletters, courses, etc. myself.  I should though. It's literally my full-time job.
1521552999302242304 2022-05-03 18:11:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jordanenjoy_ 1. Admin tasks 2. Customer support tickets 3. Login/password issues  All of this stuff is so distracting during the day.
1521552788093915136 2022-05-03 18:10:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YvonneHappy Awesome!
1521552604681154560 2022-05-03 18:09:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jason_taban Zirtual is where I hired mine.
1521541729505140738 2022-05-03 17:26:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jstnalmzn Certainly, Justin.
1521541167552385024 2022-05-03 17:24:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ColoniaCamilo For sure. Working with a VA requires a very granular process.
1521540685782003714 2022-05-03 17:22:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreaplopezr Awesome!
1521540537337139205 2022-05-03 17:21:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luisantoniomata @soonyoungstokki Companies have insurance built in and you simply grant them access with limited admin privileges. You can take it away with the click of a button.
1521538416718008324 2022-05-03 17:13:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Howardmann Yep, Zirtual!
1521537732765523976 2022-05-03 17:10:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls Way more than I even assumed. She's been amazing.
1521537646530543617 2022-05-03 17:10:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IndyDevDan Crabs in a bucket.
1521536328659345408 2022-05-03 17:05:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcolemather Of course. Like the new name.
1521536285323804673 2022-05-03 17:04:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspujji @GrowthAssistant I'm not familiar. Checking it out now!   Thanks, Jesse.
1521536112816271361 2022-05-03 17:04:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mojosarmy @calalouf Absolutely!

1521534817397100545 2022-05-03 16:59:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luisantoniomata Zirtual has a plan for $750 a month.

1521534457043378176 2022-05-03 16:57:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamvikeshtiwari Of course!

1521533718170644480 2022-05-03 16:54:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Appreciate it. I’m sure there are much deeper, more complex ways to do it but this is 101 for me.
1521533591473299456 2022-05-03 16:54:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dikshayaar For sure!
1521533550788497408 2022-05-03 16:54:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv 100%. One of my best moves.

1521532229498855424 2022-05-03 16:48:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SyedHuq It's a huge time saver!
1521531917312700421 2022-05-03 16:47:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlKaufmanADI I found mine through Zirtual. She's amazing.
1521531873289248768 2022-05-03 16:47:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @willcoombe @RohunJauhar Awesome! Will check it out.
1521531262552489988 2022-05-03 16:44:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1521531260107214848 2022-05-03 16:44:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> // TL;DR  1. Audit your time 2. Record process videos 3. Store videos in Notion 4. Work together 1:1 for a month 5. Introduce workflow triggers 6. Review weekly
1521531253652140032 2022-05-03 16:44:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> //The Outcome  Rather than context switching &amp; losing time, I review our worksheet 1x in the AM and in the PM.  This has saved me ~2 hours per day.  That's 40 hours per month.  And with firms like Zirtual charging $750 per month for a VA, it's a great way to get your time back.
1521531148219953154 2022-05-03 16:44:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Move to a trigger-based system  Once we had worked together for a month, I introduced a trigger system.  1: Grant access to my email 2: She puts each email into a spreadsheet 3: I select the intended action from a drop-down 4: She sees the trigger and takes appropriate action  https://t.co/we6xWVR3Nq
1521531136178073601 2022-05-03 16:44:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Spend quality 1:1 time  Spend your first few weeks or a month, working together 1:1  Meet regularly, give direct feedback, and listen if they have suggestions.  Some VAs are so experienced that they make your processes 10x better.
1521531129081352192 2022-05-03 16:44:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Store the videos in Notion  Upload videos to a Notion page with additional instructions.  The most common instructions:  - Email templates to respond to prospects and customers - Username &amp; passwords for accounts they'll access - Links to other resources to support their work
1521531122521362432 2022-05-03 16:44:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Record Process videos  Your VA won't always have the background to understand what they’re solving &amp; why.  So, record a video where you walk through every single step.  Share these with a few people who have no context &amp; see if they can complete the tasks you teach on video.
1521531120055115778 2022-05-03 16:44:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Audit what distracts you the most  I pay close attention to my schedule to understand when I am most distracted, by what, and how often.  I keep a running tally each week to make sure I'm identifying any new distractions that have crept up.  Awareness is your first step.
1521531116565450752 2022-05-03 16:44:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Hiring a virtual assistant is life-changing.  My VA saves me ~40 hours of time per month.  Here's exactly how we work together in 6 simple steps.  🧵

1521527776783872001 2022-05-03 16:31:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamieBlackrose Both. Actively surrounded myself and studied like hell.
1521491410658205697 2022-05-03 14:06:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Damn. As a time management and systems nerd, I’m about to implement a bunch of this.
1521479250540470273 2022-05-03 13:18:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SGondalia @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 For sure people can! I just love giving them options. Thanks for the kind compliment as well, Samir.
1521477706063532032 2022-05-03 13:12:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MJmeetstheworld No, because I don't do much client work. I've productized mostly everything I know, and it sells 24/7.
1521476061938212866 2022-05-03 13:05:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SGondalia They are absolutely free to pursue that then.   I'm just sharing a different option, that's all.
1521475051161280512 2022-05-03 13:01:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @vinits00 @gregisenberg @dickiebush Thank you!
1521470821046407170 2022-05-03 12:44:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MJmeetstheworld I don't want a boss. I want the ability to turn off/on at any moment. I want to be able to travel whenever I want, and spend my time doing whatever I want.  None of that is possible with employment.
1521470500211466242 2022-05-03 12:43:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NisthaTripathi What a great group of folks to be mentioned with. Thanks so much, Nistha!
1521470279091994624 2022-05-03 12:42:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Ha. For sure. Build an ecosystem of supportive creators. It goes a very long way.
1521468878148317185 2022-05-03 12:37:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MJmeetstheworld The lifestyle I want to build has always been my why.
1521468367206588418 2022-05-03 12:35:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Nice thread here, Matt. It's cool to see the backstory behind the community. Keep going!
1521468084275625984 2022-05-03 12:33:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje You rock, my man. You've got such a great thing going with your visuals. Keep going!
1521468016646574085 2022-05-03 12:33:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi You'll thank yourself in 3-5 years.
1521467959201472512 2022-05-03 12:33:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eitan_levy101 Zero employees here.
1521467924262928387 2022-05-03 12:33:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoeHolka Can't wait to find out.
1521467896433680386 2022-05-03 12:33:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd Haha. That's how it works.
1521467862422102019 2022-05-03 12:33:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrivingCS Enjoying every moment of it.
1521467833795981312 2022-05-03 12:32:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen Let's partner.
1521467810416844800 2022-05-03 12:32:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevprakashSahoo Exactly.
1521467787226619904 2022-05-03 12:32:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KushShah9492 Thank you, my man!
1521465392958476289 2022-05-03 12:23:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heywarco Same here!
1521465337857941504 2022-05-03 12:22:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WillFlindall Thanks, Will.
1521465311094054912 2022-05-03 12:22:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tejas3732 Same.
1521465296170721282 2022-05-03 12:22:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @separmeen Thank you, Sep.
1521465268903493633 2022-05-03 12:22:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Go for it. Listen to people, but pocket away their comments and keep going.
1521465211810504705 2022-05-03 12:22:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ You too brother!
1521464360346042371 2022-05-03 12:19:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Reactions to my solopreneur journey:  - 2019: What are you doing? - 2020: How long can this last? - 2021: I've been following you for a bit. - 2022: Can I pick your brain for 30 minutes??  People project their own insecurities.  Ignore the doubt.
1521291222526087170 2022-05-03 00:51:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @briannekimmel 👋 Left my executive role as a CRO in 2019 and never looked back.
1521287237295427584 2022-05-03 00:35:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl @jessievbreugel @alicellemee @AlexLlullTW Thank you!
1521271334860468230 2022-05-02 23:32:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pedr0luna @LazerFocus_ I’ve heard really good things about the course @arvidkahl created about building an audience.
1521240495686627329 2022-05-02 21:29:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamVazquez Thank you, Adam!
1521223619225006081 2022-05-02 20:22:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NicolasHoferer @imjameskonn Build an audience.
1521183916765417473 2022-05-02 17:44:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Sometimes I literally cannot tell what people are selling.
1521181465182195713 2022-05-02 17:34:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @optimalcoco It certainly helps to have a skill that you can monetize, but I've seen people get awfully creative!
1521181371888287745 2022-05-02 17:34:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imjameskonn Best of luck!
1521177033212104704 2022-05-02 17:17:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KeanoCT By becoming well-known for doing a specific thing.
1521176672506200064 2022-05-02 17:15:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Certainly one I'm not going to miss.
1521175972128690184 2022-05-02 17:13:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @monaddevs I'm raking it in.
1521175941841629186 2022-05-02 17:13:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MeAtasu Every business is dependent on many things.
1521175810215919616 2022-05-02 17:12:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Appreciate you, man!
1521174608761733121 2022-05-02 17:07:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LazerFocus_ Become known for something. Talk about stuff you know and attract other people who are interested in learning more.
1521174440930852871 2022-05-02 17:07:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlKaufmanADI Become known for something by sharing your thoughts.
1521174358445731840 2022-05-02 17:06:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack Nice! We all start at $0.
1521174318918602753 2022-05-02 17:06:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_hancity By building an audience around a product or service that you can use to help people.
1521174248550805504 2022-05-02 17:06:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Pretty wild times.
1521173503495614464 2022-05-02 17:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Using Twitter, you can go from $0 online to $100k in one year.  - No career path - No daily meetings - No "can I have a raise?" - No performance reviews - No, "we don't have the budget"  Just heads down for 12 months.  A predictable system.   And uncapped earning potential.
1521168134056591360 2022-05-02 16:41:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii @abhishekshah173 Appreciate it!!
1521146007039492097 2022-05-02 15:14:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theranwy 100%.
1521145965201219585 2022-05-02 15:13:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Existential pain.
1521145932980572163 2022-05-02 15:13:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Same!
1521145913577771008 2022-05-02 15:13:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis These are awesome, Teddy.
1521145877825568771 2022-05-02 15:13:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Love that, Matt.
1521145654810226690 2022-05-02 15:12:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Point number one is so critical. Angry decisions are almost always wrong decisions.   Thanks for the mention here, Matt. Cheers.
1521118828788342785 2022-05-02 13:26:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heydarmen Well, then you're talking to the wrong person.   This advice is certainly much more helpful when you're speaking to the prospective buyer.
1521113325651771393 2022-05-02 13:04:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sankalpdomore @arvidkahl @MeetKevon I write and publish in Hypefury.
1521109491701399553 2022-05-02 12:48:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Yes. This!
1521109445375315968 2022-05-02 12:48:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gauravsingh961 Yep. If you have a problem, it's likely other people will as well.
1521109376412663808 2022-05-02 12:48:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Nailed it,  Sachin.

1521107185249538049 2022-05-02 12:39:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Way too hard.
1521106462986149889 2022-05-02 12:36:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MuhammadShan_ Welcome!
1521106446087340034 2022-05-02 12:36:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VinayKrKatiyar The world convinced people it's a must.
1521106387350269954 2022-05-02 12:36:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TothSebastien Yep.
1521106361848893442 2022-05-02 12:36:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heywarco Godin is a smart man.
1521106283721539586 2022-05-02 12:36:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imjameskonn I presell. If people buy, I build. If they don't, I don't.  Twitter and LinkedIn are great ways to figure out.
1521106179153354752 2022-05-02 12:35:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blairmacgregor Pain levels during discovery.  P1: Technical pain P2: Historical pain P3: Financial pain P4: Personal pain  The deeper you go, the better off you are.
1521105993836470272 2022-05-02 12:35:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 Presell to your existing audience. If nobody buys, don't build it.
1521105906657865731 2022-05-02 12:34:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's exactly right, Dhruv.
1521105853474123777 2022-05-02 12:34:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti 100%. You can't just assume people want what you have. Signals.
1521103738513117186 2022-05-02 12:26:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A mistake I see solopreneurs making:  Selling products for problems they haven't validated.  - No real problem - No real urgency - No real pain  Remember that pain is an indicator of purchase.  "Nice to have" doesn't sell much.
1520861202850717696 2022-05-01 20:22:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Smart shift...
1520791388048269312 2022-05-01 15:44:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ Yes. Having the right balance without being too hypercritical of oneself is definitely key. Good call out.
1520771911751454722 2022-05-01 14:27:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This is awesome.  And I'm definitely loving this format.   Note to self: Do this.
1520760567308472320 2022-05-01 13:42:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ken_carroll Yep. These people just tend to fade away after time, especially in a work environment.
1520758189561724930 2022-05-01 13:33:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kunal_KumarJ It makes fixing it much easier, Kunal.
1520758079817666562 2022-05-01 13:32:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iammosesaboh Always, Moses.
1520758056686075904 2022-05-01 13:32:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamvikeshtiwari Yep. If it's always on you, you get the power to fix it.
1520757978277810177 2022-05-01 13:32:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WritesToFreedom 100%, Armaan. Great point.
1520757943804862465 2022-05-01 13:32:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @swaycopy That's not weird at all. It's how you get better.
1520757099818635264 2022-05-01 13:28:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TothSebastien Of course. But if it's always someone else's fault...
1520756864572698625 2022-05-01 13:27:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv They'll definitely become clearer.
1520756455196008450 2022-05-01 13:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If it's always someone else's fault, it's probably your fault.
1520742144633356288 2022-05-01 12:29:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Appreciate it, Jessie!
1520585085208219648 2022-05-01 02:05:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thatYouTubGuy Thanks, Aniket!

1520491517684629507 2022-04-30 19:53:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianCarmody Thanks, my man!
1520445635094274049 2022-04-30 16:51:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vishakhak29 Thanks!
1520445576755691534 2022-04-30 16:50:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorVenkatesh I built it myself on Kajabi using a theme.
1520440730149343239 2022-04-30 16:31:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heykatgarcia Awesome! Congrats, Kat :)
1520440702005649408 2022-04-30 16:31:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoxDigitalcl Thank you so much!
1520440645336379393 2022-04-30 16:31:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DgtlMike To the newsletter? It takes about 45 minutes to write.  Another 15-30 minutes to edit.  And 20 minutes to get it all set up to send.
1520440493859082240 2022-04-30 16:30:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChristineCarril Thanks, Christine!
1520440437487644673 2022-04-30 16:30:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @greg_wair It's very freeing. Outside of a VA, I don't plan on expanding. Plus, I don't want to scale. I want to make the same and work less.
1520417777395421189 2022-04-30 15:00:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @landforce Yeah. I submitted a request for review 4 days ago and nothing yet. I think I can probably find a workaround, but glad to know it's still working for you. Appreciate you sharing.
1520415132467318786 2022-04-30 14:49:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattmylin Knowing that I have valuable information to share.
1520415074552270858 2022-04-30 14:49:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @landforce It says I need to fill out some survey to ask for permission. Maybe I'm just missing something?
1520408968224555008 2022-04-30 14:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @prestesonline Welcome! Thanks for reading.

1520407526969425920 2022-04-30 14:19:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dch625 Thank you, David!
1520405773695819777 2022-04-30 14:12:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HandsAreDiamond Yes, I prewrite each weekend.
1520405001453158400 2022-04-30 14:09:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theandreboso I'll be doing quite a bit of research, but I believe Kajabi has this built in.
1520404905214816257 2022-04-30 14:09:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamvikeshtiwari @theandreboso Perfect timing!
1520404574678528002 2022-04-30 14:07:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness Much appreciated, Bryant. Your weekend time is valuable, so thanks for giving me some of yours.
1520404498623176710 2022-04-30 14:07:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @josiahfitness I love hearing that, Josiah. Thank you!
1520403827178065920 2022-04-30 14:04:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theandreboso I'm gonna try it out...
1520403781913034752 2022-04-30 14:04:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TeshyT5 I'm not sure, but I'd expect it was a bit of both.
1520401915422691328 2022-04-30 13:57:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMeerShahid Thanks, Meer!
1520400492987305986 2022-04-30 13:51:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @karanontheline That's my thought process for sure, Karan.
1520399578150883328 2022-04-30 13:48:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulElijas Thanks so much for spending your valuable time reading it, Paul. I appreciate it.
1520399506243739648 2022-04-30 13:47:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Thanks so much for that, man. Means the world.
1520398425866612736 2022-04-30 13:43:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Get after it, Greg!
1520398367523803138 2022-04-30 13:43:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HandsAreDiamond Very well.
1520397951021068289 2022-04-30 13:41:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darrenchait @elonmusk I love keeping it simple.  No acronyms. No chance for things to get lost to confusion.  Explain things like you might to a child and communication suddenly gets more crisp.
1520397637232517120 2022-04-30 13:40:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HandsAreDiamond A broad range that eventually was whittled down over time.
1520397378452430849 2022-04-30 13:39:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets It sure is, man.
1520397317865709569 2022-04-30 13:39:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeYing77 Thanks, Mike!

1520396781741391875 2022-04-30 13:36:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoganBrownSWS Not sticking to my original promise of delivering, then ghosting, then shutting it down completely.
1520396428023156736 2022-04-30 13:35:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @getcabana Sweet. LMK what you think.
1520396401544507392 2022-04-30 13:35:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Phil_MWAi Heck yeah, Phil!
1520395858709295104 2022-04-30 13:33:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide I do repost, but I don't wait. I'm not trying to game the system. Just really trying to offer it up as people want to consume it.
1520394529467154432 2022-04-30 13:27:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Same, my man.

1520394416757878784 2022-04-30 13:27:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendancahill_ Haha.
1520394341444997121 2022-04-30 13:27:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv I sure hope so. Thanks for the kind words, Dhruv!

1520394155486294021 2022-04-30 13:26:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theinspiringco_ Ha. Thank you.
1520394039924822017 2022-04-30 13:26:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Ain't it though? So many people try, fail, quit.  Instead, try, fail, learn, pivot, try again.
1520393316772323328 2022-04-30 13:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1520393314691919878 2022-04-30 13:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> // Today's issue  Today, I broke down those 5 places in my newest issue.  Nothing complicated.  No "hacks".  Just simple places that I overlooked, and see many others missing.  If you have a newsletter (or want to start one), read today's issue:  https://t.co/JElqOQ5D08
1520393312796127233 2022-04-30 13:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Marketed more effectively  There are so many places to market a newsletter.  But in my first go-round, I missed some pretty obvious ones.  This time, I nailed 5 places my readers are already hanging out and consuming my content.  That helped subscriber growth fly.
1520393310896074754 2022-04-30 13:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Made it consumable  People are oversubscribed to newsletters.  So many newsletters are too long. Very few are too short.  Mine can always be read in less than 4 minutes and the lessons can be applied immediately.  That's my promise.
1520393308878561281 2022-04-30 13:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Clear outcome  Everywhere I market my newsletter, I'm clear about what readers will get.  One tip to grow your online audience and business each week.  No fluff. No nebulous, repurposed stuff.  Just tactical tips that have actually worked for the person writing it: me
1520393304801792000 2022-04-30 13:23:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Focused audience  I chose to focus on one specific avatar: solopreneurs  Generally, solopreneurs are growing their businesses online via content marketing and social media.  So, this makes it easy for me to deliver tactical lessons that I know will resonate.
1520393302075449344 2022-04-30 13:23:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 18 months ago, I started my first email newsletter.  I failed miserably and quit.  Then 90 days ago, I tried again and have grown it to 21,163 subscribers.  Here are 5 simple things I did differently:  🧵
1520389794223771649 2022-04-30 13:09:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I'm 100x more creative when I hit my morning walk with my wife.  We do 5-6 miles and the sheer number of ideas that come from that time is incredible.  When I miss, I struggle to create.
1520388832402808835 2022-04-30 13:05:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FullHarbor Thanks for sharing my thread, Austin. Much appreciated.

1520387092119003143 2022-04-30 12:58:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wordsbysusmita No secrets! Just simple things I missed the first time around.

1520019573529001985 2022-04-29 12:38:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Same here, Luke.
1520019554587586561 2022-04-29 12:37:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caitmackcs One of my favorite quotes
1520019459288743936 2022-04-29 12:37:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @navdeepsoni Definitely.
1520019426854248454 2022-04-29 12:37:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That’s it, my man.
1520019376967200769 2022-04-29 12:37:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Awesome, Hassan!
1520019334537654273 2022-04-29 12:37:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @7Printz Yep. It’s uphill work for awhile then downhill once systems are in place.
1520019224021848064 2022-04-29 12:36:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj That’s exactly it.
1520019175636414465 2022-04-29 12:36:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ always. These are the steps.
1520017866162163714 2022-04-29 12:31:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Great thread, Matt. Well written, and terrific takeaways. Cheers.
1520017628898770946 2022-04-29 12:30:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Great essay, Dickie. I'm pretty similar here. My first 3 hours are coffee and walking, followed by 2 hours of creating. 5 hours well planned.
1520016320753983490 2022-04-29 12:25:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurs can't rely on work ethic.  Instead:  - Eliminate what you can - Automate as much as possible - Build out systems for leftover work - Execute your systems every single day  Motivation eventually falters.  Systems rarely do.

1519660130564034560 2022-04-28 12:49:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @swaycopy I love that, Josh.
1519659357880864768 2022-04-28 12:46:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets Ha. Funny how that works.
1519659316034379777 2022-04-28 12:46:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ken_carroll There are definitely outstanding people, but most people are average action-takers.
1519659236766138369 2022-04-28 12:46:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PoonamSonawane_ It sure does.
1519659180893822977 2022-04-28 12:45:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IsaiahAscher I guess he said it better :)
1519655214235754496 2022-04-28 12:30:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis They certainly are, Teddy.
1519654439694573569 2022-04-28 12:27:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlizaKr Lol.
1519654392265248768 2022-04-28 12:26:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caitmackcs Exactly. Action and execution.
1519654357180071936 2022-04-28 12:26:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eitan_levy101 Absolutely. I've found this to be true as recently as yesterday.
1519653680324222976 2022-04-28 12:24:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TomLibelt Same.
1519653666659180545 2022-04-28 12:24:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NinaGreimel Take action and join them.
1519653615224430592 2022-04-28 12:23:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wenser2010 Yes. Everyone is the hero.
1519653586006913025 2022-04-28 12:23:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theo__jn That's a good mantra.
1519653475747086338 2022-04-28 12:23:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jayyanginspires This is exactly what I figured out.
1519653438707150848 2022-04-28 12:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @serenaded_ Very much so.
1519653418444468224 2022-04-28 12:23:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's it, Dhruv.
1519652723045588992 2022-04-28 12:20:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The most mind-bending, freedom-inducing realization I've ever had is that my heroes are average people.

1519300486683406341 2022-04-27 13:00:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets I'm not actually sure, to be honest. I want to build my business around myself, so that's why I choose to be non-anonymous.

1519291992177577984 2022-04-27 12:26:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco Be present and in front daily.
1519291044315213829 2022-04-27 12:23:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurs don't need viral content.  Marketing is about getting on base every day.  - Familiar face - Familiar name - Familiar content - Familiar opinions  It's cliché as hell but play Moneyball.

1519005541393125379 2022-04-26 17:28:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj @dickiebush Exactly.
1519005508396531712 2022-04-26 17:28:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MJmeetstheworld @dickiebush It's certainly more helpful to believe you can than to believe you can't.  Doesn't mean you have to try. But the belief, IMO, is necessary.
1519005323155156993 2022-04-26 17:27:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Hell yeah it is.

1518998817936486400 2022-04-26 17:01:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's exactly it, my man.
1518998541133393922 2022-04-26 17:00:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Thanks, my man!
1518997771621224450 2022-04-26 16:57:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Well, that's a wrap!  I hope you got some value out of this thread and can apply some of these learnings immediately.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1518997769020653570 2022-04-26 16:57:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Ask people a question  You'd be surprised by how excited people are to share their opinion.  Whenever I ask a simple question, I get an incredible amount of engagement.  Here's a question I asked that shocked me with the number of responses.   https://t.co/TBOgeGVUbR
1518997766910980096 2022-04-26 16:57:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Answer people's questions  One of the easiest ways to get new followers is by making yourself available.  Whenever I'm on a train or plane, I like to take some time and run an AMA.  Here's a recent one about Twitter growth that resonated:   https://t.co/XzV35WYm6f
1518997764889358338 2022-04-26 16:57:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Motivate people  Many folks are on Twitter because they want to improve their lives.  So motivation works to get people to lean in and read your content.  I like to combine motivation with education to pump people up and then show them how it's done.   https://t.co/3zVqEe0ggx
1518997762926329857 2022-04-26 16:57:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Aggregate for people  One trend is collecting helpful information for people in one place.  For example, I use no-code tools to build my one-person businesses.  And I had a hypothesis that people would be interested in my favorite tools.  I was right.   https://t.co/hfEVo5oV6V
1518997753560502276 2022-04-26 16:57:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Support other people  Supporting other people is a cheat code on Twitter.  I generally do this through commenting.  It helps me foster strong relationships with interesting people across the world.  If you want to grow, start doing this.  https://t.co/1iEPZoJ9Mp
1518997746274996231 2022-04-26 16:57:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Make people think  I like to use copywriting &amp; wordplay to make people think.  And with limited attention spans, doing that in the shortest amount of characters can be powerful.  Here's an example of a "wordplay" Tweet that made people think.   https://t.co/5pSdSVYpDE
1518997744077189121 2022-04-26 16:57:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Entertain  If you educate 100% of the time, you run the risk of boring the reader.  Once you bore your audience, you get tuned out.   This is where entertainment comes in.  For example, this tweet helped me add nearly 500 followers.   https://t.co/FP6sw2PUhM
1518997735512412162 2022-04-26 16:57:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Teach or educate  You can start by sharing your expertise in a tactical way.  For example, I shared my 4-step writing process in this thread.  It's tactical and teaches people something they can use right away.   https://t.co/NxMdQiFKch
1518997696090103814 2022-04-26 16:57:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A Twitter audience is a massive asset.   I've added 52,437 Twitter followers in 90 days.  Here are 8 types of content that made the biggest impact:  [Thread 🧵]
1518997030206685187 2022-04-26 16:54:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmCoachClint Great stuff here, man!  Thanks for including me, Coach.
1518996759531474945 2022-04-26 16:53:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me @blackmagic_so Glad it helped bring awareness to an awesome tool!
1518996687368462336 2022-04-26 16:53:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_DanMottram @ship30for30 Great stuff, man!
1518996346103083008 2022-04-26 16:52:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann @craigburgess I misread the original post, sorry.  I do recaps and lessons from things I've actually done.  Most people are like "I looked at 7,496 websites in the last 30 days and here are my takeaways."   I just don't do that stuff. That's what I was getting at.
1518995888756170758 2022-04-26 16:50:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_IlirAliu @JakubPiskor @euboid Thanks, man!
1518950831214714880 2022-04-26 13:51:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Mindset is a wild thing. Part of my success is just believing I can do anything. Literally anything I want. Run for mayor? Yep. Make $5M? Yep. Run a a marathon? Yep.   Maybe I’ll do none of them but I feel like I can.
1518943811849887746 2022-04-26 13:23:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @polak_jasper I'm glad it resonated!@
1518940348827025409 2022-04-26 13:09:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Killer thread, man. For those folks who want to land big opps, this one is a must.

1518938040395350017 2022-04-26 13:00:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ Thank you, Matt!
1518936300061184002 2022-04-26 12:53:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PhilJ0606 Time to think about it :)
1518935838343712770 2022-04-26 12:51:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Yes. It's "passive" but still requires content creation, so it's the outcome of work (that makes it less so).
1518933154123374597 2022-04-26 12:40:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Oh for sure!
1518933126134837251 2022-04-26 12:40:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BigBadKale Thank you, sir.

1518931418080022530 2022-04-26 12:34:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RazaCute I was previously an executive at a tech company. Now I make a living as a creator.
1518930311798796290 2022-04-26 12:29:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @creation247 Damn. That's where it's at, man. Nice work. Love your account, FYI. Cheers.

1518625337009127426 2022-04-25 16:17:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @esanteralli @swaycopy @amandanat I don't think so, no.   It's because the platform is starving for good creators. So many consumers, so few creators with high-quality content.   That's just my take. I could be very wrong.
1518622052491706368 2022-04-25 16:04:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanPHogue Definitely. That's why I create for one and distribute to all others. But I've been doing this for 3 years.
1518621772576403457 2022-04-25 16:03:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fred_klaviyopro @writingtoriches @gumroad That's so awesome to hear. Thanks, man!
1518621679181836290 2022-04-25 16:03:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @swaycopy @amandanat It's easier to stand out with less followers on LinkedIn.   The more followers you accrue on the Twitter, the much faster you can grow (significantly faster than LI).
1518587851788673025 2022-04-25 13:48:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Congrats, Anthony! Glad I could be helpful in some small way 🙌🏻
1518587568257998848 2022-04-25 13:47:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I love reading @sivers    I think my favorite part of How to Live is he intentionally flip flops on nearly every topic, presenting a good argument for multiple takes on one thought.
1518574538719649793 2022-04-25 12:55:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti @BrandonFluharty Much appreciated, man!
1518573771547938819 2022-04-25 12:52:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eikom  https://t.co/4DE2jPNXme
1518573314129682436 2022-04-25 12:51:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThusSpokeRahul Nope. Just ran out of characters.
1518571913152544770 2022-04-25 12:45:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @moimaere I know @sparktoro is a great tool for finding where your audience hangs.
1518570688960937984 2022-04-25 12:40:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bresslertweets I'm not sure. I still think LinkedIn is the most underused, content-starved channel there is. I'd probably do the same.
1518570516956778501 2022-04-25 12:39:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @SahilBloom @gregisenberg @ShaanVP @JamesClear Thank you, Matt! Massive appreciation.
1518568298639761408 2022-04-25 12:31:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichelleCaira Definitely.
1518568247972536320 2022-04-25 12:30:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Max_Stevens6 @desoprotocol Ahh. Gotcha. I'm not smart enough to know what that is 😂
1518568187046113282 2022-04-25 12:30:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichelleCaira They may not be. If they aren't, don't bother. For many people though, they are.
1518567891532189698 2022-04-25 12:29:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JasonRBradwell 100%, Jason.
1518567852915240960 2022-04-25 12:29:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imjameskonn Definitely. But not for social posting.
1518567589508788227 2022-04-25 12:28:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Max_Stevens6 @desoprotocol Interesting. I'll have to learn more.
1518567530616565765 2022-04-25 12:28:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That's right, Dhruv.
1518567019993567234 2022-04-25 12:26:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneur distribution:  - TikTok - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - YouTube - HackerNews - Indie Hackers - Facebook Groups - Private Slack/Discord  If you create once, might as well scale distribution.  Different customers hang in different channels.
1518558188295098368 2022-04-25 11:51:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jafrog Now THAT is funny.

1518303283537924096 2022-04-24 18:58:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MayankJ IMO, yes.
1518303214097113088 2022-04-24 18:57:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorVenkatesh 1. IMO people care about information quality vs. production quality  2. I use simple landing pages because it doesn't complicate the buyer.

1518254283875098625 2022-04-24 15:43:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheAmineAouragh Exactly, Amine.

1518223202656395269 2022-04-24 13:39:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen Momentum ftw.
1518223172650344450 2022-04-24 13:39:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj I believe this as well, Omara. Great point.
1518223068925202432 2022-04-24 13:39:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realjondavids Haha. It can certainly be more complicated, but this is the easiest way to start.
1518222113861259265 2022-04-24 13:35:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Nailed it. Get the momentum going with crisp simplicity.

1518220618164064260 2022-04-24 13:29:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mzaragozas Yep. Most good things are tough to do well.

1518219859653505025 2022-04-24 13:26:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamsimm0 @SahilBloom Great minds 🧠
1518219739218198529 2022-04-24 13:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What you need to start earning money online:  - Attention - A landing page - A good product/service - A way to accept payment  That’s about it.  Resist the urge to overcomplicate.
1518219464986267648 2022-04-24 13:25:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EliasArriazola Awesome!

1517908222400679938 2022-04-23 16:48:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @esmiffz Repurpose your Twitter stuff to LinkedIn. It will work extremely well.
1517896914225840128 2022-04-23 16:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is about managing emotions.  - Don't get amped by $15k days. - Don't get depressed by $0 days.  Slow and steady, 1% better each day.

1517868529411936261 2022-04-23 14:10:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge @SahilBloom Damn, man. I thought I was good at Excel! These are awesome. Can't wait to use some of them...
1517868309454241794 2022-04-23 14:09:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamSinger Yeah, plus Reddit is so nasty. LinkedIn is quite friendly.
1517868162355802112 2022-04-23 14:09:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @helenleemoon @coachgmuncy Nice work, Helen 💪
1517867924471566338 2022-04-23 14:08:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamSinger Gotcha!  -# of new connections: 7,174  -Revenue: Nearly impossible to attribute given I make sales all day long, but did about $18,750 within 72 hours of the post.  -Inbound opportunities: I don't do anything that would constitute "inbound leads" really.
1517866654998437890 2022-04-23 14:03:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamSinger When you say outcomes, what do you mean exactly? I want to make sure I understand the question.   Do you mean revenue?
1517865763968851968 2022-04-23 13:59:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Thanks, man!
1517865713423290368 2022-04-23 13:59:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mycarlwright I'm not sure. I haven't really tried. Anything is possible with good content. Experiment!
1517860328805212161 2022-04-23 13:37:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @noah_ifergan All my posts are basically experiments on what resonates with people.

1517856592217186305 2022-04-23 13:23:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I wrote a LinkedIn post with the intention of going viral.  Virality is almost never my goal, but I decided to try.  Here are the Results:  - 4.766M+ impressions - 50,583 engagements - 1,444 comments - 1,589 shares  Here's how I wrote it:  https://t.co/I0QSlr9xrN
1517855559847923712 2022-04-23 13:19:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Number 2 is so important. So much "connect and ask" in the world.

1517551212836622336 2022-04-22 17:09:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tweetsbyejordan @thealexbanks Agree 100%. The problem is that Twitter has labeled LinkedIn as "uncool" so people let their ego get in the way rather than just going over and opening up a new 6-figure channel.  My secret sauce is that I don't care what people think.
1517550302496444418 2022-04-22 17:06:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tweetsbyejordan Can't wait to share it.

1517547636542345216 2022-04-22 16:55:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen That's one way to do it!
1517547598722310146 2022-04-22 16:55:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Agreed. Each has their pros/cons.

1517546847660916738 2022-04-22 16:52:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter hates LinkedIn.  But some of the biggest Twitter names are publishing there daily.  Because engagement is off the charts.  Tomorrow, I'm going to break down the anatomy of my highest performing LinkedIn post.  Join 19,227 subscribers here:  https://t.co/vCOnWlle21
1517490061272436736 2022-04-22 13:06:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco Nailed it.
1517487662852198402 2022-04-22 12:57:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabbart_ You can do lots of things in a few hours. But the success is miles away.
1517486341776367618 2022-04-22 12:51:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco Remain*
1517486301653647361 2022-04-22 12:51:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco Yup. Note it. Take it down. But, ultimately remind focused on your mission if you feel you have the right data to move.
1517485685678223361 2022-04-22 12:49:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets It's great you recognized and pivoted though! Most people can't say the same.
1517485371944226816 2022-04-22 12:48:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @extoldirector Love this, Michael.
1517485315757424642 2022-04-22 12:47:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @johnherrington Yep! Build for the long term and win.
1517485238754197505 2022-04-22 12:47:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Dude. You're killing it. Keep going, brother!
1517485184916066306 2022-04-22 12:47:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Brett_Trainor Never does.
1517485166180151296 2022-04-22 12:47:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @voidabhi True story.
1517485138782957570 2022-04-22 12:47:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoganBrownSWS Yep. But everyone is picking up every rock trying to find some hidden key.

1517482741549391873 2022-04-22 12:37:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Same :)
1517482697337319424 2022-04-22 12:37:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Brett_Trainor But everyone tries.
1517482670829326336 2022-04-22 12:37:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Like you. Look at your growth, my man...32k? WOW. Loving watching you fly here.
1517480539262967808 2022-04-22 12:28:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeYing77 Play it and win.
1517480518908096512 2022-04-22 12:28:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BigBadKale Always.
1517480501539487745 2022-04-22 12:28:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP I just want to be standing when most aren't.
1517479604092612609 2022-04-22 12:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone is looking for a shortcut, so the short game is fierce.  Playing the long game is significantly less crowded.

1517250186220822529 2022-04-21 21:13:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Love that. Also, realize that most people you admire are impostors in some way, shape, or form. Every great person I talk to feels it.
1517249410157191168 2022-04-21 21:10:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi @ship30for30 Definitely they will.
1517249357912887297 2022-04-21 21:10:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sterespect Maybe. Maybe not.

1517249151641206784 2022-04-21 21:09:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CCollinsDC It's a winging it world.
1517248525763059712 2022-04-21 21:06:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshFromCMG I don't know what this means, but I like it.
1517248390073098240 2022-04-21 21:06:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jryankennedy I think so too.
1517248369353183232 2022-04-21 21:06:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @polak_jasper Everyone is just playing the game.
1517248339217162240 2022-04-21 21:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Always.
1517247881954144256 2022-04-21 21:04:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The best way to deal with impostor syndrome is to realize everyone is an impostor.
1517188799410982912 2022-04-21 17:09:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hastakshar Too kind. When I come to Mumbai, I will DM you.
1517186537695424519 2022-04-21 17:00:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hastakshar Sunbasket :)
1517176149826314242 2022-04-21 16:19:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pradologue Definitely.
1517176007995891717 2022-04-21 16:18:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WealthProfits Always.
1517175939255484418 2022-04-21 16:18:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisfreder I don't think this is true at all.
1517175827682705409 2022-04-21 16:17:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @Natalie_Furn Yes, definitely. I like to assume that the folks I write for know that automating crappy things just brings you more crap at scale.
1517175365130727425 2022-04-21 16:16:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @e_stradella Yep.
1517175342024245250 2022-04-21 16:16:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @salesystemsB2B Nailed it.
1517175314748743681 2022-04-21 16:15:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro If you spend 2 hours and the task takes 2 minutes, at 60 tasks, you're in the green.
1517175220964147206 2022-04-21 16:15:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkPraschan I like that. As much as I love productivity, I wasn't aware of this one.
1517171873943113737 2022-04-21 16:02:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you've done it twice, automate it.
1517147223288475653 2022-04-21 14:24:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dikshayaar @amanpreet_27 @SahilBloom @warikoo @NiharikaSodhi Thank you!
1517147085723734017 2022-04-21 14:23:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikefutia Depends. If you want a publishing tool, go Hypefury. If you want to understand your analytics deeply, go BlackMagic.
1517147019730595845 2022-04-21 14:23:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NinaGreimel The bigger the pain, the better.
1517146940433084417 2022-04-21 14:23:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @forwardincption 100% it is.
1517119364721483776 2022-04-21 12:33:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Thank you, my man :)
1517119309717422080 2022-04-21 12:33:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theavoboy @jjxe_ I love that.
1517119281368117250 2022-04-21 12:33:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sladeerickson Exactly. We focus on one post instead of the aggregate.
1517119175419965442 2022-04-21 12:32:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Pirzada23 Journaling, observations, systems, daily life, etc.
1517119082285477888 2022-04-21 12:32:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hermanvaswrites Agreed, Herman.
1517119047116247040 2022-04-21 12:32:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshcervone Yep. Discipline makes winners.

1517118972872859648 2022-04-21 12:32:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoeHolka Always have the longest view.
1517118909270446081 2022-04-21 12:31:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisisming Smart comment, Christopher.
1517118833236058117 2022-04-21 12:31:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Right? Even if I got very little in terms of "engagement" the clarity it provides my mind is priceless.
1517116985896747008 2022-04-21 12:24:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Wow. That's an awesome story, Kieran. Love it, man!
1517116904565059591 2022-04-21 12:23:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChinwokeNnamani Always. Long game over everything.
1517116782221398016 2022-04-21 12:23:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Rarelyonmakeup So much better daily.
1517116751472996352 2022-04-21 12:23:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Agreed 100%, Greg.
1517116009211211776 2022-04-21 12:20:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've written every day for 3+ years now.  - Sometimes people love it. - Sometimes people hate it. - Sometimes people ignore it.  You know what?  Doesn't matter.  Publishing my thoughts leads to internal growth.

1516863076259311620 2022-04-20 19:35:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship isn't about a great idea.  It's about attracting people and delivering value.  average idea + great marketing + quality delivery = a viable business
1516809455299702793 2022-04-20 16:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's amazing how many average people make incredible money simply because they believe in themselves.
1516797112708743176 2022-04-20 15:13:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches Feel the same. Big goal energy.

1516755770473394180 2022-04-20 12:28:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steve_P_Brady Love it dude.
1516754378954264581 2022-04-20 12:23:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is simple.  Things you don’t need:  - Tons of money - 100k+ followers - A college degree - A blue checkmark - The perfect tech stack - 10+ years of experience  Things you do need:  - Engaged audience around one topic - A problem worth solving - A solution
1516694429121355777 2022-04-20 08:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Complaining about everyone else instead of curating a better feed.

1516688557909417985 2022-04-20 08:01:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Great thread, man. Obviously, you know I love templatizing everything. I have some cool stuff on deck based on reading this. Thanks!

1516470707315744774 2022-04-19 17:36:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kjellvdv Probably about $250/month all in. But these run nearly my entire business. Not a bad ROI.

1516462784900476932 2022-04-19 17:04:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni It's so great. I don't like the complexity of GA, so Fathom is right up my allet.

In Notion I:  - Host my roadmap - Manage my to-do list - Write all of my content - Store my process docs - And much more...  And I'm still learning how to use it most effectively.
1516457785659121674 2022-04-19 16:44:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @carrd @gumroad @canva @outseta @airtable @Calendly @usefathom @loom @Yannick_Veys 11/ Typeshare  I write a weekly newsletter called, The Saturday Solopreneur.  As much short-form content as I write, I struggled with long-form.  Until I purchased @typeshare_co   Now, I open it up, pick a template, and write my newsletter in less than 30 minutes.   Gamechanger.
1516457782899359760 2022-04-19 16:44:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @carrd @gumroad @canva @outseta @airtable @Calendly @usefathom @loom 10/ HypeFury  @Yannick_Veys added new features that have recently turned it from good to "I can't live without this".

1516457765413212174 2022-04-19 16:44:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @carrd @gumroad @canva @outseta @airtable @Calendly 7/ Fathom Analytics  Looking at Google Analytics can be confusing for some folks.  @usefathom is simple, privacy-first, cookie-free, and GDPR compliant.  Plus, with just a glance, I know exactly what is impacting my website traffic.   Great service.

1516166492303278090 2022-04-18 21:27:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Compound interest, baby.
1516166224484438021 2022-04-18 21:26:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti It's so frequently the opposite of what we expect.
1516166113259888643 2022-04-18 21:25:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DavidWeckworth Keep hitting singles.   One day you'll swing for one and accidentally hit a home run.
1516165984339517449 2022-04-18 21:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianCarmody I'll walk a marathon 😉
1516165910809264134 2022-04-18 21:24:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Definitely. Just by publishing daily, I've exposed myself to so many opportunities.

1516138307343761412 2022-04-18 19:35:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most solopreneurs misunderstand content.  It's not about daily virality attempts.  It's about having thousands of your thoughts in the ecosystem at any moment in time.  1000+ pieces working hard on your behalf.  So, publish frequently.   Because you never know what resonates.
1516122480175464453 2022-04-18 18:32:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevprakashSahoo It sure does, Dev.

1516121934173458440 2022-04-18 18:30:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Nailed it, Max.
1516100019706867714 2022-04-18 17:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you can influence people online, you have a head start on entrepreneurship.

1516031579075788800 2022-04-18 12:31:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi I presell. Doesn’t mean you have to, but I think it’s worth it.
1516030353764454406 2022-04-18 12:26:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Simple solopreneurs win.  1% go from idea to MVP in a day.  99% get stuck:  - Trying to find the coolest domain name - Crowdsourcing opinions from strangers - Running polls to pick the "right" software - Designing a logo before they have anything to sell  Ship. Then complicate.
1515989255704698884 2022-04-18 09:42:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me 👋
1515988995758510081 2022-04-18 09:41:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotechAna I generally ignore, “aggressive knowledge” where people are overly confident in delivering knowledge that is extremely contextual.
1515940927633862656 2022-04-18 06:30:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti We all know more about something than someone else though!

1515689325735956486 2022-04-17 13:51:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Reminder to all solopreneurs:  Something very obvious to you is worth a lot of money to someone else.  Have a great Sunday.
1515664431417495554 2022-04-17 12:12:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NonCitizenFive I don’t know what this means.

1515604043871182853 2022-04-17 08:12:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @acagamic I don't, but that's a good idea.

1515603932650868738 2022-04-17 08:11:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulElijas I think it can be, yes.  That's because Twitter can be such a different platform based on what you want to accomplish.  It's curated pretty darn well.
1515603748919386115 2022-04-17 08:11:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MeetKevon Thanks so much, Kevin!
1515603713490051073 2022-04-17 08:10:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_Ebner If you focus more on your core area, you'll grow faster.

1515603552219107331 2022-04-17 08:10:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SalesWiseFran Engage in conversations with high-quality accounts.
1515603495436619780 2022-04-17 08:10:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MgnoliaTitanium You can use. SparkToro or Followerwonk, but it's mostly just involving yourself in the conversation and getting to know people who matter.
1515603333469413376 2022-04-17 08:09:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Simona_road Nah. Mine was dormant for 10 years.
1515603219778609152 2022-04-17 08:09:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Thank you, my man. Right back at you. You've been growing like crazy.
1515602156308553728 2022-04-17 08:04:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ @briansowards I realized I missed one of your Q’s. I produced threads each Tuesday when I started but have fallen off lately because of travel. Plan on getting back to it soon.
1515415689624002560 2022-04-16 19:43:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Everyone has multiple interests. When we're starting out, it's good to be known as someone who delivers a specific message time in and time out. Nice work, Mike!
1515415337914839056 2022-04-16 19:42:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @briansowards @thisiskp_ Great questions (and thanks for following, KP).  I usually take two sittings to produce a thread. One to write it, one to edit it.  I schedule nearly everything. It's my full-time job so I have the privilege of being able to spend each day executing &amp; evaluating my strategy.
1515414855070765060 2022-04-16 19:40:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MaxBramwell I do, but usually as an LP only. I've made a few angel investments on my own, but mostly into companies run by people I know well.
1515414761508384774 2022-04-16 19:40:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @7Printz Thanks, Kevin!
1515414714997788681 2022-04-16 19:39:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen If you enjoy it, go for it. I can't crank that many threads out. But I suspect it will help growth.
1515351852883353612 2022-04-16 15:30:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @castle_bridges Thanks! Just bored on the train :)
1515332762714185737 2022-04-16 14:14:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChaseArbeiter Thank you so much, Chase! I appreciate Tweets like this that let me know my newsletter is resonating. Cheers, bud.
1515331068504809476 2022-04-16 14:07:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @warrenthehuman I use my calendar to schedule out all important tasks for my business, of which content is one of them.
1515330723661725699 2022-04-16 14:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timothyjacque 1. Design a profile worth following  2. Share a very useful tip each day  3. Engage with 3-5 high-value accounts with incredibly helpful comments  4. Write one Tweet thread per week showing how you think at a very deep level.
1515330401929211916 2022-04-16 14:04:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @braden_mosley On LinkedIn? Because they punish links.
1515328978416017412 2022-04-16 13:59:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HustleJoy Daily life, journaling, questions from my audience, looking back at old content, courses, blogs I read, etc.
1515328761650204680 2022-04-16 13:58:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SchusterDev Brevity. Everything has to be shorter and punchier.
1515328568443777025 2022-04-16 13:57:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro I'd figure out one first, and then hit the 2nd.
1515326474521391104 2022-04-16 13:49:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coreymlevine How does everything I create work together in harmony to help my business grow faster?
1515326402748420099 2022-04-16 13:49:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Interestingly enough, there is very little difference.   Twitter requires better writing because of character limitations.
1515326271449927684 2022-04-16 13:48:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coreymlevine Talk about things you've figured out if your life that other people desperately want to figure out. The rest happens naturally.
1515323224816594946 2022-04-16 13:36:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @noah_ifergan Definitely have a system.  You should spend some time on my website. Tons of free information around systems:  https://t.co/64c9clqIuz
1515322867675807747 2022-04-16 13:34:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @braden_mosley 1. Be clear aka profile optimization  2. Give people a specific reason - like very specific.  3. Help other people to grow and you'll help yourself.
1515322444415967235 2022-04-16 13:33:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @feelthebyrn1 @blackmagic_so Thanks, man. Sometimes I feel very unproductive, so just know that :)
1515322060649775104 2022-04-16 13:31:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coreymlevine How to tie all of the different platforms together in a cohesive way.
1515321946086457351 2022-04-16 13:31:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coreymlevine I'm not sure. I do all of my own digital marketing.
1515321874980474887 2022-04-16 13:31:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabbart_ A simple one: carve out time and respond to things I'm generally interested in.
1515321770668134404 2022-04-16 13:30:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @undervalu That people are nasty.
1515321720911114249 2022-04-16 13:30:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @feelthebyrn1 @blackmagic_so I haven't. I could though.
1515321678263459842 2022-04-16 13:30:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonArvay It amlost always starts with value. It snowballs with hype. Aka: the rich get richer.
1515320204934406151 2022-04-16 13:24:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gus_tiffer Definitely not. I just started about 5 months ago.
1515319083708862479 2022-04-16 13:19:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets By talking about specific things and helping them find me.
1515319038141992962 2022-04-16 13:19:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HustleJoy Wine.
1515318468211576838 2022-04-16 13:17:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonArvay It's definitely everywhere. Online is a lot like offline. Offline, the same things happen at work.
1515318251324153858 2022-04-16 13:16:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Hunckler I DM almost zero. I hate anything other than email :)
1515318173658189826 2022-04-16 13:16:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @undervalu Hip hop.
1515317036724936704 2022-04-16 13:11:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RobbiRavi Thanks, Ravi!
1515316990667284486 2022-04-16 13:11:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabbart_ In the beginning, conversations helped me grow more.  Now, my own Tweets do.  I carve out time on my calendar to do both.
1515316849889718272 2022-04-16 13:11:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @undervalu Replies.
1515316177228410882 2022-04-16 13:08:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HustleJoy I just like sharing things that I think of, but we're all influenced by what we read.
1515316019388207112 2022-04-16 13:07:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yytambaya_ Easy to prove you wrong.  Lots of people consistently Tweet, have patience, and never grow a following. There ya go,.
1515315828715106307 2022-04-16 13:07:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adewole_gs @HustleJoy There's no hack.  They just learn how to write and share information that other people desperately want to know.  It's information they understand that other people don't.
1515315478763294721 2022-04-16 13:05:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @undervalu I don't write that many to begin with, but maybe.
1515315162466729987 2022-04-16 13:04:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mvarghese5 Thank you, man!
1515315088521150467 2022-04-16 13:04:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArpitMutha7 I don't actually remember. It was probably back in 2014.
1515314997810929675 2022-04-16 13:03:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_VersatyleStyle They are one in the same.
1515314901639700486 2022-04-16 13:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HustleJoy I don't agree with it 100%, no. I think it's helpful to be deeper in your career, but we all have knowledge that helps other people.  There are a lot of young kids (14-17) that have huge followings on here.
1515314612358590478 2022-04-16 13:02:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachShaneA I'm going from Edinburgh, Scotland to London
1515314104788992013 2022-04-16 13:00:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonArvay I think it's taking complex principles and making them much more simple. At least, that's the feedback I get from my audience.
1515313739007991814 2022-04-16 12:58:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mhpeltekian I recommend picking up just one book, any book that has good reviews and reading it. Then start writing.   The biggest problem is people keep reading and reading and reading and thinking that will help.  Read, then write! (try Cashvertising as a book(
1515313735010762752 2022-04-16 12:58:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MusaMussaddiq Sure thing
1515313060273131523 2022-04-16 12:56:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @takaokubo @maxwellcdavis Roughly, yes.
1515312919877148672 2022-04-16 12:55:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EcomSimo I have a lot of questions to answer, so won't choose 10, but here are some that come to mind:  @dvassallo  @jackbutcher  @dickiebush  @Nicolascole77
1515312631904620544 2022-04-16 12:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ethan_Mick Either can work. Test them out and see what resonates. Double down on whichever does.
1515312528733130759 2022-04-16 12:53:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @web3paloma Probably one of these two.  1.  https://t.co/6ut5J0KHLg  2.  https://t.co/D3kOWfHoW6
1515312290542895110 2022-04-16 12:52:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EcomSimo Around 20k I started growing much, much faster.
1515312229037576193 2022-04-16 12:52:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachtalkswealth Once I made about $10k, I opened an LLC. Doesn't mean it's the right answer, but it's what I did.
1515312130194563076 2022-04-16 12:52:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack Right now, I'm learning about using a VA really effectively. We all learn stuff every single day.
1515312050574135299 2022-04-16 12:52:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ModestMitkus Thanks so much, man!
1515311664891146247 2022-04-16 12:50:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RajKishorShaw17 Make sure your profile tells people exactly who you are, and why they should follow you.  Share a tip each day, and engage with 3-5 important accounts in your industry each day as well.

1515309378005762048 2022-04-16 12:41:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mrbooktook1 By understanding that everything worth doing is a long-game play.
1515309288750788615 2022-04-16 12:41:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BecomingaThera I'm not sure, but I don't think of myself (or others) as "experts" per se.  I think of myself (and them) as having knowledge that other people want who are behind me in their journey.   Just "being you" may never really attract a following.
1515309086354681862 2022-04-16 12:40:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandymedia Try niching down in the beginning and getting gradually wider over time.
1515308954892570625 2022-04-16 12:39:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach Try a tool like SparkToro or Followerwonk

1515308319766122499 2022-04-16 12:37:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ironicalwords I actually don't know, to be honest. I've never reviewed the ratio nor have I ever run a Twitter spaces :) Sorry.
1515308190602338307 2022-04-16 12:36:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh Thanks, Harsh!
1515307995583979520 2022-04-16 12:35:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JonahPerlin I welcome disagreement. There's a lot of advice that is contextual and doesn't have a right/wrong answer.  I block trolls and nitpickers.
1515307850913959943 2022-04-16 12:35:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonArvay I had a big following on LinkedIn. I think that helped, but I was stuck at 8k followers forever on Twitter even with that big following.  When I started creating constantly, I got noticed by bigger Twitter creators and that certainly helped.
1515307659364384775 2022-04-16 12:34:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyteo_ 1) LinkedIn has been good to me. I enjoy Twitter more.  2) Text only  3) No hacks. Just good writing and consistency.
1515307347765338116 2022-04-16 12:33:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joe_goodman_ I wait until a particular business is stable (i.e. can be run on automation or with a VA) then I move to something else.

1515306432991797253 2022-04-16 12:29:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vendettasdf I write every day. I review my writing every day. I read great content from great writers every day. I constantly read about copywriting best practices.
1515306067953168384 2022-04-16 12:28:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti 100%. It's probably easier.

1515305937908682755 2022-04-16 12:27:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @m_ashcroft I carve time out each day to review my mentions and which replies drive more growth using tools like @blackmagic_so   Then, I participate for 30-45.
1515305745868337155 2022-04-16 12:26:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ADHDJobs Love me some Dan Levy.
1515305573704683529 2022-04-16 12:26:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MandaGummer It's a rather nebulous question, so probably not best for a Tweet. Try this:  https://t.co/05aHy1LUJL
1515305334943924234 2022-04-16 12:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuuabe I'm not sure, to be honest.  In the beginning, it was more about the quality of replies.  More recently, it's been about the quality of my actual Tweets.  I block time on my calendar to balance for sure.
1515305130358419460 2022-04-16 12:24:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Appreciate that, man.
1515305066785390594 2022-04-16 12:24:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maxwellcdavis Maybe 45 minutes to an hour?
1515304980810551303 2022-04-16 12:23:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellocaffrey My own content. It used to be the opposite at the beginning.
1515304854897541127 2022-04-16 12:23:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @commswell_com Extremely important.  Everyone has something valuable to say. The 1% of people who study delivery and copywriting generally stand out.
1515304749779853316 2022-04-16 12:23:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MandaGummer I dunno. Never led a funding round.
1515304678875185154 2022-04-16 12:22:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EarthToDaniel Thanks, Daniel!
1515304548411322372 2022-04-16 12:22:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rawimistry  https://t.co/IJVfpewYMz
1515304515926466562 2022-04-16 12:22:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrissha3 2x-3x per day. It's on a schedule, yes.
1515304366709874688 2022-04-16 12:21:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Carlos_Scheuch Threads were the thing that started my growth trajectory moving much faster. I spent a lot of time researching the top thread creators on Twitter.
1515304209029152776 2022-04-16 12:20:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi I tend not to let Twitter impact my mental health that much by curating a smart, supportive following. Anyone who starts impacting my mental health gets blocked immediately.
1515303981093994496 2022-04-16 12:19:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith I dunno. I ask myself this all of the time.  Right now it's freedom and flexibility.  I think, ultimately, I'll go back to working with a small group of people I trust and admire to solve a problem.
1515303536313122819 2022-04-16 12:18:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ADHDJobs They are getting people who have obviously cracked the code of attention to monetization. They likely bring a much different perspective than the average employee.
1515303239750672386 2022-04-16 12:16:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DONVESH  https://t.co/XFQkSNZyCC
1515303091104583681 2022-04-16 12:16:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlanJLSmith  https://t.co/IJVfpewYMz
1515303070904815621 2022-04-16 12:16:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HustleJoy Nope.
1515302805925466113 2022-04-16 12:15:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AtulAGhorpade I'm not sure. I haven't built a SaaS with no-code.
1515302667844829187 2022-04-16 12:14:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tylersuomala It's not about a follower number as much as it is about signals/requests from your audience.  Once you get asked for help about the same topics many, many, many times, that's a good signal.
1515302533568286726 2022-04-16 12:14:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimplyAzodo I don't really think of my Twitter followers as money. That's awfully transactional.  I think of Twitter as a place where I'm building a name for myself that supports my business and future businesses.  If I were starting from scratch, I'd probably do it the same way. LinkedIn.
1515302185050980357 2022-04-16 12:12:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @funnygangwal What have you accomplished that other people want to accomplish but can't figure out?
1515302089563557890 2022-04-16 12:12:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets It's not about being similar to another platform. It's about asking yourself why people should pay attention to you. What have you done, specifically, that other people want to do but can't figure out?
1515301850609815552 2022-04-16 12:11:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @malikrajat_ I'd:  1. Decide what I want to be known for specifically 2. Share one tip each morning that helps other people 3. I'd engage with 3-5 high-performing accounts in the same space each day 4. I'd write one thread per week going deeper on a specific topic.
1515301596158218240 2022-04-16 12:10:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheAmineAouragh I leveraged knowledge that I had acquired over the course of my life and then watched how other popular creators formatted their Teweets to make sure I delivered my information in a similar fashion.
1515301399365627905 2022-04-16 12:09:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Mostly commenting underneath large accounts with very high-quality responses.
1515301279765045250 2022-04-16 12:09:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd Definitely.  It's much shorter and slightly more complex.
1515301125817311240 2022-04-16 12:08:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copywithkush Helping people.  People tell me stories about quitting their jobs, building businesses, helping their families, etc.  It's pretty awesome.
1515300887815729162 2022-04-16 12:07:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets I read your bio. You talk about how to "live a more fulfilling life", but that's a bit nebulous.   And, why should someone believe that you can help them? I'd focus more on nailing that down versus writing more Tweets.
1515300432754708486 2022-04-16 12:05:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @supermodi I don't have a team. It's just me. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question?
1515300309974794246 2022-04-16 12:05:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MrDigitalAyush Happy to answer specific questions.
1515299834105847810 2022-04-16 12:03:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've added 70k Twitter followers in 19 weeks.  AMA while I'm on a train for the next 2.5 hours.  I don't have all the answers but can try my best.
1515289865239281668 2022-04-16 11:23:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dagorenouf @rajendrazore Ha. True story, man.
1515289837565272068 2022-04-16 11:23:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @naman_designs This is awesome. Thanks, man!
1515268691054768130 2022-04-16 09:59:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaviningham Great stuff, Gavin. Thanks for the nice mention! 🙌
1515253367248990210 2022-04-16 08:58:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RoryTanner Thanks, man!
1515253228279156736 2022-04-16 08:58:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zelmanow Thank you, Ari!
1515252991561015304 2022-04-16 08:57:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonstrimpel I automate anything that I do more than 2x per week. It's different for everyone. Emails, newsletters, templates.  I delegate things that are administrative like helping people log into a course, processing a refund, or other things like that.
1515252651616841728 2022-04-16 08:55:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @braden_mosley You're welcome. Thanks for getting started!
1515252546444701703 2022-04-16 08:55:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Motzlbd This is awesome, thanks, Motaz!
1515252482347352065 2022-04-16 08:55:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stevewinroad Happy to have you, Steve.
1515252400860377088 2022-04-16 08:54:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena Most: Sharing results in public.  Least: If you don't know, say so.
1515252203535151107 2022-04-16 08:54:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianCarmody @heyeaslo @jacobm @mindvalley @dickiebush @heyblake Thanks so much for the mention here, Brian!

1515051161086312452 2022-04-15 19:35:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5 hard lessons from 32 months of self-employment:  - If don't know, say so - Eliminate / automate / delegate - Share results in public → get attention - Chase short-term $ → miss long-term $$$$ - Expertise + consistency + persistence → top 1%
1515041744282259457 2022-04-15 18:57:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @braden_mosley Thank you man!
1515041605727637507 2022-04-15 18:57:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @soundslikeryan @dickiebush Sign up. You won’t be disappointed.
1515017500194443276 2022-04-15 17:21:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @girl_thriving Looking forward to having you as a customer.

1515014360900460546 2022-04-15 17:09:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most solopreneurs can 2x their rates.  If not more.  It just requires following a simple 4-step plan:  - Feedback - Iteration - Testimonials - Increase prices  I break it down for 17,933 creators in my newsletter tomorrow morning.

1515007238586388483 2022-04-15 16:40:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artinkaz I generally just support everyone who wants to do something interesting. More of that please.
1515007121892515844 2022-04-15 16:40:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @salnjr Funny how that works huh?
1515007024987349002 2022-04-15 16:39:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yourpalomar I think they are often projecting their own fears.
1515006902316457986 2022-04-15 16:39:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @malikrajat_ Ha. True.
1515006779486310412 2022-04-15 16:38:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RajKSarma 100
1515006756035903494 2022-04-15 16:38:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis @Nicolascole77 I was worried about it until I realized it cost about 6 course sales to pay. Then I just made a plan.
1515006632572379140 2022-04-15 16:38:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Thank you, my man. You are who you are surrounded by.

1514947118775033863 2022-04-15 12:41:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThusSpokeRahul Sure is, Rahul.
1514947068657344521 2022-04-15 12:41:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @prvsomani Encouragement from those who understand is so helpful.
1514946975547936774 2022-04-15 12:41:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @omarakhaddaj Exactly.
1514946938755588104 2022-04-15 12:41:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyKMedia Always happens that way.
1514946891192352769 2022-04-15 12:40:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP That’s such a common thing I hear, Greg.
1514946771226705931 2022-04-15 12:40:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Sad.
1514946691887247366 2022-04-15 12:40:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @anorsich That’s the right way to approach it, IMO.
1514946534177185793 2022-04-15 12:39:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanWritess Yep. 20M+ laid off. Risky.
1514946466992828423 2022-04-15 12:39:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Great advice
1514942890719551489 2022-04-15 12:25:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tell people you hate your job &amp; nobody bats an eye.  Tell people you're going out on your own &amp; get lectured on risk.
1514882920116277255 2022-04-15 08:26:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @capt_nandu @AliAbdaal @MeetKevon Thanks, Nandu!
1514855261516832769 2022-04-15 06:36:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendancahill_ @typeshare_co Congrats, man!
1514855140016242693 2022-04-15 06:36:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomwicky @heyeaslo Thanks, Tom!
1514714036700692486 2022-04-14 21:15:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley Secret: Jennifer is obsessed with haggis. I'm now on board.
1514713350743236613 2022-04-14 21:12:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley Not about you, my friend :) We loved seeing you!   London is great. In Edinburgh right now. A bit too touristy but nice architecture. London is our jam for sure.
1514711249665286150 2022-04-14 21:04:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DgtlMike Oh, I believe it!
1514710497345613829 2022-04-14 21:01:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley I don't even know what subtweeting is, but if it's good, I'm doing it. If it's bad, I'm not doing it. 😂  Did you make it back with dog in tow?
1514704239922135048 2022-04-14 20:36:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @by__Ilia It almost always is.
1514704190966317059 2022-04-14 20:36:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @constructionge3 True story, Eric.
1514704093973041160 2022-04-14 20:36:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CheetSheets So far. It's true.
1514704035978354694 2022-04-14 20:35:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach There's no specific important question. Just a genuine curiosity to learn about other people.
1514703907393519620 2022-04-14 20:35:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sladeerickson It's true.
1514703879748866049 2022-04-14 20:35:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto I feel like curiosity springs when we're comfortable with our own life.  Talking and interrupting comes from the need to position ourselves as something we aren't in an attempt to impress.  It's not advice per se, but it's just an observation.
1514703595115003905 2022-04-14 20:34:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @indefiniteloops @Nicolascole77 I do. Every once in a while I take a call from an intro and I'm surprised when it goes the way it does.  This Tweet was more in reference to people I meet in everyday life. I'm just surprised by how much people talk and interrupt...
1514697646123933698 2022-04-14 20:10:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Can I pick your brain (aka can I brain dump in an attempt to impress?)
1514688719529332744 2022-04-14 19:35:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm amazed by how many adults talk nonstop, interrupt constantly, and never ask questions.  Learn to listen and be curious.  Your life (and business) will drastically improve.
1514668289439506436 2022-04-14 18:13:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DgtlMike Of course. You can’t understand their problems if you don’t listen to, and engage them. Table stakes.
1514667527204397067 2022-04-14 18:10:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jabuto_Jabuto Thanks man!
1514647676322779136 2022-04-14 16:52:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Rafa_G_K Really enjoyed it, Raf! Thanks for having me on.
1514641283607900160 2022-04-14 16:26:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yourpalomar No, you're right. I meant the latter, I was just rushing 🤦‍♂️
1514639159780159495 2022-04-14 16:18:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 😂
1514639096215449606 2022-04-14 16:17:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro Make it easy, bridge a gap, win customers.
1514639035393789966 2022-04-14 16:17:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yourpalomar The former is what so many people do. Confuse to impress themselves.
1514638918347542534 2022-04-14 16:17:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RichaaVaid Always, Richa.
1514636846239789056 2022-04-14 16:08:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco 100%. This is where metaphors come in handy, too.
1514636326112579594 2022-04-14 16:06:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh Always, Harsh.
1514636277752213508 2022-04-14 16:06:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheophaneJean Use your customer's language for sure.
1514635571653754890 2022-04-14 16:03:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sladeerickson Smart people simplify. Confused people complicate.
1514635117213491206 2022-04-14 16:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tech people love jargon. Customers love clarity.  Impress those who matter most.
1514628724649512960 2022-04-14 15:36:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew @dickiebush Great thread man!
1514624630513930248 2022-04-14 15:20:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylegawley Definitely. I just specialize in solopreneurship.
1514615482954911758 2022-04-14 14:44:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ModestMitkus @AlexMaeseJ @OzolinsJanis @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @jessievbreugel Thank you man!

1514614258092322830 2022-04-14 14:39:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michael_kove @ZainabRose96 Sandler levels of awareness through discovery.
1514613961659879437 2022-04-14 14:38:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Definitely. Add a transformation and you’ve got a good chance of closing the deal.
1514613848438837250 2022-04-14 14:37:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writingtoriches If executed well!
1514613798535016458 2022-04-14 14:37:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti I usually just make a simple recommendation. That often works well.
1514613682382127113 2022-04-14 14:36:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Yep. Constantly chatting up your customer base unlocks so much more information.
1514581239012937730 2022-04-14 12:28:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dovhyi 100% it does
1514581181261664257 2022-04-14 12:27:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shaynmtl One of the best sales formulas out there.
1514581069101678594 2022-04-14 12:27:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Brett_Trainor Absolutely. Can’t always build a product or service around non-painful problems.
1514580901426089994 2022-04-14 12:26:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @serenaded_ Never easy. But incredibly effective.
1514579290267996160 2022-04-14 12:20:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6 steps to more customers:  - Understand your customer's biggest problem - Translate the problem to business impact - Tell stories about solving that problem - Share the transformations - Craft an irresistible offer - Show them how to buy
1514516625206226945 2022-04-14 08:11:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RobCeceNJ That’s awesome, man. So happy to hear that! Keep it going.
1514515196638896129 2022-04-14 08:05:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @katairobi @austin_rief @amandanat @wes_kao @nathanbarry @mdeziel @jimmy_daly Thanks, Robert!
1514484460640772096 2022-04-14 06:03:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gouthamjay8 @CSMikeCardona @HeyItsSophiaO @hypefury @webflow @typeshare_co Appreciate you, Mike!
1514484366256361477 2022-04-14 06:03:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shock_lab Thanks so much, Mike!
1514484330919337985 2022-04-14 06:02:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel I'd focus on a mix of being discovered through short-form social media content and showing your expertise through longer-form content like a newsletter or podcast.

1514326331978358793 2022-04-13 19:35:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship 101:  - Learn a skill at work - Consult with that skill for a reasonable rate - Learn about your customer's most pressing needs - Niche down to solving only that and raise your rates - Productize everything else you learned and sell it online
1514287504039501826 2022-04-13 17:00:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @AlexAndBooks_ @SahilBloom @blakeaburge Thank you man!
1514274984977440779 2022-04-13 16:11:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arnimpr Yep. My goal is to avoid things I hate.
1514274939087560707 2022-04-13 16:10:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @deanbdwyer Mostly my time. I spend 90 minutes per day walking with my wife at the park. We go out to lunch all of the time. It's wonderful.
1514274832950730754 2022-04-13 16:10:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @artinkaz Definitely. I feel that, Artin.
1514272755272884235 2022-04-13 16:02:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurs goals should start with lifestyle, not money.  Filthy rich and burned out sucks.   Moderately wealthy and free is heaven.
1514268235574747138 2022-04-13 15:44:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Love that. You would have thought I'd put it into a system, but I don't need to since y'all have!
1514267366481350663 2022-04-13 15:40:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Appreciate you, Teddy!
1514267270175993861 2022-04-13 15:40:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sladeerickson @jmventurelog Thanks, man!
1514226146505895946 2022-04-13 12:57:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JosephMaule Brevity mostly.
1514226080827252738 2022-04-13 12:56:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt 100%. That's where the viral stuff usually ends up...

1514222516830670848 2022-04-13 12:42:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the_remote_club Looks like I hit a few. That's the ticket right there.
1514222465936990209 2022-04-13 12:42:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PRINCELY_ARTs Nice!
1514222393874599941 2022-04-13 12:42:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd I teach, challenge, and empathize. I'm not a super entertaining writer so I don't try.
1514221605257453568 2022-04-13 12:38:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davharts Experiment!
1514221508138307585 2022-04-13 12:38:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito You rock, Kelly. Thank you so much for the mention.
1514220146029641731 2022-04-13 12:33:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito Sweet! Where can I read it?
1514220029994319879 2022-04-13 12:32:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EarthToDaniel Very often. But in this case, they tend to underthink things.
1514219529265684485 2022-04-13 12:30:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito Very few people actually teach for free. I try to do this daily.
1514219460361699331 2022-04-13 12:30:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Nailed it, Dennis.
1514219432234659846 2022-04-13 12:30:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IndyDevDan 100%. Great content has these outcomes.
1514219366925148171 2022-04-13 12:30:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Yep. I bucket that under "makes me think".
1514219332464779267 2022-04-13 12:29:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Definitely. The intersection of 2-3 is powerful.
1514219287438897154 2022-04-13 12:29:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realAlexChapple Haha. True.
1514219265406160897 2022-04-13 12:29:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoftedLearning Definitely.
1514219244610805767 2022-04-13 12:29:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @serenaded_ Makes me think.
1514219233068171273 2022-04-13 12:29:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sarvamwriter Education.
1514219178575769601 2022-04-13 12:29:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mrbooktook1 Could easily fall under "makes me think".
1514219101614448641 2022-04-13 12:29:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Diego23862434 You should aim for one in every piece of content.
1514219037982605314 2022-04-13 12:28:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @separmeen Sure, but content doesn't really save money or time, unless it educates.
1514217647306588167 2022-04-13 12:23:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 types of content builds a following:  1. This person teaches me 2. This person entertains me 3. This person makes me think 4. This person understands me  That's about it.
1514217373473120263 2022-04-13 12:22:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tibo_maker Yeah, I think so. It wasn't even from my content 😂
1514208073564528651 2022-04-13 11:45:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sptroy Yes, another Twitter user mentioned me in a thread. Had nothing to do with my posts, just luck from producing so much content.
1514179120392925185 2022-04-13 09:50:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rubenkenes @dvassallo @arvidkahl I think we all got mentioned in the same Twitter thread. Just luck 😀

1514153632198975491 2022-04-13 08:08:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nathanaprice @ManjhunathRavi @heyeaslo 100%. Rising tides lift all ships.
1514153546291240961 2022-04-13 08:08:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heychazza I don't think I qualify yet based on my account size.
1514153449730068484 2022-04-13 08:08:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Reza_Kabiri_ Appreciate it. I didn't do anything except get mentioned in someone else's Twitter thread 😂
1514153145181609989 2022-04-13 08:06:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eitan_levy101 Appreciate it, Eitan.
1514153097010024452 2022-04-13 08:06:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanWritess Someone mentioned me in a Twitter thread that went pretty viral.

1514152809024962562 2022-04-13 08:05:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ayaaaansk Awesome, Ayaan.
1514152773041987585 2022-04-13 08:05:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanWritess It was thanks to someone else
1514152722152497152 2022-04-13 08:05:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi I got mentioned in a Twitter thread by @heyeaslo   That dudes got the Midas touch :)
1514152629902921728 2022-04-13 08:04:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heychazza Nah. No verification for me.

1513647779779948552 2022-04-11 22:38:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RileyTrembath It's simple, but the consistency is difficult.
1513647717507022848 2022-04-11 22:38:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikestottwp People asking to learn more, hear more, get more details, tell you how valuable something is, etc.
1513647373599268874 2022-04-11 22:37:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pvukovic @TwemexApp One of my favorite plugins on Twitter.
1513647332826492942 2022-04-11 22:37:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti The steps are simple. The execution is difficult.
1513647264861933580 2022-04-11 22:36:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @J_wilkinson Yes, definitel.
1513647237687132163 2022-04-11 22:36:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nick_sutedjo The right people + the right idea + the right mission + the right balance. Even then, it's a 100:1 long shot.
1513647061459259394 2022-04-11 22:35:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LearnBigIdeas Definitely. Compounding works almost everywhere...
1513646964763762689 2022-04-11 22:35:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal It definitely will. Great point, Ali.
1513646919452700672 2022-04-11 22:35:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen 100% they do. Too many people pound away without ever stopping to analyze or listen.
1513514789632282625 2022-04-11 13:50:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @e_stradella This is awesome. I love it
1513514210654752775 2022-04-11 13:48:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kengohth This is mostly just Twitter
1513514106547888133 2022-04-11 13:47:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OlegLustenko It's all simple. Most people just don't stick with it.
1513513997651234816 2022-04-11 13:47:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Great tips man. Love it.
1513513929342742534 2022-04-11 13:46:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Absolutely. Approach it like you're helping one person each day
1513513793845792768 2022-04-11 13:46:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @o0Aditi0o What's resonating
1513513736790675467 2022-04-11 13:46:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @feelthebyrn1 Love this
1513513681748836352 2022-04-11 13:45:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adityatheverma Yep. Start simple and don't give up.
1513513499468582915 2022-04-11 13:45:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ZachEHackett Yep. Many people just crank content and never analyze.
1513513459991732232 2022-04-11 13:45:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Now I have a much more sophisticated content calendar, ecosystem of partners, long form newsletter, etc. But at it's core it's not too different.
1513513066880589831 2022-04-11 13:43:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LuxurySkills @WizardsofIncome I didn't forget it. It's just table stakes.

1513510345293316101 2022-04-11 13:32:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sunilc_ Good tips.
1513496725956313091 2022-04-11 12:38:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CobirulHoque @AuthorOnTheSide Threads worked early for me. I think most people just take some time to understand how to write good ones.
1513493604496556032 2022-04-11 12:26:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Someone asked me a great question:  What would I do if I were building online from scratch?  My answer:  • Share a simple tip each morning • Engage in 3 to 5 quality conversations per day • Share deeper insights 1x per week via a Twitter thread  And then listen for signals.

1513134457728946181 2022-04-10 12:39:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @touseefcodes And you meet excellent people.
1513134420416417792 2022-04-10 12:38:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MMcCreesh It's worth it for the people alone.
1513134395946938373 2022-04-10 12:38:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_KavinPrasath Yep. Exactly.
1513134348878417923 2022-04-10 12:38:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness Yep. I'm not looking for RTs. I'm just looking to build relationships. Growth is simply an outcome.
1513132599627206656 2022-04-10 12:31:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter observation:   Replies are a great way to grow.  (And meet extremely talented &amp; cool people)  https://t.co/9L7mgTs6vc

1512910876415827977 2022-04-09 21:50:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Thanks for having me man!
1512823459482673154 2022-04-09 16:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to sell more:  Pay attention to how you buy.
1512531259997790209 2022-04-08 20:42:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_IlirAliu @AngeZanetti @revue @getrevue @Kajabi I use Revue to have a newsletter banner on Twitter but pipe them through to Kajabi using Zapier.
1512499994867245065 2022-04-08 18:37:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PeakTobi @CoreyWilksPsyD @Nicolascole77 Thank you, Tobi!
1512477168059957251 2022-04-08 17:07:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MeshRHM I'm so glad to hear that, Mesh.
1512477141706891267 2022-04-08 17:07:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kellen_the_man Thank you, Kellen!
1512474843714928644 2022-04-08 16:57:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito @KeithKeller @HeyJennyLee @rosemary_egbo @CelesteMohan @writes_eve @lukematthws @Podcasts4Profit @tomkuegler7 I don't have time for more live calls, so I prefer courses where I can learn at my own pace.
1512449194077868033 2022-04-08 15:16:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamsimm0 @ItsKieranDrew @thedankoe Appreciate you, man. Thank you.
1512412396018712586 2022-04-08 12:49:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @guerrist @dvassallo @elonmusk Please don't! :)
1512410798798344196 2022-04-08 12:43:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gunnerkid Really good advice.
1512410697325498371 2022-04-08 12:43:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Yep. One of my go-tos.
1512410635040169990 2022-04-08 12:42:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jakobgreenfeld I love that advice. Going to give it a try on my own.
1512410272333545475 2022-04-08 12:41:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiharikaSodhi Definitely, Niharikaa.
1512408085805023237 2022-04-08 12:32:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv I love that Dhruv.
1512408048991625224 2022-04-08 12:32:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejonasme Yep. Ship and learn.
1512408021653143554 2022-04-08 12:32:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PRINCELY_ARTs Write and edit at 2 different times.
1512407947007115267 2022-04-08 12:32:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiallRatcliffe I love that addition, Niall.
1512407913909862400 2022-04-08 12:32:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmdrapp You're welcome. Thanks for reading it, Derek.
1512407877780185094 2022-04-08 12:31:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fab_rosato Definitely, Fabio. Ship it.
1512407834402639874 2022-04-08 12:31:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CobirulHoque Cut 30% of the words.
1512406176696258564 2022-04-08 12:25:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're struggling to produce written content:  - Start writing your piece - Take a break for 30 - Come back - Cut 30% - Publish  Process, not perfection.
1512393160646930440 2022-04-08 11:33:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @elonmusk I have been impersonated 51 times in 5 months.   A few of my followers have been scammed (bitcoin, of course) and it's to the point where I think it's highly brand damaging.  Someone will eventually start a class-action lawsuit.
1512189652148666377 2022-04-07 22:04:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendancahill_ @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush @typeshare_co YES! Love seeing it. Congrats man.
1512103002395525130 2022-04-07 16:20:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sarvamwriter Thank you, Sarvam!
1512101569424236549 2022-04-07 16:14:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Definitely. Stay the course, watch it compound.
1512101493192765442 2022-04-07 16:14:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theakarshit Exactly.
1512101445595713536 2022-04-07 16:14:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hustlenconquer That's absolutely amazing. I wouldn't have guessed that.
1512101343984562178 2022-04-07 16:13:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gentoftech 100%, Michael. Only downside is if we say something stupid :)
1512099559157252103 2022-04-07 16:06:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 💯 upside
1512099131241766916 2022-04-07 16:05:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @josuevallesp Nailed it.
1512099051650658307 2022-04-07 16:04:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Certainly!
1512099028544147456 2022-04-07 16:04:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdsMenace It definitely does, especially once it compounds.
1512098984029999113 2022-04-07 16:04:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gobienan That's how I think about it.
1512098958528684036 2022-04-07 16:04:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv 100%. Unless you say something terrible.
1512098759274074119 2022-04-07 16:03:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Pracheetah Limited Partner.
1512098707394674704 2022-04-07 16:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach It's why I don't take brain picks.
1512098642420772869 2022-04-07 16:03:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi @Nicolascole77 100%. It's how I get written stuff done.
1512098524057546761 2022-04-07 16:02:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michael_kove 100%
1512098475583889415 2022-04-07 16:02:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @J_wilkinson True. I won't do back-to-back though. Too difficult.
1512098408655433732 2022-04-07 16:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Because I write online each day, I've:  - Become an LP - Landed clients - Met new friends - Built 4 digital products - Done hundreds of podcasts - Built a private community of 600+  I have no idea what each piece of content will do.  But it's basically 100% upside.  Publish.
1512098388547969030 2022-04-07 16:02:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen Yes, I agree with this. I do this as well.
1512098260386816009 2022-04-07 16:01:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Itsjarredbell @thepatwalls created one of the greatest sites in the world, IMO.   https://t.co/nfndtZqC6N
1512098051929817091 2022-04-07 16:00:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MySuccessTheory SO much.
1512098020829057025 2022-04-07 16:00:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendancahill_ It's my favorite way to keep myself from being distracted.  P.S. My VA should have reached out to you. Cheers.
1512097850129268737 2022-04-07 15:59:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hackernewbie Same. Or try my hardest to have zero meetings.
1512097777169358850 2022-04-07 15:59:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlizaKr Ha, that's so great. Thanks for sharing!
1512097660831940624 2022-04-07 15:59:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaviningham This is basically how I live.
1512054804641685507 2022-04-07 13:08:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarrisFanaroff - Brain picks - Podcasts - Presentations
1512048038767964163 2022-04-07 12:41:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Same.
1512048005364465664 2022-04-07 12:41:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Much more. It's why I mute everything and funnel all outreach to a VA.
1512047906852909060 2022-04-07 12:41:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bradleywriting Emails and Slack notifs are the worst at breaking concentration. I turn everything off during work mode.
1512047815412924419 2022-04-07 12:41:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @feelthebyrn1 Yep. I funnel everything to a VA now, and review a document with a summary of outreach each evening.
1512044554521915393 2022-04-07 12:28:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi I find even pausing to take notes takes me out of my flow.  I just shut down everything and focus. I assume, if it's important, I'll remember.
1512044433478500359 2022-04-07 12:27:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd 100% Dr. E
1512043300215267334 2022-04-07 12:23:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jjxe_ It definitely does. Therefore I try to timebox everything important.
1512042561644417024 2022-04-07 12:20:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Time management 101:  Keep context switching to a minimum.  30-minute meetings end up costing you 1 hour in lost productivity.  The deeper you get into your business, the more important it is to be wise with your time.  Write out templates for saying no to anything.
1511870042136354816 2022-04-07 00:54:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena @jayclouse @wes_kao @dunkhippo33 @SahilBloom @stephsmithio Thank you!
1511820483364331522 2022-04-06 21:37:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshdviner Thank you man!
1511818225318834180 2022-04-06 21:28:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @constructionge3 @JamesonCamp I just priced it at what I would feel comfortable paying for it. That's always been my strategy.
1511818077926789120 2022-04-06 21:28:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gus_tiffer 1. How to get attention 2. How to hone in on signal 3. What does my audience want? 4. How can I deliver that? 5. How can I scale that?
1511817818316103693 2022-04-06 21:27:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianCarmody This is awesome. I love it!
1511765437914230785 2022-04-06 17:59:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann I find helping, supporting, being compassionate, etc. to be things I love.   Doing them can be hard work, but not something I "don't like". I find that to be rather exciting and meaningful work. I love that kind of work.
1511762953808326656 2022-04-06 17:49:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreszannelli Ha, thanks. It's in my board deck.
1511762890705022979 2022-04-06 17:48:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IndyDevDan Thanks, man :)
1511762869297328128 2022-04-06 17:48:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Imene_Maharzi I like this GIF.
1511762823889793030 2022-04-06 17:48:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @landforce It really is.
1511762797465587723 2022-04-06 17:48:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stevenshills20 I think so too, Steve.
1511762772287184906 2022-04-06 17:48:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NinaGreimel Ha. Thanks, Nina.
1511762723213877251 2022-04-06 17:48:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew This is awesome, Kieran.
1511762689617534978 2022-04-06 17:48:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Nada.
1511762596931723266 2022-04-06 17:47:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I think so too. Not there yet, but trying.
1511762442275143691 2022-04-06 17:47:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Yep. Like most stuff worth doing, it's never easy.
1511762390223933451 2022-04-06 17:46:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aurasky_ Tryin!
1511752550613196808 2022-04-06 17:07:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Thanks, Teddy!
1511752513955012608 2022-04-06 17:07:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writes_eve I think certain people figure it out faster, and sure some folks might be more naturally inclined.   Do you have a large following?
1511752365115949068 2022-04-06 17:07:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @noahedelman2 Figure out their biggest pain points, and build something that solves them. Then ask.
1511752290818043909 2022-04-06 17:06:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tom_SkinnerBC Kajabi
1511751999376740362 2022-04-06 17:05:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Great collection here, Jessie!
1511736007820988421 2022-04-06 16:02:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My business plan is to avoid things I don't like.
1511735124920094720 2022-04-06 15:58:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @constructionge3 @JamesonCamp Q1: Zero. I don't run ads ever.  Q2: Just one. All of my courses are one-take, no editing, and one version.  Q3: I love Gumroad, but eventually I wanted to host everything in one place, website included.
1511729998469922817 2022-04-06 15:38:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nonstack Make a lot of noise and look for signal.
1511729998192861195 2022-04-06 15:38:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nonstack Make a lot of noise and look for signal.
1511729981373796354 2022-04-06 15:38:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LockedinPerform My inclination is the latter.  Test out what it feels like to sell something, build something, deliver something, etc.  Don't go all-in until you actually know you enjoy the process and people want to buy what you're selling.
1511729786976194575 2022-04-06 15:37:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nonstack This article will tell you how I did it:  https://t.co/F98NuBhT9r
1511729689823436809 2022-04-06 15:36:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito @coach_avinash @NiharikaSodhi Maybe "impulse" isn't the right word.  What I meant was that if people are on the fence, they are more likely to buy something that's $150 vs. some $797 "masterclass". Those price points require incredibly deep trust.
1511729330656796674 2022-04-06 15:35:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv I started in late 2018 because I knew I was leaving my full-time job.  So, I started writing as much as I could to figure out what resonated with people. Once I understood that, I doubled down on what worked and stopped what didn't.   I built the product once people asked for one
1511729149278359553 2022-04-06 15:34:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje I'm not sure there's a right order, but at some point you should deepen the relationship with your audience via community.  I gave everyone in A&amp;I early access at a greatly reduced price.
1511728934429286404 2022-04-06 15:33:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach It's my full-time job :)
1511728882424205319 2022-04-06 15:33:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @landforce Mostly because of my goals of working less vs. making more. I already make enough money to be satisfied.  Cohorts take a lot of my personal time and I want to do less of that.  The best answer on pricing here:  https://t.co/nB2K89t4En
1511728313739395075 2022-04-06 15:31:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @milenaregos I shared something on a video podcast and people went wild. I was like..."Oh. I should build this into a course"  And the course was born...
1511728195317510151 2022-04-06 15:31:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LearnInAwe Q1: Presell the idea. Don't build it unless people buy it.  Q2: Timebox it to 14 days, keep it simple and affordable. Only after you presell and get some validation.  Q3: Everyone has impostor syndrome. Create for the folks a few years behind you on their journey.
1511727900466335755 2022-04-06 15:29:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copywithkush I definitely don't. Plenty to learn!
1511727430611918850 2022-04-06 15:28:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW I don't know, to be honest.  I think if you want to make something really long and detailed, you'll need a high price point to get high completion rates.  For me, I like to help people do one thing really well, in a short period of time, for a reasonable cost.
1511727292489293832 2022-04-06 15:27:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IamAndrewEllis Yes.

1511727048208883712 2022-04-06 15:26:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TBWPpodcast I don't think it's important. I think webinars are kind of 2018ish.
1511726978658971652 2022-04-06 15:26:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorVenkatesh I'm not sure, but I would go with whatever makes it easiest for you to get started. Worry about tools and tech once you've proven you can stay consistent.
1511726852133605379 2022-04-06 15:25:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @indiejuan Neither really.  Happiness isn't tied to those things. Those are just fleeting moments of dopamine.  Happiness is receiving messages via LinkedIn and Twitter when people start using what I write to build a better life. I get those daily.
1511726597174435845 2022-04-06 15:24:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelkirsten That was the day I announced it.
1511726402088939529 2022-04-06 15:23:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Added a new channel (Twitter) and used a recent event (S30for30 podcast) to drum up a ton of interest.
1511698394523258881 2022-04-06 13:32:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theandreboso My hypothesis is that at $50 I would have more customers, similar revenue, higher refund/problem accounts.  My hypothesis is that at $250 I would have far fewer customers, similar revenue, lower refund/problem accounts.  $150 gives me a ton of WOM and good customers.
1511697578240454664 2022-04-06 13:29:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejimhart  https://t.co/zSnmbhgkNY
1511697494169767937 2022-04-06 13:29:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dcgunner I never really "sell".  I talk about problems I hear people having and I present a solution and then ask people to buy it.  Not too salesy :)
1511697310618636289 2022-04-06 13:28:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @malikrajat_ No, I did not. I've never wanted someone ghostwriting my social media content.  I considered having someone write blogs many years ago for my SaaS advising business, but never followed through.
1511695733140996108 2022-04-06 13:22:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dooneroisin - LinkedIn - The shorter, the better completion rates (obvious in hindsight) - No, I didn't waste much time this time around. I have before trying to find the perfect tech instead of just using what I know.
1511695454597177348 2022-04-06 13:20:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brennan_decker Thanks for the mention, Brennan!
1511695146269786112 2022-04-06 13:19:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheophaneJean I did not. I expected to do that in a month, not 2 weeks.
1511695060391317507 2022-04-06 13:19:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD Thanks, Tom. Plenty of people doing it way better than me. Just figuring it all out.
1511694190387908610 2022-04-06 13:15:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeRuffing4 @ImraneSubstack That's your job to make them aware through awareness marketing.
1511692029448835073 2022-04-06 13:07:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup Truest thing I've read on the internet today.
1511691255906021383 2022-04-06 13:04:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tutors_primary Selling is just helping people solve their problems.  You need to understand your customer and their biggest desires and problems that keep them from reaching those desires.  That's your product.  Once you have it, you need to learn how to write copy to position your product.
1511690388695879684 2022-04-06 13:00:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @heyblake @PavedEmail @TheTiltNews Thanks for the mention, man!
1511690080334848002 2022-04-06 12:59:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanisRenaud I'd build an audience first around a very specific topic. I'm not sure a milestone is needed, but I'd look for overwhelming signals that people want more knowledge from you.
1511688605374238723 2022-04-06 12:53:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jkruman I like the intersection of what you enjoy, what you know a lot about, what people want to know more about, and what people will pay you for.  I wrote an article that might be helpful:   https://t.co/TwgI63yXsp
1511688102644961284 2022-04-06 12:51:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_lincourt8 Ever deviate from the one umbrella topic I talk about.
1511688010613542920 2022-04-06 12:51:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Alex_Swenson14 I am. It's not perfect, but so far I'm loving it.
1511687920306032644 2022-04-06 12:51:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gyaan_central Build an audience around one very specific topic. Basically, become known for something.  Then, build a small coaching business. Learn as much as you can and productize what you learn.
1511687753788014595 2022-04-06 12:50:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThisIsAnmolJain Not building a big enough audience around one very specific topic. If you don't do that, nothing else matters.
1511686094051495947 2022-04-06 12:43:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NicheDown Thanks, Michael!
1511686005258076174 2022-04-06 12:43:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro Response from the Ship 30 for 30 podcast with Dickie and Nicolas. People reached out en masse to ask about it, so I built it.
1511685850207330309 2022-04-06 12:42:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_ZionSpirit_ I'm not sure if there's a "best" place, but try to play where you enjoy creating.  I like to write, so I use Twitter and LinkedIn. If you like video, try YouTube. If you like to record, try a podcast.
1511685495541145602 2022-04-06 12:41:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide I could probably figure it out, but I don't have it at the moment. Will dig in though.
1511685412217102340 2022-04-06 12:41:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd My first launch did about $75k in 18 months. I think I made like $5k during the launch month.
1511684140504076295 2022-04-06 12:35:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DivyanshLalwan5 No. Start simple and use a platform that exists.  Prove your idea out over the long term and then build your own thing.
1511684014691729412 2022-04-06 12:35:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack Talk to them and ask them about their problems. Once you hear the same problem many, many times over, the next thing you need to do is validate that they would be willing to spend money to solve it.
1511683872173576193 2022-04-06 12:34:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_ZionSpirit_ Definitely. That's what I've been working on building for 3+ years.
1511683689515737098 2022-04-06 12:34:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steve_P_Brady I'm hoping there's a lot of good questions.
1511683645953789956 2022-04-06 12:34:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister Thanks, Steven!
1511683530136424450 2022-04-06 12:33:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DivyanshLalwan5 2.9% to Stripe and the platform is $199/month.
1511683387819544579 2022-04-06 12:33:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_ZionSpirit_ - Had all the features I wanted - Yes, I showed my system on a live podcast and people loved it so I built a course around it. - $150. I price it where I would feel comfortable buying it and where I think people will pull the trigger easily.
1511683180159459331 2022-04-06 12:32:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Starts with a launch spike and then decreases gradually over time until it normalizes.  I refresh a few times per year.  I have zero marketing spend. All organic.
1511682965272735750 2022-04-06 12:31:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @himanshugoel_me Become known for one very specific thing. Why should someone pay attention to you and ultimately purchase something from you?  Hone in on that and never stop.
1511682809991208969 2022-04-06 12:30:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Thanks, Kieran!
1511682661575708674 2022-04-06 12:30:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BigBadKale Becoming known for one very specific thing online.
1511682551970254848 2022-04-06 12:29:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chinar_amrutkar Thanks, Chinar!
1511682503576367106 2022-04-06 12:29:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito Thanks, Kelly!
1511682457459990532 2022-04-06 12:29:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ayushtweetshere I just liked all of the built-in features it came with for running my newsletter, subscriptions, and building out my whole website.  No, I don't want to discount my courses down for those platforms.
1511682301842890765 2022-04-06 12:28:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets I don't think there's a "follower count" number that unlocks releasing a product.  I think it's more about becoming known for one very specific thing, and then paying attention to how many people in your audience ask you for help.  Once you see that often, you can probably build.
1511681546847240192 2022-04-06 12:25:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VicPivots LinkedIn, Twitter, and my email list.   I chose them because that's where my audience is.   I wish I had a sexier answer.
1511680926417309696 2022-04-06 12:23:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I just crossed $125k  in 16 days on my new course launch.  Ask me anything.  I don't have all the answers, but I can give you my perspective.  👇🏻  https://t.co/enS56ReUxj
1511463882258362376 2022-04-05 22:00:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamie_dru Congrats, man. That's amazing!
1511432375070248967 2022-04-05 19:55:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendancahill_ @TweetsbyCoachP Kajabi
1511431609727209487 2022-04-05 19:52:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendancahill_ @TweetsbyCoachP Thank you so much, man.
1511430617463939090 2022-04-05 19:48:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendancahill_ @TweetsbyCoachP So cool, man. Glad to see you're getting some incredible traction. It's never an exact science, but a fun one to play with!
1511425413297451008 2022-04-05 19:27:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @gjsequeira @notion @felix12777 @learnwithvidya @notion4creativs @JhumanJ @JanelSGM I use this guy:  https://t.co/hA79L6HyuS
1511388232323411973 2022-04-05 17:00:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lukematthws It's not lazy. It's the opposite. It's recognizing the value of your time.  My time is extremely valuable. The faster I can learn something, the better.   I'd rather learn something from someone who knows how to do it over searching down a rabbit hole of people who don't.
1511385766550769666 2022-04-05 16:50:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanWritess It's a great book.
1511385715569012737 2022-04-05 16:50:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thestevenmellor @lukematthws Yes. You also pay for the aggregation.
1511385641711718401 2022-04-05 16:49:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JavascriptDon $50-$150
1511385613601234961 2022-04-05 16:49:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lukematthws I don't think anything can just be YouTubed. I think my LinkedIn OS has a lot of stuff nobody has put on YouTube.  Many courses definitely can.  People don't always pay for the info, often they pay for the aggregation though. Especially people who have limited time.
1511385376941871112 2022-04-05 16:48:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd Yep. Or building up their audience.
1511385316946554885 2022-04-05 16:48:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito I just mean make it easy for people to "pull the trigger". The more impulse buy pricing, the more likely people are to say yes and then it's on your deliver 100x value.   https://t.co/NLVBSbb715
1511351290491805712 2022-04-05 14:33:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisisming Heck yeah. Glad it was helpful!
1511327227547471879 2022-04-05 12:57:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt That's awesome. I love that, Danny.
1511327180931878916 2022-04-05 12:57:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach Yep. Forgot the last step :)
1511327148711321608 2022-04-05 12:57:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Really good advice. I use @blackmagic_so and it tracks my streak so I never want to break it.
1511322293284360197 2022-04-05 12:38:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aimanjawedd We generally overcomplicate things.
1511322239026794496 2022-04-05 12:37:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @words2wealth Definitely a good one.
1511322197046054925 2022-04-05 12:37:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Smart move, Dennis.
1511322170995232771 2022-04-05 12:37:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aurasky_ Love it, Sathya. I feel like prompts just keep me extremely focused.
1511319043738935300 2022-04-05 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yeahcopy You're welcome!
1511318993893830662 2022-04-05 12:25:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fab_rosato Certainly. These are simple, but effective.
1511318703551438852 2022-04-05 12:23:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito Thanks for reading them, Kelly.
1511318669770567680 2022-04-05 12:23:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Definitely, Manjhunath.
1511318111823269901 2022-04-05 12:21:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imtreyshields There's usually something true inside of humor. Suss it out.
1511318057087647746 2022-04-05 12:21:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_sampoyan 100% it can, Sam.
1511317524280922117 2022-04-05 12:19:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Writing every day is hard.  Here are 4 prompts to make it easier:  - What's 1 thing I learned today? - What's 1 interesting thought I had? - What's something someone taught me? - What did my partner and I have a laugh about?  Then?   Find 30 minutes to write about them.

1511028236733628426 2022-04-04 17:09:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fab_rosato @arvidkahl The problem should be related to time or money.
1511028192458547208 2022-04-04 17:09:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tejas3732 @arvidkahl That's a good line to follow.
1510970930905894914 2022-04-04 13:21:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dudehere @AliQOfficial @AliAbdaal Thanks, fellas!
1510969001509363714 2022-04-04 13:14:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tim_Denning @Seanjkernan @Ayotheauthor @Nicolascole77 @creation247 Thanks, man!
1510967860750954502 2022-04-04 13:09:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_andreanara Thank you :)
1510967210239533064 2022-04-04 13:07:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 Thank you, Tobi!
1510967210235289602 2022-04-04 13:07:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkhundmiri @kylepdotco Thank you, Mustafa. Means a lot man.
1510967164337102849 2022-04-04 13:06:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Definitely. I'm not very good at this, so will likely outsource.
1510966557018578949 2022-04-04 13:04:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_andreanara Awesome. Glad you enjoyed the course, Andrea! Thanks for being a customer, I appreciate it.
1510961941027639300 2022-04-04 12:46:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylepdotco Appreciate that, Kyle.
1510961898669416449 2022-04-04 12:46:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_IlirAliu @SahilBloom @agazdecki @Harshmakadia @OneJKMolina Thanks, man!
1510960867898273794 2022-04-04 12:41:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zainabrose96 Thanks, Rose.
1510960840651980805 2022-04-04 12:41:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_andreanara Definitely. Those are table stakes.
1510960792115552256 2022-04-04 12:41:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aimanjawedd Most of good marketing and selling is Psychology based.
1510960735970824192 2022-04-04 12:41:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @janahan888 Appreciate your time, Janahan.
1510960705243078656 2022-04-04 12:41:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen Yeah, these are great.
1510957525058953219 2022-04-04 12:28:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Brett_Trainor Definitely. A soft skill that is a requirement.
1510957426031398923 2022-04-04 12:28:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @funnygangwal  https://t.co/2KU3JhKCXG
1510957346171805697 2022-04-04 12:27:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @espressocopy Yes, they are definitely different skills IMO.
1510957280501587975 2022-04-04 12:27:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schemingbilly It's definitely one of them.
1510957245672169475 2022-04-04 12:27:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi It's certainly important.
1510957139862372352 2022-04-04 12:27:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd They can be super common. No need to disrupt.
1510957084048871425 2022-04-04 12:26:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito Nice! Sounds like a good post.
1510956760735133697 2022-04-04 12:25:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Exactly. Create interest through your stories and then have a viable solution.
1510955973728481285 2022-04-04 12:22:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3 skills every solopreneur needs:  - Problem-solving - Telling stories - Copywriting  1. Solve a big problem. 2. Make it relatable through a story. 3. Talk about it daily to attract customers.
1510701633201655808 2022-04-03 19:31:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @codewithnico @DavidVanMtl I’m not treating it as inferior at all.   I’m just sharing how my own mindset and focus changed.   Being an employee can be awesome. I did it for  16 years.

1510689572149202946 2022-04-03 18:43:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann @jackbutcher @SahilBloom @dickiebush Yep. It is hard. Most of the charitable work I do isn’t tied to online, it’s offline.   I’m looking at a sponsorship that might change this.
1510687410425843721 2022-04-03 18:35:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lucaslunzmann @heyecs @waitbutwhy Thanks for the shout!
1510684915846860811 2022-04-03 18:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlinaOkun Thank you, Alina!
1510657616229416961 2022-04-03 16:36:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann @jackbutcher @SahilBloom @dickiebush I did drive 21,000+ unique visitors to a site I created to help Ukraine in just 3 days.   https://t.co/kzmfIHnbfr  It was then adopted and passed around The Peace Corp. Not too shabby.  😀
1510611883912540162 2022-04-03 13:35:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro That's where I'm at now...
1510611003465244676 2022-04-03 13:31:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Definitely, Dhruv. Focus becomes easier on the things that matter.
1510610558508318723 2022-04-03 13:29:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NinaGreimel 100%, Nina!
1510610515839565834 2022-04-03 13:29:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @getbetterwithnb I think so too, Nikhil.
1510610490388623361 2022-04-03 13:29:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @funnygangwal For me as well, Shubham.
1510610450060300289 2022-04-03 13:29:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nerita_ll Nice, Nerita!
1510608205637951493 2022-04-03 13:20:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When I worked a 9 to 5, I cared about:  - Job title - Salary + OTE - Number of direct reports - What peers thought about me  As a solopreneur, I care about:  - Health - Network - Free time - Creativity - Time with my wife - Location independence  A wonderful mindset shift.
1510277976625135622 2022-04-02 15:28:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NiharikaSodhi I love this, Niharikaa.
1510249093746118663 2022-04-02 13:33:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulElijas Thanks, Paul!
1510247417203109892 2022-04-02 13:26:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tejas3732 Exactly, Tejas.
1510247387230580737 2022-04-02 13:26:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArrigoLupori Thanks. I think it's just slowing down and being aware.

1509997407399993351 2022-04-01 20:53:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bot5amz It should be taped to people's monitors.
1509997363489914885 2022-04-01 20:53:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mike_Klemmer Seems like it. So many get it wrong.
1509997305780310018 2022-04-01 20:53:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chidiebere_ama :)
1509997293180706828 2022-04-01 20:53:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManjhunathRavi Exactly.
1509997257982160896 2022-04-01 20:52:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zurieljeffre Try to help as many people as you can. Answer questions, share what you have, etc. Eventually, you'll become well known. That's part of relationship building.

1509944978285416452 2022-04-01 17:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DOBCapital I'm excited to send it.
1509943511520530433 2022-04-01 17:19:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach We're all stuck in certain areas. Just sharing as I learn.
1509943462380150786 2022-04-01 17:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii I'm here to deliver it :)

1509933658538496002 2022-04-01 16:40:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamie_dru I like to take walks with my wife. That's my favorite.
1509876059902300160 2022-04-01 12:51:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WrongsToWrite @rize_io Oh cool. I'll check it out!
1509876022002528256 2022-04-01 12:51:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jkruman Really smart, Jeff.
1509875983729532930 2022-04-01 12:51:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @umut_sonmez I love hearing that, Umut!
1509875896647401478 2022-04-01 12:50:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_beaumont Great questions, Bruce.
1509871585263603717 2022-04-01 12:33:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pattyroxaschua Great system. One of the originals. I found tweaking it slightly for me worked well.
1509871476794613760 2022-04-01 12:33:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MyBuddyAndrew Yeah, I'll bet you're right.
1509871149441863685 2022-04-01 12:31:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tanoy27 Good additions. Thanks, Tanoy.
1509870944323620895 2022-04-01 12:30:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyjoeyjustice That's a great framework. I like it.

1509870449164959745 2022-04-01 12:29:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann Great questions.  I swap kids for wine though.
1509870332156563456 2022-04-01 12:28:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MyBuddyAndrew Working well?
1509869459699388440 2022-04-01 12:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I’ve started doing a weekly audit of my time.  I ask myself:  - What gave me energy? - What took energy away? - What can I easily eliminate? - What tasks need to be automated? - Is there anything I can outsource?  How do you review your time spent?

1509575153889550342 2022-03-31 16:55:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @e_stradella The Minimalist Entrepreneur by @shl
1509568488003805191 2022-03-31 16:29:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Yep. Find great people. Create great community.
1509568430176886785 2022-03-31 16:28:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls Literally 99% of the time. It's wild.
1509568379925024776 2022-03-31 16:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Same. It comes across my feed naturally, and I help when there are problems in the world.  But I won't seek out information with the sole intention of getting myself riled up.
1509567692549894148 2022-03-31 16:25:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Well said.
1509565024334979076 2022-03-31 16:15:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ApexMindAdam @BenjaminPutano @tomberryCD Yes. I won't connect with any political talking heads.
1509564890616414210 2022-03-31 16:14:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @maffeodrinks It's the most positive change I've made.
1509564828188299266 2022-03-31 16:14:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writer_xoemxo They are, but I'd rather not be bombarded.
1509564786819878921 2022-03-31 16:14:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JacobSuckow Yep. My own small ecosystem.
1509564748249063433 2022-03-31 16:14:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD @BenjaminPutano Same here. I won't listen to anything intentionally divisive.
1509564663519920129 2022-03-31 16:13:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wherrmann1 That's exactly it.
1509564624856915979 2022-03-31 16:13:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryansatkinson Nobody want to read you sh*t is a fave.
1509564475409674245 2022-03-31 16:13:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @roddaut You have to.
1509564441230258178 2022-03-31 16:13:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eugenecheang I like "How I Built This" and "$100 MBA".
1509561683936792577 2022-03-31 16:02:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The daily news is miserable.  So I surround myself with:  - Great books - High performers - Uplifting podcasts - A motivated community - A positive Twitter audience  I'm going to brainwash myself before the world can.
1509555935232020483 2022-03-31 15:39:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AtulAGhorpade @ayushtweetshere It's suspended already. It's happening daily. Twitter has a problem.
1509548550711136268 2022-03-31 15:09:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nookrecruiter Appreciate the shout here, Michael.
1509548523800473602 2022-03-31 15:09:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nookrecruiter Thank you my man.
1509517150544924672 2022-03-31 13:05:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @g3Mo @aurasky_ @starryeyedak Most courses never get finished, therefore the audience never gets the value. Make them easy to consume (short).
1509513022947082249 2022-03-31 12:48:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Great list, Dickie. Here's one:  If you can't teach yourself, you'll always be a liability.  All of these pieces of advice became easier to execute when you stop asking other people what to do and start learning on your own.
1509509850933383176 2022-03-31 12:36:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @7Printz @dickiebush @OneJKMolina @waronweakness @colinyjchung @JoshuaLisec @thedankoe @GrammarHippy @The_MMW @creation247 @writingtoriches @WrongsToWrite Thanks, Kevin 🔥
1509509729713897478 2022-03-31 12:35:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Simple solutions win.
1509509694393659396 2022-03-31 12:35:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArrigoLupori Great! It's helpful not to spend 50 hours on something only to find out people don't want it. Ya know?
1509508169265033221 2022-03-31 12:29:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @radhikaparekh_ Correct. It must solve one pain point.
1509508105402466311 2022-03-31 12:29:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArrigoLupori For your first one, just keep it simple.  Presell it before you build anything. If people buy it, build it.   If they don't, don't.
1509507017358123014 2022-03-31 12:24:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bhawanaasharma Yeah. I generally keep mine below $200.
1509506959678259202 2022-03-31 12:24:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls I like to start with a service, learn everything I can about how to best deliver the intended outcome and then productize it.
1509505815715196932 2022-03-31 12:20:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you are building an online course, stop.  You must have these 3 things:  - A problem your audience says is painful - A specific outcome in mind for the student - An outline to solve that in 60 minutes or less  Alleviated pain + high completion rates = happy students
1509500834240999424 2022-03-31 12:00:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandondigital Appreciate you, man!
1509500804323020806 2022-03-31 12:00:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LynnRivest Glad you like the simplicity. Thanks for the shout.

1509265659531866125 2022-03-30 20:25:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @constructionge3 Try interesting things.
1509265593047920647 2022-03-30 20:25:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bradleywriting That can definitely be frustrating.
1509265531429396480 2022-03-30 20:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OscarLagrosen Very cool, Oscar!
1509265488198750209 2022-03-30 20:25:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AngeZanetti Yes. Exactly!
1509265468623933441 2022-03-30 20:25:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RitwikSrivast11 Good luck!
1509265452366712836 2022-03-30 20:24:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @The_MoBiz Certainly.
1509265436340273160 2022-03-30 20:24:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SikiraAmer Definitely. But having them offline is a good start.
1509265366408732683 2022-03-30 20:24:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JasonHershman That's exactly it, Jason.
1509265341083443204 2022-03-30 20:24:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 Yep. That's a good way to measure it.

1509242406625067011 2022-03-30 18:53:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ncpchealth I think you misunderstood what I meant by transaction here.  The transaction is just them trading their time to read what you wrote. I'm just simply suggesting that you're writing must be good enough to create that transation.  How do you do it? Transformation is one great way.
1509242068127956996 2022-03-30 18:52:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @topher_hammond @AlexAndBooks_ @ColinandSamir @polina_marinova Thank you, Topher!
1509226742346563596 2022-03-30 17:51:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copywithkush Nope! This is a book called Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t
1509216075082260489 2022-03-30 17:08:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CarlosPero Ha.

1509216023798501383 2022-03-30 17:08:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @josuevallesp Creating an experience. Solid. Good stuff.
1509215971667591171 2022-03-30 17:08:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arulvelan85 Damn, I love that.
1509215940679979018 2022-03-30 17:08:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fab_rosato Definitely. It's why I make courses short and affordable with the intention of surprising and delighting with 100x return.
1509215849961476096 2022-03-30 17:07:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyforcreators It's something we all come to realize over time.
1509215805430538247 2022-03-30 17:07:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChristineCarril I wish too, Christine.
1509215765546913797 2022-03-30 17:07:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArrigoLupori Thank you so much, Arrigo.
1509215722265882635 2022-03-30 17:07:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD Absolutely. Read your own content and ask "would I be happy I spent time reading that?"

1509215517835509767 2022-03-30 17:06:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevLinguistic Absolutely. Put 100% effort into these things.

1509160190465163270 2022-03-30 13:26:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This👆🏻 Exactly this.
1509152864014381056 2022-03-30 12:57:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imThomasMorales @tferriss Ooh. I love that.
1509152804404965383 2022-03-30 12:57:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena I feel very similar, Melissa.
1509152763300782090 2022-03-30 12:57:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Awesome, Dennis!
1509146799260504065 2022-03-30 12:33:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd Yep. Or if you have a 9 to 5, use it to fund your future one-person business.
1509146697863208962 2022-03-30 12:33:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew True story, Kieran.
1509146665743171584 2022-03-30 12:32:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hiyabodhi I look at it differently. I think considering your options and potential for failure is smart. Just have a plan.
1509146513280225287 2022-03-30 12:32:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dhruvpipebagger Definitely. You can build toward this slowly while you have a job.
1509145570862153731 2022-03-30 12:28:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BuzzRobTaylor Agreed, Rob.
1509145546296070147 2022-03-30 12:28:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomgarcy Exactly. Great stuff, Tom.
1509145509885362185 2022-03-30 12:28:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanWritess That's how I think, Armaan.
1509145458748317701 2022-03-30 12:28:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theorencohen Don't stop working. Pay your debt. Tinker with a side project in your free time.
1509145381397049344 2022-03-30 12:27:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach Definitely. Find a supportive network and you're much more likely to succeed.

1509144726196338694 2022-03-30 12:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Always some slight risk, but riskier never to try.
1509144599289380870 2022-03-30 12:24:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Thanks so much for having me on, Hassan.
1509144202533289985 2022-03-30 12:23:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> More people should try solopreneurship.  It's not as risky as you think.  - Likely worst case is you go back to work. - Likely best case is you unlock a better life.  Feels riskier never to try.
1509142063161528322 2022-03-30 12:14:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisWalker171 @dereknielson @ShaanVP @carrd I don't feel like it's intentionally contrarian.   I just feel like you have a better understanding of modern marketing, and therefore that puts you at odds with antiquated techniques that are parrotted by most.  That's what makes you the CEO and leader you are.

1508912367840768007 2022-03-29 21:01:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kadavy That's awesome 😀  I like courses so I make 'em.   I love walking through my systems on video and making it easy to understand and then updating it in real-time for the students.  Sounds like we're both doing cool stuff. Writing a book must be hard. I don't think I could do it!
1508910786810417162 2022-03-29 20:55:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kadavy Yeah, that's a pretty darn good approach.  I enjoy talking to people who have built businesses and just building on my own and making a bunch of mistakes.   Usually 20% the former, 80% the latter. But, again. That's just me.
1508907962483499014 2022-03-29 20:44:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kadavy The average business book is crammed with filler content, and people love business books.  Most chapters are around 5-10 pages of strategic or tactical info followed by numerous example stories.  I don't need examples. I assume it works if the person is an expert in their craft.
1508906242764427274 2022-03-29 20:37:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kadavy Definitely not the only one.  I think different mediums exist to help different learning styles.  For example, I'd rather learn a business concept in a video course for 45-minutes than try and get through a 300-page book filled with 250 pages of filler content.  That's just me.
1508905475630370822 2022-03-29 20:34:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @russleads @dickiebush I don't agree with this entirely.  I think cohorts are great for some people.  I think courses are great for some people.  Personality-dependent.
1508898800110379022 2022-03-29 20:08:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Thank you so much, my man. Massively appreciated.

Give it a watch.

1508847521325588483 2022-03-29 16:44:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd 14/ When people ask questions, share the link  Now, when people ask questions, you can share your brand new link.  Sure, some people won't book, but some will.   And if 3-4 people do, you're paying off that mortgage faster than ever.  Congrats! You have your first side hustle.
1508847519190732805 2022-03-29 16:44:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd 13/ Continue focusing on the problem you solve  The next part is critical.  Keep creating that red pill content!  Now that you have your business set up, you're ready to drive customers.  Push out content daily on LinkedIn/Twitter or anywhere else you normally hang out.
1508847516921602052 2022-03-29 16:44:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd 12/ Add the link to your social profiles  Attach your Carrd landing page to a custom URL and add it to your social pages.  - Twitter Bio - A personal website - LinkedIn featured section - Your YouTube Page  And anywhere else that people can find you online.
1508847514740535304 2022-03-29 16:44:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd 11/ Open up a few slots outside of your 9 to 5  Pick a few times outside of your 9 to 5 where you'd like to make a bit of extra cash.  Maybe it's just 3-4 hours per week, but if you fill those slots, that's an extra $2,000 or more per month.  That's some people's mortgage!
1508847512559497221 2022-03-29 16:44:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd 10/ Choose a reasonable price point  Start with a price that people are willing to pay.  But make it 2x to 3x what you make at work.  For example, if you make $100k at work, that's basically $50/hour.  Try $150/hour.  Experiment often to find the sweet spot.
1508847510009397252 2022-03-29 16:44:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd 9/ Create an event: "From X to Y in 60 minutes"  The more specific you can make the outcome, the better.  It's not: "Learn to code"  It's: "From clueless to coding your first HTML page in 60 minutes."  The outcome is clear.  You'll learn to code your first page in HTML.
1508847508021293061 2022-03-29 16:44:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd 8/ Open up a Calendly account  Open up a Calendly account &amp; embed it on your landing page.  This provides a frictionless, seamless way to get people into your calendar for your new business consulting/coaching.  Now, let's make it easy for people to understand what they'll get.
1508847505999642631 2022-03-29 16:44:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP @carrd 7/ Embed 5-8 testimonials  Social proof helps close deals.  Ask the 10 people you helped for free to write you some.  Tell them to talk about the problem they had and how you solved it.  Put the testimonials near the top so people see them.  Get some near your "buy" button.
1508847500857389065 2022-03-29 16:44:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP 5/ Create a standard process  Once you understand the problem, you need a solution.  But it's best when standardized.  A step-by-step process that predictably delivers high-quality results for the people you intend to help.  This is a more scalable process than ad-libbing it.
1508847498693124104 2022-03-29 16:44:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP 4/ Chat with 10 people for free  Work to get 10 people on Zoom who have the same problem.  A problem you can solve with your "red pill" thinking.  Do deep discovery in 4 levels:  L1: Technical problem L2: Historical problem L3: Financial impact L4: Personal impact
1508847496428236804 2022-03-29 16:44:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaanVP 3/ Look for questions + DM opps  When you create content like that, you're going to get questions.  Questions present opportunity.  When you're just starting, leverage a combo of public/private responses.  Answer questions publically, and take it to DM to add deeper context.
1508847494385606663 2022-03-29 16:44:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Create "red pill" content around one challenge  "Red pill" content is something I heard @ShaanVP say and I've never forgotten it.  Your content should present a new take. A new angle.  A different approach than other people take to solve a challenge.  Be different.
1508847492217061379 2022-03-29 16:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Clean up your profiles  Your social media profiles are mini landing pages.  With one glance, prospects should know:  - Who you help - What you help them do - How you help them do it  Capture attention by being clear, not clever.
1508847489734127619 2022-03-29 16:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> By the end of this thread you will have:  1. Clear social profiles 2. "Red pill" content 3. Deep customer knowledge 4. A standardized service business 5. Simple technology to run it 6. Great social proof for it 7. A seamless process for making $$  Let's go ⬇️

1508783370423132167 2022-03-29 12:29:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_andreanara Just studying how others were building theirs.  I realized it about a year ago or so...
1508783291268227080 2022-03-29 12:29:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabbart_  https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE
1508783144681488384 2022-03-29 12:28:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD Community is a key ingredient for sure.
1508783098724556804 2022-03-29 12:28:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writes_eve Nice, Eve!
1508783051983179789 2022-03-29 12:28:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TMitrosilis Oh for sure, Teddy.
1508783023344467976 2022-03-29 12:27:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @separmeen I create weekly for social and newsletter.  I timebox course/product creation.
1508782912371625995 2022-03-29 12:27:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach Certainly. Thanks for your support, Marlene!
1508780784601243651 2022-03-29 12:19:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The biggest mistake I made as a solopreneur?  Not having a Creator Funnel.  Back in 2019, I had zero plan.  Now, I:  - Get discovered (social) - Deepen trust (newsletter) - Build relationships (community) - Monetize (products and services)  Creator Funnel = predictable revenue

1508542768364331012 2022-03-28 20:33:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I love the idea of being a category king. Such a great term and really paints a picture of how to act. I've written something similar before and referred to it as a "niche of one".  Good stuff today.
1508528150388609030 2022-03-28 19:35:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What's the best online course you've taken?
1508497181715709955 2022-03-28 17:32:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush @patio11 This is maybe one of the greatest things I've read. Ha.  Thanks for sharing it, man.
1508489110599708678 2022-03-28 17:00:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD Exactly. I think people think of promotion as always selling.  It's really about sharing your thoughts and ideas every day. That's just free promotion.
1508488129841446921 2022-03-28 16:56:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenhannna Yep. Just writing to myself today.
1508488034219696138 2022-03-28 16:55:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Ain't that the truth. Been meeting cool people left and right.
1508487195946110984 2022-03-28 16:52:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matt_Mastando Some downside but very minute in comparison to the upside.
1508487083337392133 2022-03-28 16:52:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henwalkco I sure hope so, Henry.
1508487047278964736 2022-03-28 16:51:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ishiid I appreciate it, Dai.
1508487009312153610 2022-03-28 16:51:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thecodetutore Thanks, man!
1508486721306046473 2022-03-28 16:50:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanHaha Thanks, Armaan.
1508486339607597061 2022-03-28 16:49:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Promote yourself online every single day.  - Your work - Your brand - Your opinions - How you think  People will either:  - Love you (customers) - Hate you (who cares) - Join you (network) - Follow you (students) - Ignore you (already are)
1508477570865577996 2022-03-28 16:14:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GuillaumeMbh Well, shit man. Thank you! I'm honored.
1508423729956675588 2022-03-28 12:40:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @McLovin_Murat @harrydry Love StoryBrand.
1508423691318796294 2022-03-28 12:40:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LoftedLearning @harrydry Definitely!
1508423631831023617 2022-03-28 12:39:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joelshansen @harrydry He sure does, Joel.
1508422149043798017 2022-03-28 12:34:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith @harrydry @Austen That sounds like a book I should pick up. Thanks, Daren.
1508421556720046095 2022-03-28 12:31:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ModestMitkus @harrydry Excellent additional advice.
1508421450767781891 2022-03-28 12:31:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MattRubinstein1 @harrydry Certainly. Thanks, Matt!
1508421422531686409 2022-03-28 12:31:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv @harrydry This simple outline has worked wonders for me.
1508420178111041550 2022-03-28 12:26:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When building landing pages, @harrydry says:  1. Explain the value you provide (title) 2. Explain how you'll create it (subtitle) 3. Let the user visualize it (visual) 4. Make it believable (social proof) 5. Make the next step easy (CTA)  Still the best guidance I've found.  https://t.co/uHMKIYP54D
1508408156510208009 2022-03-28 11:38:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito @Tweetinggoddess Thank you, Kelly!

1508133604169289736 2022-03-27 17:27:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kimdoyal Thank you, Kim!
1508133516269269000 2022-03-27 17:27:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets The proof is in the pudding, ya know? Congrats.
1508114734075326477 2022-03-27 16:12:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Thanks so much for the shout, Alex. Appreciate it 🙌🏻 Great thread.
1508064242116829188 2022-03-27 12:51:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tobymyleswrites Thanks so much, Toby!
1508063715496763395 2022-03-27 12:49:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @muskmarketeer 😂
1508062271821467649 2022-03-27 12:43:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tejas3732 @corner_aff Typically you'll see PAS.  I like to an the I (intrigue) and P (positive future)
1508062197037125638 2022-03-27 12:43:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vrsceo Thanks, Varun.
1508062147527557122 2022-03-27 12:43:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanHaha Haha. Not at all. Love it. Thanks, man.
1508061961203949570 2022-03-27 12:42:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl Reading. Check ✅  https://t.co/7R6qXE2Jfk
1508061092865531908 2022-03-27 12:39:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanHaha I think that's a good thing?
1508060302599987212 2022-03-27 12:36:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Copywriting lesson:  Pain: generate pain with writing Agitate: turn the knife until it's worse Intrigue: present an intriguing alternative Positive future: paint a picture of a better future Solution: provide a solution that brings people there
1507807060926373896 2022-03-26 19:49:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damienpahulu Thanks, Damien! 🙌
1507796988435345410 2022-03-26 19:09:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisbits92 Nice!
1507796974371803142 2022-03-26 19:09:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanHaha This is almost always true.
1507796926623846402 2022-03-26 19:09:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aryan_kochhar I looked for areas where I continuously fell back to doing things in a manual fashion and continued to figure out ways to chip away at that with automation.
1507796782285262850 2022-03-26 19:09:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vegardwikeby Oh definitely. Systems for everything.
1507796677549248521 2022-03-26 19:08:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Powercommitment Consistency is often the outcome of having great systems. I think failure comes from relying only on willpower alone.
1507796467678855169 2022-03-26 19:07:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ModestMitkus One of my faves.
1507796436162912268 2022-03-26 19:07:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikhail_kochkin Certainly, it can. Especially if it works every time.
1507796327614275588 2022-03-26 19:07:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Nice!
1507796290649919496 2022-03-26 19:07:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Denis__Shatalin Agreed 100% here.
1507796264930484225 2022-03-26 19:06:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @podfixer101 When creativity fails, systems are there.
1507796214925963267 2022-03-26 19:06:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Absolutely. Systems are in place to keep from failing.
1507796118037569537 2022-03-26 19:06:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_IlirAliu @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi I used Gumroad forever. I loved it. Kajabi allowed me to bring my whole business together under one roof.
1507762797807124482 2022-03-26 16:53:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_peterlister  https://t.co/zSnmbhgkNY  It comes with 2 templates included but there's a small upsell for 5 monthly.
1507749995008643074 2022-03-26 16:03:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The easiest way to improve your writing is to improve your systems.

1507725669333147650 2022-03-26 14:26:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith I feel like it's perfect for landing pages. Thanks for reading it, Daren!
1507720573505482760 2022-03-26 14:06:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blondwayfarer @FerracoFTW @LinkedIn Thanks 🙌 See ya there.
1507716535317630982 2022-03-26 13:50:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyandcheese I thought it needed a slight update!
1507716489083772929 2022-03-26 13:49:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steve_P_Brady Give it a whirl. It takes a lot of practice over time.
1507711752338821120 2022-03-26 13:31:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @famndingers What an awesome compliment. Thanks so much for it, Mike.

1507444157996019718 2022-03-25 19:47:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 I’m not sure. Just started testing. Will let you know though!

1507395087910772745 2022-03-25 16:32:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jousefm2 So many of those stories too...
1507395050610769924 2022-03-25 16:32:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heychazza I know I used to.
1507395017878482946 2022-03-25 16:32:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArmaanHaha That's exactly it, Armaan.
1507394897619394579 2022-03-25 16:32:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @podfixer101 Ha. Love that, David.
1507394799548178449 2022-03-25 16:31:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_IlirAliu Thank you! I'm starting to reach a place where I need a VA though.
1507394662063128583 2022-03-25 16:31:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NinaGreimel Definitely. I just meant it's not always related to business success, when maybe I should have said revenue.
1507394565422129168 2022-03-25 16:30:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GPastural For sure.
1507394521654566964 2022-03-25 16:30:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Yep. Sometimes it's that they paid enough people to spread their stuff.
1507394357535678464 2022-03-25 16:29:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Exactly. That's the lesson right there, my man.
1507394294839234563 2022-03-25 16:29:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Ha. For sure!
1507393796664868868 2022-03-25 16:27:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Some people have 100k Twitter followers and make $10k/year here.  Some people have 10k Twitter followers and make $100k/year here.  Followers aren't a proxy for business success.
1507378615645790213 2022-03-25 15:27:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Robert_Galena Appreciate it, man. I just put the finishing touches on it, and I'm excited to send it out.
1507339748972679222 2022-03-25 12:52:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cyberstripes Thanks, TJ!

1507333878553485319 2022-03-25 12:29:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Singhcredible Smart. I always do this.
1507333848916500485 2022-03-25 12:29:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iarifahmad Lots of folks recommending this.  Going to give it a try and see how that works for me.
1507332931026661377 2022-03-25 12:25:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls I like it. It's so funny. Some people are saying "let it rip" and others are saying "let it marinate".  Per usual, no "right" way to do things.
1507332659978113029 2022-03-25 12:24:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jthomas__ Haha. Good to know.
1507331815278841861 2022-03-25 12:21:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_JTomlinson I like this one...I usually do both. Going to try my best to separate.
1507331219096281095 2022-03-25 12:19:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Alec_Coughlin Smart.
1507331102721167400 2022-03-25 12:18:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ayushtweetshere Yep. Smart.
1507331049017196545 2022-03-25 12:18:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matt_Mastando Yes. Love that, Matthew.
1507331012933701648 2022-03-25 12:18:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamie_dru Yep. That's step zero.
1507330972878086145 2022-03-25 12:18:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jthomas__ Interesting. Do you ever just let it rip?
1507330539983982618 2022-03-25 12:16:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Damn. Good stuff, Dhruv.

1507167011822096391 2022-03-25 01:26:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 @AdamRy_n @KateBour @andymewborn @arihappywick @social_savannah @ianrborthwick Thank you, my man :) Very appreciative.  You're right there on marketing. Give this man more attention!
1507078567880007688 2022-03-24 19:35:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Who is an up-and-coming creator you would invest $10k in?   (with zero hesitation)
1507064829718245387 2022-03-24 18:40:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @raine_street I track it using analytics tools like Shield for when I write on LinkedIn and  https://t.co/jL3msQbh7x for when I write on Twitter.
1507064627821228035 2022-03-24 18:39:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikhail_kochkin I've built systems to fall back on for when I'm not feeling super creative.
1507037015975641109 2022-03-24 16:49:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realjefflarge It's kinda weird because my personal life is also sort of my professional life. But generally writing content, newsletters, etc.
1507029765819088903 2022-03-24 16:21:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zaid_BinAdam Started with SaaS sales and have pivoted as my life has changed.  I write mostly on LinkedIn, Twitter, and my newsletter.
1507029665558450187 2022-03-24 16:20:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CBrandonDillon No. I'm new to writing on Twitter regularly. Started about 18-19 weeks ago.  I have nearly 200k followers on LinkedIn where I started writing 40 months ago.
1507029498847539200 2022-03-24 16:20:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @binno_james I'm not, but I've been a guest on their podcast.
1507029432204251146 2022-03-24 16:19:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @navdeepsoni I have a whole 4-part system.   https://t.co/zSnmbhgkNY
1507029328441266181 2022-03-24 16:19:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenmostrom Yeah, being cognizant is a huge part of it.
1507029271881129996 2022-03-24 16:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NinaGreimel Looking fwd to seeing 'em
1507029238007967745 2022-03-24 16:19:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ashoukry Yes. I write every single day from 12:15p to 1:30p in my office. I rarely miss.
1507029106281615364 2022-03-24 16:18:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eugenecheang It's gotten much easier over time, thankfully.
1507029064405721089 2022-03-24 16:18:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena It's literally the thing that keeps me going.
1507028998467076102 2022-03-24 16:18:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @muskmarketeer Thank you!
1507028956876357635 2022-03-24 16:17:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steve_P_Brady True, but I don't write for "people".
1507025710581440523 2022-03-24 16:05:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @podfixer101 It's true with nearly anything, ya know?
1507025629987971072 2022-03-24 16:04:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wadboy_ We all fail sometimes. Just write the next day!
1507025583397613570 2022-03-24 16:04:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DividendIncome_ I love this.
1507024967665389572 2022-03-24 16:02:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I committed to writing daily 40 months ago.   Here are my results:  → 87.8% adherence → 1,750+ unique pieces → 250,000+ new followers  Not 100%, but what a wild journey.  I'm convinced habitual writing makes any entrepreneur better.
1507024224103317513 2022-03-24 15:59:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro Think about the long-term implications of being tied to something you might not like doing, and then find a way to test it out without commitment.
1507024006146363392 2022-03-24 15:58:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pradologue @tibo_maker Appreciate that fellas!
1507023942481059843 2022-03-24 15:58:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonbrosio @richroll @Casey @guyraz @HowIBuiltThis @ramit @RyanHoliday @hubermanlab @RobertGreene @jaltucher @marieforleo @ThisIsSethsBlog @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @joerogan @naval @BreneBrown @JamesClear @mikeroweworks @JordanHarbinger Thanks for including me here, Jon.

1507007767692730385 2022-03-24 14:53:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JasonHershman Thank you for such a great thread. Cheers, Jason!
1507007629104599051 2022-03-24 14:53:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JasonHershman Boom! Love to hear it man,.
1506978635600826372 2022-03-24 12:57:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel  https://t.co/LF88jF7zUY
1506977378584735744 2022-03-24 12:52:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @liviumlabs Yeah. Usually it's just trolls and nitpickers. I'm Mutumbo with the block button over here.
1506976937255870468 2022-03-24 12:51:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HelloKade Look at the data. What drives revenue? What drives attention? What do you work hard on that does almost nothing?   Do more of the former and less of the latter.
1506973270435848193 2022-03-24 12:36:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DOBInvestments Sure. Take tons of small risks. Double down on what works, throw away what doesn't.
1506972876552949764 2022-03-24 12:35:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenpratley I think so. I like building a portfolio of products because it can always grow.
1506972674148421640 2022-03-24 12:34:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hexybrands  https://t.co/yA6J1Pmegw
1506972656767225859 2022-03-24 12:34:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thestevenmellor Audience first is a 100% must.
1506972585954881543 2022-03-24 12:33:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets For sure. Love that, Ant.
1506972542417969152 2022-03-24 12:33:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks That's awesome, Sergio. A great thing to educate founders on.
1506971673349832707 2022-03-24 12:30:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenpratley For me, it means not getting wrapped into lengthy projects that don't have an exit.  Want to try something? Make sure you like it before committing to 12 months.  That's what I meant. Thanks, Stephen!
1506971036444733450 2022-03-24 12:27:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adamkreek Thank you, Adam. The more popular you get, the more you attract people who want to bring you down.  I'm not an arguer. I'm just a guy who prunes noise.
1506970347584819209 2022-03-24 12:25:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SvenSlattum @_hannahahn  https://t.co/InTODEA5V4
1506970210481364997 2022-03-24 12:24:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsbradleyjay Thanks, Bradley.
1506970191020040201 2022-03-24 12:24:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StressUndone Important stuff.
1506970157180194826 2022-03-24 12:24:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArtSpaceOfGrace For sure.
1506970124472958984 2022-03-24 12:24:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_hannahahn Sure. Don't wrap yourself into a year-long journey that you aren't sure about.  Give yourself outs.
1506970049847959560 2022-03-24 12:23:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nerita_ll Definitely. Run away fast.
1506969995682717700 2022-03-24 12:23:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Definitely some important stuff, Dhruv.
1506969126031564807 2022-03-24 12:20:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Advice I wish I had 2 years ago:  • Focus on the 20% that matters • Generating attention is most important • Outsource/automate administrative tasks • Before building anything, consider optionality • Block and ignore anyone who doesn't deserve you  Hope that helps.
1506959665023889419 2022-03-24 11:42:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FindTroy Thank you, my man. 🙌
1506781582903943171 2022-03-23 23:54:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Imene_Maharzi Hell yeah. LFG
1506781468898607105 2022-03-23 23:54:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Thank you my man!
1506689883607388164 2022-03-23 17:50:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theorencohen Awesome. Don't give away all of the secret sauce ;-)
1506688576410595331 2022-03-23 17:45:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matt_gray_ @CoreyWilksPsyD Hell yeah. Chat soon!
1506683871353581568 2022-03-23 17:26:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD LFG.
1506667737472552964 2022-03-23 16:22:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamesklicked Appreciate that so much 🚀
1506667737472450572 2022-03-23 16:22:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @muskmarketeer Thank you!
1506667732669980673 2022-03-23 16:22:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scribblykaur I like to think so. It's so nice to hear it from folks, though.
1506667677795946496 2022-03-23 16:22:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kk_komal Thank you, Komal!
1506667645587836928 2022-03-23 16:22:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steve_P_Brady 100% Steve
1506667605431566344 2022-03-23 16:22:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Growth_Corner The flywheel can be MASSIVE
1506667551299932168 2022-03-23 16:21:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JasonHershman hello@justinwelsh.me   You'll get an auto-responder, but I'll receive it.
1506667473013194755 2022-03-23 16:21:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Hell yeah. That's what I like to hear, Dave.
1506667430134927360 2022-03-23 16:21:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Thank you so much, man!
1506667402913886216 2022-03-23 16:21:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @podfixer101 Thanks, David. You definitely will, man. It's a game that requires a ton of work.
1506662618152505348 2022-03-23 16:02:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I have 4,755 online course students.   At least once per day, one of them says something good about my product.  That's a helluva marketing channel.
1506647759214059535 2022-03-23 15:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shusmo Thank you, my man!
1506641502247784453 2022-03-23 14:38:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush I've seen people overcomplicate things for 5+ years, then simplify and actually see their first results. Start simple, you can always add complexity later.
1506639927877980167 2022-03-23 14:32:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @milenaregos Thank you, Milena. I'm so glad you liked it!
1506620593755545605 2022-03-23 13:15:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanisRenaud Haha. Nah.  Once you have interested people, you need to help people understand that there is a solution to their problem.  Once they believe that, the last step is sharing why YOUR solution is the best one.  A: Awareness I: Interest D: Decision A: Action
1506618105002434560 2022-03-23 13:05:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanisRenaud Basically, it's on you to highlight the problem in all of the content you create, and all of the marketing you produce.  Then you need to capture people interested in learning more and start to create interest in solving the problem.
1506613927383347202 2022-03-23 12:48:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanisRenaud Sounds like you need awareness marketing.  Awareness marketing is intended to make people aware of a problem they don't know exists.  You can't solve a problem that someone doesn't even know they have.
1506610615053398020 2022-03-23 12:35:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @funnelcopies Exactly. Noise and attention is key. Honing in on the signals becomes the differentiator though.
1506610515191214090 2022-03-23 12:35:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @legend_lumie You don't need a book. Go get started.
1506610137422774280 2022-03-23 12:33:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @juleslancee @WebinarOS  https://t.co/IJVfpewYMz
1506609712573337605 2022-03-23 12:32:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CeoJeremiah Love it, Jeremiah.
1506609667442626560 2022-03-23 12:31:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Garrath_R Correct. Hone in on what's working.
1506609178202230791 2022-03-23 12:29:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @castle_bridges Alrighty.
1506609112502751238 2022-03-23 12:29:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito Sure. Look back at my Twitter account or read my LinkedIn profile.  I've written every morning on LinkedIn for 3 years and every day 2x (usually) on Twitter for almost 5 months.
1506608934278291462 2022-03-23 12:28:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Yep.
1506608905647964163 2022-03-23 12:28:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @juleslancee @WebinarOS Cool! Don't forget to create a lot of attention first.
1506608835192102921 2022-03-23 12:28:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @legend_lumie You need a system for producing results:  - journal - ask yourself what you learned - think about what you needed to know 2 years ago - Ask family and friends what you're good at
1506608670523731977 2022-03-23 12:27:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rajasimon Write on the internet. All introverts can do this.
1506608119094329348 2022-03-23 12:25:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd Because building products and services seems like "business" when what they really need is marketing.
1506608002417180678 2022-03-23 12:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NinaGreimel 100%. Achievable and likely if you put in the consistent work.
1506607922402504710 2022-03-23 12:24:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Brett_Trainor Focused = one building block at a time
1506607645351985159 2022-03-23 12:23:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OfferMafia Then, hone in on what's working.
1506607613026385930 2022-03-23 12:23:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ModestMitkus I see you :)
1506607144023597063 2022-03-23 12:21:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship has never been easier:  - Create lots of noise - Analyze to find signal - 2x what's working well - Create a service offering - Get it very systematized - Productize in a course - Raise service rate  None of this is possible without some noise.  Create some today.

1506257813210869774 2022-03-22 13:13:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kristofferryeng @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi One is for maximizing LinkedIn, the other is for rapidly producing high-quality written content for any platform.
1506257301354786817 2022-03-22 13:11:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Howardmann I break it down specifically inside of the course.
1506255355017318406 2022-03-22 13:03:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarrisFanaroff It's at the end of the thread, but here ya go:   https://t.co/zSnmbhgkNY

1506252745489137667 2022-03-22 12:53:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Just systems-based. That's all!
1506249295279890435 2022-03-22 12:39:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @josherau @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi @SaveToNotion Appreciate it!
1506249235817287680 2022-03-22 12:39:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls Many thanks, Shaun. 🙌

1506248111500533773 2022-03-22 12:35:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vvilltaylor Appreciate you, Will!
1506248076855496710 2022-03-22 12:35:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KurtisHanni I'd do it the same. Low-cost products built on what I learned selling my coaching/advising service.
1506247966130069508 2022-03-22 12:34:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandDifferentl Heck yeah. See you inside. Can't wait to hear your feedback.
1506247901256761344 2022-03-22 12:34:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coach_avinash Thank you so much, Avinash.
1506247160106557441 2022-03-22 12:31:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Love hearing it man.
1506247118066966536 2022-03-22 12:31:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyandcheese Thank you, my man 🙌
1506246384307036173 2022-03-22 12:28:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliTheCFO I don't simply because I don't love to be on video.
1506246297526935554 2022-03-22 12:27:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SPAT_77 I work a normal 9-5 like anyone. I just do it on my own terms.
1506246227880460297 2022-03-22 12:27:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks Nice, man. This is awesome.
1506246151917428736 2022-03-22 12:27:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandDifferentl It is a course.   https://t.co/zSnmbhgkNY
1506245687217987585 2022-03-22 12:25:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Oh hell yeah. Thanks, man.

1506244671923798017 2022-03-22 12:21:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandDifferentl I break it down inside of the Content OS
1506244129038249988 2022-03-22 12:19:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me @JustinSaaS for more of these 2. RT the tweet below to share this thread with your audience
1506244126660083713 2022-03-22 12:19:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi None of these systems matter if you can't get discovered.  So, I took my 4-part Twitter &amp; LinkedIn Content Operating System and turned it into a product.  I just released it this morning.   If you're interested in getting it for 20% off, head here:   https://t.co/6qifnNJ3Sg
1506244124814495747 2022-03-22 12:19:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi 9/ Coaching  Two weeks after completing my course, students receive an email positioning my coaching services.  Candidly, I don't want to do more coaching.  But it's where I discover the most ideas for new products.  Coach &gt; idea &gt; product &gt; repeat
1506244122927157252 2022-03-22 12:19:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi 8/ Affiliates  When you complete the course, I position my affiliate program.  It's all automated with video and email prompts, plus self-onboarding.  When new affiliates enter the program, they receive instant templates by email that they can use to sell via social or email.
1506244121115119623 2022-03-22 12:19:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi 7/ Upsells  I position upsells at the front end of the purchase flow.  But I also send automated emails when lessons are completed.  They position relevant recurring revenue products.  Finish a section on templates?   You're getting pitched in your inbox a few minutes later.
1506244086268891137 2022-03-22 12:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta @Kajabi 6/ Testimonials  I use a short 55-second video to ask people for testimonials.  Rather than have them email me, I embed  https://t.co/DNeY0WF8u7 into the module.  When they click it, their camera opens up and they can record right away.  These get auto-added to my landing page.
1506244084452712449 2022-03-22 12:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury @typeshare_co @outseta 5/ Digital products  All of my creator products are hosted on @Kajabi  Students can purchase and watch any time of the day or night.  As they get deeper in, I use email automation to inspire them to continue.  When they hit the 50% mark, more automation kicks in like...
1506244082414374922 2022-03-22 12:19:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury @typeshare_co 4/ Private community  Communities deepen relationships.  I run one with 600 solopreneurs from 55 countries.  I built a very complex application, acceptance, onboarding, and churn process using @outseta  You can read more about that here:  https://t.co/EAvITZI64v
1506244080229101577 2022-03-22 12:19:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury 3/ Newsletter writing  Newsletters build trust in the Creator Funnel.  But, they are usually time-consuming.  To write mine in less than 30 minutes, I use @typeshare_co  Built by modern digital writers, it provides the templates I need to work quickly and with high quality.
1506244077880324098 2022-03-22 12:19:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ LinkedIn content  If you're creating for Twitter &amp; skipping LinkedIn, you're missing out.  My first 7-figures came entirely on that platform.  I use @Hypefury to cross-schedule everything from Twitter to LinkedIn.  Plus, I can make minor adjustments to be platform-relevant.
1506244075757973506 2022-03-22 12:19:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Twitter content  Generating revenue as a creator starts with being discovered.  I have a 4-part Operating System for:  - Curation - Templatizing - Rapid creation - Distribution &amp; growth  This allows me to create 15-30 pieces an hour.
1506244066882768900 2022-03-22 12:19:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Today, I'll cross $2M in income in 2.5 years as a creator.  All 6 revenue streams are managed using systems.  Here are my 9 "must-have" systems for creators.  [🧵 thread}

1506002450553126921 2022-03-21 20:18:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iammosesaboh Put shitty content into a template and nothing happens. It's more than templates.
1505998972770521094 2022-03-21 20:05:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanLinner @mattheytens Zero ads. I've never run one.
1505971572951207936 2022-03-21 18:16:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_nathanrene Alright.
1505971416696504323 2022-03-21 18:15:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamsimm0 Great thread. Appreciate the shout!
1505970418183720965 2022-03-21 18:11:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Thanks. Should I coin it?
1505970413293166599 2022-03-21 18:11:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @muskmarketeer Thank you!
1505969956822917120 2022-03-21 18:09:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Exactly. Creating is my job. And like any good business, it requires systems.   Willpower eventually falters at some point.
1505969713670729728 2022-03-21 18:08:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @writetoon Love hearing this. Thanks so much!

1505957396136534032 2022-03-21 17:19:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh Once you have them in place...woah. Scale.
1505957366721925120 2022-03-21 17:19:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BarbaraFleury It truly is, Barbara.
1505957334442467335 2022-03-21 17:19:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WillCoombe @JamesClear That quote is in my systems course :).
1505957258294927370 2022-03-21 17:19:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD Certainly part of systems, yes. (At least, my systems)
1505957200719757318 2022-03-21 17:19:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TJCBerman I have a whole content creation system built out using 4-different pieces. Let's me create 20 pieces per day.
1505957071916838924 2022-03-21 17:18:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena Same!
1505957046172241922 2022-03-21 17:18:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MrJacobEspi Same. Once I understood them, it was game over.
1505956990517977093 2022-03-21 17:18:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mr_otg Correct. And creativity.
1505956954346336260 2022-03-21 17:18:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steve_P_Brady Yep. Do the work. Learn. Systematize.
1505956911954415618 2022-03-21 17:18:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VladPasca5 Same here, Vlad.
1505956879171833861 2022-03-21 17:17:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Yep. And keeps you producing on "down" days.

1505953155405815808 2022-03-21 17:03:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Content creation is 10% creativity, 20% work ethic, and 70% systems.
1505907111062036488 2022-03-21 14:00:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattheytens This is such a great thread, Matt. Thanks!  I knew the original thread I wrote had more value in it, and I was determined to have more people see it.
1505890926706806787 2022-03-21 12:55:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aurasky_ @dvassallo He's the man that started all of this for me.
1505886992063770626 2022-03-21 12:40:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Nailed it, Dennis.
1505886958622543873 2022-03-21 12:40:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @girdley Oh, wow. I love this, Michael. Thanks for sharing it.
1505886879392096259 2022-03-21 12:39:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliTheCFO Certainly. It's best when a few work!
1505885788709474308 2022-03-21 12:35:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tysjohnson Correct. Chain 'em all together.
1505885177939173376 2022-03-21 12:32:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii I love that, Dave.
1505885127422922758 2022-03-21 12:32:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ashish4sharma Systems.
1505885111144828931 2022-03-21 12:32:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheKushagra25 I sure hope so.
1505885058653208576 2022-03-21 12:32:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @girdley Thanks, Michael! Is this how you operate currently?
1505884966370091013 2022-03-21 12:32:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dikshayaar Correct. Too many people do.
1505884929044926465 2022-03-21 12:31:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @igorbenic Yep. You can always double down on the biggest.
1505884859289546759 2022-03-21 12:31:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP 100%. Don't go "all in". Build multiple opportunities.
1505883465539018756 2022-03-21 12:26:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Treat your career like a VC.  Build a portfolio of revenue streams, knowing one will hit big.  The diversified entrepreneur.
1505670057644507139 2022-03-20 22:18:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BetterCeo I'm not changing the definition.   I'm advocating that we stop telling people what they can and cannot become.
1505649254420951041 2022-03-20 20:55:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejosephmurray Lol.
1505646281112395785 2022-03-20 20:43:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Exactly. Start something small. Chip away.   Build it up past your current role and then turn it into a full time gig.
1505611811369984005 2022-03-20 18:26:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MrJacobEspi Oh same!
1505611746584809478 2022-03-20 18:26:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Saasterix That's 100% true.
1505611705015054342 2022-03-20 18:26:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zurieljeffre Thanks Zuriel
1505611665647226882 2022-03-20 18:26:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevLinguistic You're welcome!
1505611639277633543 2022-03-20 18:26:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD Correct.
1505611612870397952 2022-03-20 18:25:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KarlLHughes 100% it does, but I'm not sure entrepreneurship requires you to quit your job and stop getting paid. Plenty of entrepreneurs started with side hustles.  I agree not everyone will succeed, but who am I to keep people from trying?
1505611435254104066 2022-03-20 18:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD 100% agreed, Tom.
1505611401800396800 2022-03-20 18:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hellokellybrito Entrepreneurship is a lot of things. I just hate when other people project their doubts onto others.  I've been told plenty of times it "isn't for you". If I had listened...damn.
1505604105636651008 2022-03-20 17:56:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> "Not everyone is an entrepreneur" is silly.  We're all born to create and that's the spirit of entrepreneurship.  So go out there &amp; build your thing.  Don't let a bunch of babysitters project their lack of self-confidence onto you.
1505549351678095361 2022-03-20 14:18:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brennan_decker Thank you so much for being a customer, Brennan. Glad you enjoyed it!
1505538092559740938 2022-03-20 13:33:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lochhead @theclearhead @natolisnuggets Of course. Sorry if my original Tweet came off as aggressive. That wasn't my intention, I just wasn't paying much attention. Good back and forth!
1505536213125640193 2022-03-20 13:26:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lochhead @theclearhead @natolisnuggets "Play Bigger" Looks awesome.
1505535453738450945 2022-03-20 13:23:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theclearhead @lochhead @natolisnuggets I just bought this to see what all of the fuss is about.
1505534439853543431 2022-03-20 13:19:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd I 100% agree with this, Ernesto. Great point here.

1505534150329217025 2022-03-20 13:18:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush The easiest way to start writing well is to unlearn everything first.  Then start filling your brain with education from the new wave of digital writers.   Like you.

1505528113895284737 2022-03-20 12:54:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chelyn_briand Too many people moving way too fast.
1505526298860560384 2022-03-20 12:46:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dikshayaar Exactly. Build a service business first.  Learn exactly how to solve a common problem.   Turn that into a product.
1505526058656976899 2022-03-20 12:45:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @muskmarketeer Yep, but especially those relying on only themselves.
1505526008128184326 2022-03-20 12:45:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WillCoombe One of my favorite quotes.
1505525521572114434 2022-03-20 12:43:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewmcbarnett Sure - a different platform, different audience, different discord, etc.  It's a whole new game.
1505525148824350721 2022-03-20 12:42:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamie_dru I recently spoke to someone building a product.  I asked him to describe it. He did.  I asked him if his audience would use that language to describe their biggest problems. They would not.  Ouch.
1505524593787867141 2022-03-20 12:40:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylegawley @arvidkahl I feel like Arvid has cool sayings for everything 😂
1505524373150736387 2022-03-20 12:39:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom @sweatystartup Do interesting things and attract interesting people.
1505523971051208704 2022-03-20 12:37:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Advice every solopreneur should hear:  • Spend years giving free knowledge • Don't sell, just listen for problems • Learn to solve the problems • Build a service business • Then productize  Far too many people sell before they understand their audience.  Play the long game.
1505510418785226753 2022-03-20 11:43:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMKhateeb @lochhead I agree with Christopher here as well.  I should have been more clear on my original Tweet. Your journey must ultimately be about them.  I'm not advocating for a me-first approach, but rather a you-first approach through the journey together.
1505333445500805125 2022-03-20 00:00:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lochhead Easy to say with confidence.  Prove it.
1505299339576553475 2022-03-19 21:45:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamVazquez That sounds awesome. 🙌🏻
1505214666577960963 2022-03-19 16:08:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheFalanBlake 100%. It’s a club building together.
1505214345835384837 2022-03-19 16:07:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheQCGhost Probably pretty close to the truth in the solopreneur world.
1505213274975088649 2022-03-19 16:03:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The best marketing for solopreneurs is bringing people on your journey.   If you're doing interesting things offline and not sharing them online, you're losing customers.

1504848928583438341 2022-03-18 15:55:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amandamoore1012 @HawkenSchool This is where I'm from in Ohio. Love Hawken.
1504843024932777985 2022-03-18 15:31:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @warikoo Yet everyone is here on Twitter trying to learn them in less than 280 characters.  Pretty wild, ya know? :)
1504805866956013570 2022-03-18 13:04:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Great question. I wrote a thread that I thought was killer information and very few people read it.  So I just rewrote the hook and it became this:   https://t.co/NxMdQiFKch
1504803984703430670 2022-03-18 12:56:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Basically, if it does well (subjective) I repurpose it 4-5 months later.
1504802847690571781 2022-03-18 12:52:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Exactly. I can't remember almost anything people wrote.
1504802681805754379 2022-03-18 12:51:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls Yep. Learn to say 1 thing 1,000 different ways and you'll be in good shape.
1504802596174938117 2022-03-18 12:51:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Sometimes. Other times it doesn't need any editing, IMO.
1504802486070263809 2022-03-18 12:50:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @diegoquendoo This is exactly how I think about it, Diego.
1504802398572888066 2022-03-18 12:50:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kimwillishere Or just repurpose in a similar format. People never remember.
1504798843166199810 2022-03-18 12:36:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks Exactly. Those data points are super key.
1504798794382254083 2022-03-18 12:36:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevLinguistic A little bit of both is what I do. Some content is best left untouched.
1504798731119566858 2022-03-18 12:35:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Exactly. Edit what worked until it's even more powerful.
1504798674962071553 2022-03-18 12:35:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti I wait about 4-5 months.
1504798646239436818 2022-03-18 12:35:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Art0fLife_ @victor_bigfield I usually do 4-5 but there's probably no "right" answer.
1504798585191378945 2022-03-18 12:35:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Love that, Dave.
1504798558523994114 2022-03-18 12:35:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach It's amazing when you find out that they do. Or that they missed it in the first place.
1504798475900309507 2022-03-18 12:34:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @podfixer101 That it does. My best content is often a year old or more.
1504798430295695372 2022-03-18 12:34:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @instastrategist Learn to say 1 thing 1,000 different ways.
1504798365250469890 2022-03-18 12:34:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SPAT_77 Definitely. Keep teaching others.
1504798287609610240 2022-03-18 12:34:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JarvisKa Exactly. If it resonated, make sure more people see it.
1504798228302151685 2022-03-18 12:33:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack It sure does, Imrane.
1504798204663115778 2022-03-18 12:33:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tgs0376 Glad it was helpful, Tom!
1504798174388666368 2022-03-18 12:33:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlastairDigby Love that.
1504796058752364548 2022-03-18 12:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're publishing content daily, remember:  - 75% of your followers didn't see it - 80% of your followers won't remember - 100% of your new followers never saw it  Repurpose often.  Nobody remembers your content like you remember your content.

1504613825261314053 2022-03-18 00:21:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jose_edil The best start would just be to teach kids that it's an option.  Then potentially some basics around market, problem solving, testing solutions, etc.  Real light. But expose them to the thought process behind it. I think it would do wonders even for kids who will never be one.
1504611139099017216 2022-03-18 00:10:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrislouvion I'd argue most teachers are better entrepreneurs than the people who put "entrepreneur" in their Twitter bio because they once helped a friend for free 🤷‍♂️
1504610502177169410 2022-03-18 00:07:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jose_edil Who cares? That's not a reason to decide that we won't introduce the basics.  None of my teachers were world-renowned mathematicians but they gave me the basics of math.
1504609986558808064 2022-03-18 00:05:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @busbybrian1 @BradSpencer Wait...I'm just asking a question out loud here. How did I earn that response?
1504609726662946817 2022-03-18 00:04:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CPASuperHero @fiverr Math, history, and science aren't "one thing" either.  I'm talking the basics
1504609378443448323 2022-03-18 00:03:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tribute392 @techladyallison We teach Math in schools and we don't have a world full of Mathematicians.
1504594458628743168 2022-03-17 23:04:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BradSpencer That's what I'm thinking. It doesn't need to be overly complex.  Just the basics.
1504594352819036161 2022-03-17 23:03:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daytonmills Best answer.
1504594180202504204 2022-03-17 23:03:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bewellwithnikki Yeah, that is dope and I meant the concept. Exactly.  Just plant the seeds, ya know?
1504594056474673164 2022-03-17 23:02:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheWritingGuru That's awesome. I just feel like there is some way to mold these behaviors earlier.   I'd love to see more people say what you say. Ya know?
1504593692685967371 2022-03-17 23:01:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BradSpencer Sure, but we teach it in college. Why is it so crazy to assume we could go down a level?
1504593560947113987 2022-03-17 23:00:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Hi_AndrewWilson That's awesome to hear!
1504593478998794246 2022-03-17 23:00:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @geoff_l I know lots of entrepreneurs that head down to Stanford, Booth, Wharton, etc. and teach regularly.
1504587172183261191 2022-03-17 22:35:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmontu33 @MySuccessTheory Right, but that’s a cop out. Just because you can’t learn everything about entrepreneurship in a classroom doesn’t mean we shouldn’t expose people to the ideas.
1504586932231315456 2022-03-17 22:34:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mgsdisha It’s weird that all of Twitter says, “You can’t learn entrepreneurship in school” but proceeds to spend hours per day trying to learn it in less than 280 characters.
1504586584884191238 2022-03-17 22:32:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daltonkjensen The same way it’s taught in colleges and universities across the world but at a more basic level.
1504586455418560521 2022-03-17 22:32:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @guerrist I’m surprised by some of what people are saying. Sure entrepreneurship is learned by doing (edgy comments!) but why not expose people to the thought process earlier?
1504586199180132353 2022-03-17 22:31:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @techladyallison I think this is the answer.
1504586110030262279 2022-03-17 22:30:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @garydarna That’s probably a good reason why.
1504586054262788106 2022-03-17 22:30:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewamann That’s not true at all. It’s taught in tons of colleges. Why not expose kids earlier?
1504585826084212739 2022-03-17 22:29:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 Right but that doesn’t mean we can’t include it in the curriculum.
1504585720454860801 2022-03-17 22:29:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks Sure but colleges like Stanford teach it. Why not just expose kids to the concepts earlier?
1504579858877276164 2022-03-17 22:06:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Why don't more high schools teach entrepreneurship?
1504494852586807299 2022-03-17 16:28:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NYR_Blueshirt Maybe. Great idea.
1504493188291125251 2022-03-17 16:21:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davemcg3 Yep. I use this framework:  https://t.co/6IZTcuY0nW  I just expand the site as I get questions/feedback.
1504492385841172486 2022-03-17 16:18:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks So much so. I love working out and thinking.
1504492346485923852 2022-03-17 16:18:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @podfixer101 Same.
1504492324050681859 2022-03-17 16:18:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheFrederique Yep. Shower I get panicked because I have a good idea and no pen 😂
1504492169658347522 2022-03-17 16:17:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMoney_Wizard Haha. Sorry man.
1504492120215805961 2022-03-17 16:17:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Sajal_O I do.
1504492096199311369 2022-03-17 16:17:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxcrafter I'd listen to that.
1504492060031733768 2022-03-17 16:17:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @touseefcodes Try with a friend or a dog :)
1504492026968121359 2022-03-17 16:17:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Automated_Rev Sounds like I'm in pretty good company then.
1504491991358488585 2022-03-17 16:16:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thejosephmurray Thanks, James!
1504491946546536449 2022-03-17 16:16:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexcoderTX Looks like our park here and we also have a crane. Weird!
1504491780053639179 2022-03-17 16:16:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JasonSpears It just might be.
1504489986963484673 2022-03-17 16:08:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JasonHershman Agreed!
1504489957817159685 2022-03-17 16:08:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexcoderTX Is this Shelby Bottoms park in Nashville?
1504489370467905540 2022-03-17 16:06:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MiaKiraki Love it, Mia. 🔥
1504489333016903683 2022-03-17 16:06:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adamkreek I love that. If I had a better back I might try it!
1504489262044962816 2022-03-17 16:06:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RikNieu I've been writing about it for years and the responses to my writing have provided enough validation to at least presell.
1504488257031049221 2022-03-17 16:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Brainstormed a new product during a 6-mile walk with my wife today.  - Domain purchased - MVP site in progress - Launching in 12 days  Taking walks is a business cheat code.
1504483365386276865 2022-03-17 15:42:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyandcheese No. And I will never sell you crypto. It’s an impostor and a scam.
1504482668909453313 2022-03-17 15:39:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomfallowfield @sangeet_kar @arvidkahl @MeetKevon @brennandunn @david_perell @hellofailory @AlexLlullTW @peeplaja Thank you, Tom!
1504466193096351745 2022-03-17 14:34:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson Sure thing.  I have a system for producing content quickly and efficiently.  I have a system for automating my community onboarding.  Just 2 examples.
1504444626723295236 2022-03-17 13:08:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Love the "read out loud" part.  I do this for every newsletter and I catch "tough to understand" parts right away.  Great advice, Dickie.
1504444331414986760 2022-03-17 13:07:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak This is the attitude.  When a friend releases a product, I buy it nearly every time.  Let's support each other out here for crying out loud.
1504438968993079299 2022-03-17 12:46:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @McLovin_Murat One of my favorite sayings.
1504438934364905482 2022-03-17 12:46:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CarolLRead Same here, Carol!
1504438880145137673 2022-03-17 12:45:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dklineii Same here. Time audit for friction.
1504438842547449860 2022-03-17 12:45:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ScottWRobinson Yep. Give it to a random person at Sbux and pay 'em.
1504438766123253764 2022-03-17 12:45:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen For sure. Eliminate, automate, delegate, systematize.
1504435671640989704 2022-03-17 12:33:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach Thank you so much. I appreciate that.   Trying to only post helpful stuff.
1504434987105411077 2022-03-17 12:30:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Yep. Get the systems in place as early as possible and as you scale, you can grow on top of them.
1504434878603005955 2022-03-17 12:30:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Same here.
1504434823666057223 2022-03-17 12:29:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aurasky_ Very far.
1504434793542524928 2022-03-17 12:29:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach I'm going to be releasing something really soon that dives super deep into how I systematize everything.
1504434695550947330 2022-03-17 12:29:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv I love it, Dhruv.
1504434647693942787 2022-03-17 12:29:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markospri Yep. And with systems, you have to think less and less to get things accomplished.
1504434550881067012 2022-03-17 12:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliQOfficial Anything that can't be eliminated or automated should be systematized to the extent it can be.
1504434484736843782 2022-03-17 12:28:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonFluharty Love that comment, Brandon. I know you're a systems guy.
1504434421549735937 2022-03-17 12:28:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav 🔥
1504434328725565444 2022-03-17 12:27:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NikolausPatel Love this, Nikolaus. Did you create it?
1504432406371180545 2022-03-17 12:20:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurs can't rely on work ethic.  Instead:  - Eliminate what you can - Automate as much as possible - Build out systems for leftover work - Execute your systems every single day  Motivation eventually falters.  Systems rarely do.
1504246163578540041 2022-03-17 00:00:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush @dickiebuch I've had literally, no joke, over 30 impostors in the last 12 weeks.   It's getting ridiculous.
1504243513894047744 2022-03-16 23:49:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ It's definitely a big part of the growth, and probably the most challenging piece to stay committed to.   I missed this week!
1504163394198425614 2022-03-16 18:31:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Pikachu8084 Sounds good. LMK when you come over.
1504163364234272772 2022-03-16 18:31:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @farzalistudios Thanks!
1504163258021859334 2022-03-16 18:30:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyforcreators Well, thanks!
1504163190074138626 2022-03-16 18:30:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina It really can be. Most good things usually are, ya know?
1504163068733005826 2022-03-16 18:29:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tgs0376 No strict definition. Just people with a lot of followers in a similar space to me
1504162980660973572 2022-03-16 18:29:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CharlesWeill I would just spend a ton of time on @harrydry's website called  https://t.co/ZVbx6xdGPr
1504147842163953665 2022-03-16 17:29:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays I figured this would be up your alley.
1504128773142495232 2022-03-16 16:13:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachMacUK Yes, definitely. It just requires zooming out and remembering that not everyone is focused on the same things with the same commitment.
1504128534566129665 2022-03-16 16:12:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LazerFocus_ I just don't interact with my published content when I go on vacation. Or I carve our 45 minutes and interact.  My courses sell on their own, I don't need to show up.
1504127472773836805 2022-03-16 16:08:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cesartastic Same here. Will always be a WIP
1504127431711641607 2022-03-16 16:08:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister It's critical today...
1504127400501731335 2022-03-16 16:08:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @storymentor Yep. And you must be able to turn attention into income.
1504126010983391237 2022-03-16 16:02:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joe_portsmouth Thank you so much for the kind mention here, Joe. Much appreciated. 🔥
1504125865050923016 2022-03-16 16:02:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Great solopreneurs are often highly knowledgeable people who understand copywriting.

1504113905865527301 2022-03-16 15:14:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DylanReidTweets Just chat in the comments or DM when appropriate.
1504094951617056774 2022-03-16 13:59:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl @paritydeals @SachinNeravath Yes! Been looking for something like this. Perfect timing.
1504088514094411782 2022-03-16 13:33:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattheytens @Twitter I've been impersonated more than 30 times in one month. It's exhausting.
1504088385157312516 2022-03-16 13:33:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDylanCulbert I never have. I just don't like gimmicks. I write like I talk and I don't talk with hashtags.
1504085606791618560 2022-03-16 13:22:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danthewolfe @ShaunEls I don't DM people with threads. I find that awkward. I just hope the value of the thread stands on it's own.
1504076092654723073 2022-03-16 12:44:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RichardWBown It's all about consistency, having a plan, and learning to write well.
1504075984613617668 2022-03-16 12:43:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @speedmindset It's certainly more wide open. Go grab it, and if you don't like it, I'll refund you 110%.
1504075868850827264 2022-03-16 12:43:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Alkaabycrypto I don't speak with hashtags, so I don't write with them.
1504075815646109700 2022-03-16 12:43:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhikalanz Get some sleep :)
1504075761183076363 2022-03-16 12:43:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @junwu_noon If it's helpful.
1504074506322821123 2022-03-16 12:38:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @janahan888 Appreciate that, Janahan!
1504074467869401091 2022-03-16 12:37:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Most good things are pretty simply executed.
1504073889856598022 2022-03-16 12:35:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aminepreneur You are welcome. Thanks for reading.
1504073838954532864 2022-03-16 12:35:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nikitalall7 Perfect. Glad you enjoyed it.
1504073793249038337 2022-03-16 12:35:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @premiumtools_ke Thank you.
1504073767806459904 2022-03-16 12:35:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JasonHershman Great! So glad it's helpful.
1504073714870243332 2022-03-16 12:34:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls I think lots of people complain while threads continue to do extremely well.  I don't listen to complainers. I listen to the market.
1504072384411750401 2022-03-16 12:29:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyandcheese It's been a fun journey for sure, Ricardo.
1504072336106000386 2022-03-16 12:29:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marklebrunn Sure thing, Mark!
1504072310810107904 2022-03-16 12:29:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chelyn_briand Twitter is a bit more difficult, but you accelerate much faster if you figure it out.
1504072216970936326 2022-03-16 12:28:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks A combo of both, to be honest. Sometimes, I just comment. Other times, I find something to take to DM.
1504071381096534018 2022-03-16 12:25:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ergestx Not if you build out systems to make it easier.
1504070783085293568 2022-03-16 12:23:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I’ve Tweeted 157 days in a row.  And added 49k+ followers.  Here are 4 simple lessons learned:  1. Share one useful tip each morning. 2. Comment under large accounts. 3. Engage with 5 people daily. 4. Write 1 thread per week.  That's it.  Hope that's helpful.
1503803898192084995 2022-03-15 18:42:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SchusterDev That earns a follow 😀
1503803043892051969 2022-03-15 18:39:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SchusterDev Mind reporting him?
1503801863442948097 2022-03-15 18:34:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_SchusterDev It's an impostor. Sorry, my friend.
1503801772896366601 2022-03-15 18:34:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mahmoodb I make mine affordable, but not free.  There's no right answer for tech.

1503775704248426504 2022-03-15 16:50:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joannawills_ This is such a great comment, Joanna. I've been there too.
1503775567652569097 2022-03-15 16:50:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare 100%. Those looking for "easy" are looking for the wrong thing.
1503775503148322817 2022-03-15 16:49:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv That you can grow with.
1503775469677785088 2022-03-15 16:49:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt Exactly. Everything is hard, so might as well make it something worthwhile.
1503775371707260931 2022-03-15 16:49:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @natolisnuggets Yup.
1503775347392790535 2022-03-15 16:49:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aurasky_ Exactly. Should I write or record video?  Whichever one you'll stick with.
1503775268074307591 2022-03-15 16:48:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @instastrategist For sure. Might as well go for upside.
1503775233416826882 2022-03-15 16:48:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomberryCD Boom.
1503774041928310787 2022-03-15 16:44:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every job is hard.  Pick the "hard" with the big upside.
1503747448518422544 2022-03-15 14:58:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikefutia Haha. Moral of the story?   There's no "right" way. Congrats on the massive number! :)   I did mine through LinkedIn 👀
1503747021961928718 2022-03-15 14:56:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikefutia I'm about to cross $700k in course sales almost none of it comes from email. All social.
1503746877174562823 2022-03-15 14:56:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adammarx13 @BootstrapBro @austinbelcak  https://t.co/p91ONzb3mb
1503735016647450625 2022-03-15 14:09:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BootstrapBro @adammarx13 @austinbelcak That's how I started.
1503717543709708293 2022-03-15 12:59:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arshadiswriting I love that about it.
1503717493780758534 2022-03-15 12:59:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @igorbenic 100%, Igor.
1503717462507933703 2022-03-15 12:59:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @si_abang_tim @austinbelcak Absolutely, Austin. I can't code, and I still built this business on my own without hiring developers or anything.
1503713619179192323 2022-03-15 12:43:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Bunbeau1 Agreed. I just think that mix will shift over time.
1503713615144177671 2022-03-15 12:43:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tgs0376 It's a game-changer for sure, Tom.
1503711699941138432 2022-03-15 12:36:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAM10Mindset 100%.
1503711649450151937 2022-03-15 12:36:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Bunbeau1 Totally. But the old will fade over time as technology works to keep things out of our feeds and inboxes.
1503711539567673351 2022-03-15 12:35:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aurasky_ Right. You need a skill and to identify who can benefit from your teaching.
1503711428993339397 2022-03-15 12:35:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls Definitely. I like it too.
1503711393987629071 2022-03-15 12:35:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jlogic Having a community is part of the relationship-building process today. Very helpful.
1503711318414708741 2022-03-15 12:34:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lordklukpui Yes. Just presell and validate with simple tools.
1503711264492638212 2022-03-15 12:34:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adammarx13 @austinbelcak Fancy websites are a time suck. Start simple with something like Carrd and once you've proven you can make money online, then maybe move.

1503708429566844938 2022-03-15 12:23:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Crazy talk.
1503708357634531332 2022-03-15 12:23:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevLinguistic It's a lot more personal and connected.
1503708328853131277 2022-03-15 12:22:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare 100%, Keyur. It happens faster than ya think.

1503423727987535879 2022-03-14 17:32:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @junwu_noon 100%.
1503423686237380608 2022-03-14 17:31:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vvilltaylor Great list, Will. 🔥
1503423610538672128 2022-03-14 17:31:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @1amitarora Barrier to entry has never been lower.
1503423558248284160 2022-03-14 17:31:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lordklukpui That's the ticket right there, Lord.
1503416440187232264 2022-03-14 17:03:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you can influence people online, you have a head start on entrepreneurship.
1503364763274862594 2022-03-14 13:37:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheFalanBlake It was sent on Twitter.
1503361715949510658 2022-03-14 13:25:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fredtheinvestor If I hadn't already quit my job, this might have done it.
1503361644193357833 2022-03-14 13:25:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PropertyHelp4U Is it though?
1503361613994381312 2022-03-14 13:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @web3paloma My newest GTM strategy.
1503361577042558984 2022-03-14 13:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrivingCS Seems legit though.
1503361552191148032 2022-03-14 13:24:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @weirdlyy_funnyy Caught me off guard a bit too.
1503361513108783104 2022-03-14 13:24:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shivi_jalota It's stone cold.
1503361487783743491 2022-03-14 13:24:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt Obviously not.
1503359502971777025 2022-03-14 13:16:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyJimBurgess My new CTA.
1503359461938839556 2022-03-14 13:16:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 Definitely. Let your audience (and the data) guide you.
1503359311484964868 2022-03-14 13:16:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JackSaaS Start paying!
1503358107384270850 2022-03-14 13:11:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wtravishubbard Lol. And a car.
1503358060315746311 2022-03-14 13:11:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_alexbrogan You just gotta have the right strategy.
1503357888869412869 2022-03-14 13:10:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SebDugudae Aggressive.
1503357863787438081 2022-03-14 13:10:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikepsecuritee This made me laugh hard.
1503357786339557380 2022-03-14 13:10:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @serenaded_ The ol' "Gimme some money" trick.
1503357741632532480 2022-03-14 13:09:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMBA_coach I might try it. Bold.
1503356993326747648 2022-03-14 13:06:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to make $1,000 per day on the internet.  Few people understand this.  https://t.co/g6NXfpN789
1503356339065659396 2022-03-14 13:04:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach I just listen to my audience and look at the data. Quantitative + qualitative feedback.
1503350403706064903 2022-03-14 12:40:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyJimBurgess @DevLinguistic Thanks so much, Jim! Keep going...you're never really "finished".
1503350248437080067 2022-03-14 12:40:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KushShah9492 Definitely. Create for a year and it will likely find you.
1503347894744764420 2022-03-14 12:30:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_alexbrogan Build systems vs. winging it.
1503347848917704707 2022-03-14 12:30:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSaaSMantra Learn to write about what your customers care about.
1503347798036692992 2022-03-14 12:30:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevLinguistic Right. Play the long game, ya know?
1503347755552550914 2022-03-14 12:30:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Sounds like common sense, but it isn't.
1503347710874816513 2022-03-14 12:29:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons 100%. Your customers write your landing page.
1503346728736595968 2022-03-14 12:26:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Building a new income stream is simple, not easy.  My advice?  Don't overcomplicate it:  - Create valuable content for a year - Listen to what questions people ask - Solve their question with a digital asset - If they need more, offer a short coaching call  Back to basics.
1503334067189829637 2022-03-14 11:35:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jefflin_persis Thanks, Jefflin!

1503034059546669060 2022-03-13 15:43:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn Wonderful! So happy to have ya.
1503002816754987015 2022-03-13 13:39:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yashasvishailly Yeah, that's a great point :)
1503002011385667590 2022-03-13 13:36:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Ooh. I love that quote.
1503001227830906887 2022-03-13 13:33:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons It's one of the best things you can hear because it allows you to operate more freely.
1503000979519807490 2022-03-13 13:32:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @websitemarketer Definitely. The faster you understand this, the more likely you are to put yourself out there.
1503000096224559110 2022-03-13 13:28:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TnvMadhav Push it out there.
1502999437739704322 2022-03-13 13:26:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The upside of Tweeting about your business:  • More intrigue • More attention • More conversations • Better feedback loop  The downside is what people will think of you.  Once you realize they don't, the downside goes away.

1502700533911597062 2022-03-12 17:38:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @madsbrodt Don't feel bad.  Remember this: it's my job.

1502698383567474694 2022-03-12 17:29:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @madsbrodt Amazing! Keep that going, Mads 🔥
1502693649959763970 2022-03-12 17:10:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drernestomd 100%. I feel good when I share my wins. I feel better when I read others.
1502693568607043584 2022-03-12 17:10:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @okcmayor Hell yeah!
1502692709357740040 2022-03-12 17:07:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Hang with people who root for your success.
1502692648871776261 2022-03-12 17:07:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @leslietcreates Yep. Everyone, please share!
1502692589975314436 2022-03-12 17:06:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevLinguistic That's a really interesting way to look at it, Arthur.
1502692500439547914 2022-03-12 17:06:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv They almost always are, IMO.
1502692467413504000 2022-03-12 17:06:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dikshayaar I love seeing others win.
1502691663868833794 2022-03-12 17:03:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> More people should share wins online.  What feels like a brag can be an inspiration for others.  So if you aren't already, please start sharing those milestones.
1502676139743092739 2022-03-12 16:01:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt Thank you, my man!

1502651424018255878 2022-03-12 14:23:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I did $90,351 in a 28-day presale for my last course.  And I followed 6 steps to do it.  Nothing complicated. All simple.  That's what my Saturday newsletter is about this week.  Join 12,127 motivated readers below👇🏻   https://t.co/aDLc4MN2pZ  https://t.co/iv9wO9Ldq3
1502631913923792896 2022-03-12 13:05:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl And you as well! I appreciate it, Arvid.  In a really cruel world, it feels like anyone building something meaningful should support others doing the same.  Hell, everyone should. Not just creators.
1502439250108854279 2022-03-12 00:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_ahmedzaidi @simonsinek I agree 1000%. I'm out here rooting for everyone.
1502376157374828547 2022-03-11 20:09:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Great thread, Matt! Rooting for you as always. Been great to get to know you this past year 🙏
1502344119632502785 2022-03-11 18:02:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Less time listening to experts.   More time listening to customers.
1502337771784093698 2022-03-11 17:36:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_bigfield @gumroad Crossed $500k there recently.   https://t.co/4tJ1SpowfB

1502330623758852101 2022-03-11 17:08:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 @heyeaslo Super epic. Wow.
1502327159003795457 2022-03-11 16:54:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAM10Mindset I like The Minimalist Entrepreneur by @shl
1502303354483052546 2022-03-11 15:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kringle I'm creating my own ecosystem of folks who collaborate.
1502303244806205441 2022-03-11 15:19:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Growth_Corner Exactly. Or "this is how Twitter SHOULD be".   Let the market decide.
1502302204627148802 2022-03-11 15:15:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @slakhyani76 It certainly is, Shushant.
1502301828222005249 2022-03-11 15:14:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wardy0006 100.
1502301773616271362 2022-03-11 15:13:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Too many short-sighted folks here on Twitter.
1502301254562852864 2022-03-11 15:11:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If tearing down other creators is part of your growth strategy, you're ngmi.
1502294470632615944 2022-03-11 14:44:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisSamp1 Always. Engagement is table stakes.
1502284690278993920 2022-03-11 14:05:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Pranay199716 Naval is a good example and his famous "How to get rich (without getting lucky)" thread is a great piece that makes people think.
1502279671966224397 2022-03-11 13:45:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregorycampion Thank you, Greg!
1502277479825920002 2022-03-11 13:37:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn @RichaaVaid More content creators should study human psychology.
1502276433112096769 2022-03-11 13:33:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shivi_jalota Keep going for it, Shivi!
1502276373867491335 2022-03-11 13:32:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyork20 100% true, Kyle.
1502276316753797125 2022-03-11 13:32:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Absolutely. Happy Friday, my man. 🙌
1502276240635478024 2022-03-11 13:32:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAM10Mindset Write, then cut 30%.
1502276170036961294 2022-03-11 13:32:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @1amitarora 100%.
1502276123769683968 2022-03-11 13:31:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RichaaVaid Yes, but many people give and never build an audience or build one very slowly. Create this type of content and you're more likely to grow faster.
1502275983763820548 2022-03-11 13:31:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Exactly. Understand human psychology and you're much more likely to win.
1502275901685477376 2022-03-11 13:31:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Damn. I might steal it :)
1502274413772816395 2022-03-11 13:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're creating content, remember:  - Educate people - Entertain people - Make people think - Empathize with people  Specific outcomes, not spray and pray.

1502069887560261634 2022-03-10 23:52:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I've found plenty of people with zero competence to have an incredible amount of confidence.   It's why we have the world we do today.

1501969713798295564 2022-03-10 17:14:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schimmeljonas Nailed it, Jonas.
1501969679912476681 2022-03-10 17:14:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nerdjfpb Exactly. Reading 50 books doesn't help. Reading one and executing on it usually does.
1501969607590043653 2022-03-10 17:13:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hey_dhruv Or the wrong one and then figuring out why you were wrong :)
1501969544054771716 2022-03-10 17:13:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shivi_jalota Exactly, Shivi.
1501969513037893632 2022-03-10 17:13:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks Yep. Reading is great. Trying is better.
1501969469488386053 2022-03-10 17:13:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @e_stradella This is the one I read.
1501966638442287123 2022-03-10 17:02:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don't read every book on entrepreneurship.  Instead, read one.  Then:  1. Create some attention online 2. Talk to your prospective customers 3. Listen to the problems they want to solve 4. Build the lightest MVP possible to solve them  Entrepreneurship is learned through action.
1501952768336031747 2022-03-10 16:06:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisvconley @JasonHershman Agreed on the valuation part, especially because most of my revenue is non-recurring, non-software.  Give me some time though :)
1501928388700905476 2022-03-10 14:30:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JasonHershman Damn. This is awesome. Massive appreciation, Jason 🙌🏻
1501917982569730049 2022-03-10 13:48:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth And why am I featured? I’ve never led SDRs and I’m not even in SaaS anymore. I guess I’ll take it?
1501916929765916674 2022-03-10 13:44:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomgarcy Google calendar and notion.

1501912229834366976 2022-03-10 13:25:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman Yep. Some of the biggest wastes of my time are productivity apps. Just say no more and stay organized.
1501910762922647556 2022-03-10 13:20:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> No productivity app will save you if you can't learn to say no.

1501196130188627969 2022-03-08 14:00:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Yep. Start with step one and then improvise over time.

1500894854414491656 2022-03-07 18:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Something I ask myself every day:  "What if I fail as a solopreneur?"  The worst outcome is I go back to work. The best outcome is the exact life I want to design.  Decent downside. Massive upside.   Remind yourself of your optionality daily.
1500838852126199811 2022-03-07 14:20:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SheikhNaveed Because when you try to serve everyone, you compete with everyone.

1500244300755611652 2022-03-05 22:58:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann It would be disingenuous to say it wasn't helpful. But I'm not sure it's the primary driver.  I haven't asked LI followers to follow me on Twitter more than maybe one time.  I think the game plan I laid out in the newsletter is accurate, but I'm sure my audience helped.

1499810499793403908 2022-03-04 18:14:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @buewho Same. I still want to get better at it.
1499810429308178433 2022-03-04 18:14:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Every minute of every day.
1499807422734639107 2022-03-04 18:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This is why I say "no" to 90% of what comes my way.  https://t.co/gEYT0Kn3Hj

1499787384111738883 2022-03-04 16:42:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edchuchaisri No preference. Ghost is beautiful though.
1499787326008045570 2022-03-04 16:42:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAM10Mindset I didn't really, but I love the fact that it keeps spam down.
1499787243111731210 2022-03-04 16:41:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare 100%. And don't opt people in who didn't truly sign up for that specific thing.
1499787155379523590 2022-03-04 16:41:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @muthukishor Correct.
1499787127164391431 2022-03-04 16:41:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Definitely love #3. Forgot to mention that.
1499743281835610113 2022-03-04 13:47:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak Smart move, Austin. Good call here.
1499743205876764672 2022-03-04 13:46:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 Thanks so much my man!
1499743016046800896 2022-03-04 13:46:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kimwillishere Helps keep the list tight.
1499738584550625283 2022-03-04 13:28:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachMacUK Get it, Mac.
1499738433685798912 2022-03-04 13:28:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thetrunkgym Nice Coach!
1499737726148648961 2022-03-04 13:25:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My newsletter has a 65% open rate.  With 13k subscribers, that seems good.  Here are 4 simple lessons I learned in the last 9 weeks.  1. Clearly define who it's for 2. Clearly define what they'll get 3. Require people to double opt-in 4. Keep it short - less than a 4-minute read
1499547218138869763 2022-03-04 00:48:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarketingMax @alxberman Appreciate it, Max. 🙌🏻
1499509783963049985 2022-03-03 22:19:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush @typeshare_co Dude. Just saw the DM. Love it!  So pumped to give it a try.   Lemme beta test on LI.
1499492509818527754 2022-03-03 21:10:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector One of my new faves. Thanks, Josh!
1499487278695071746 2022-03-03 20:50:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alxberman @stephenpratley Appreciate the shout, Stephen. Cheers.
1499473564013051910 2022-03-03 19:55:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trop_artistry Because it is true.
1499473465790840838 2022-03-03 19:55:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @karlastarr This made me laugh 😂
1499448260196458500 2022-03-03 18:14:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Hayden_Feral Look at your GDrive or Notion and there's likely a document or process or system that you use that would be worth money to people.
1499433503410343943 2022-03-03 17:16:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Easy peasy.
1499433455658184711 2022-03-03 17:16:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachMacUK Appreciate that, Coach!
1499433398745632769 2022-03-03 17:15:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LanceEinerson Not a pro move.
1499433345817759754 2022-03-03 17:15:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcgillmd921 Probably $5k
1499429922732969986 2022-03-03 17:02:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone has at least $1,000 of side income just sitting on their GDrive.
1499413002373808130 2022-03-03 15:54:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sankalpdomore Not starting 5 years earlier. Wasting too much time on tech.
1499389969474981894 2022-03-03 14:23:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NatashaTynes Thanks so much, Natasha. I appreciate you sharing.
1499386785419382784 2022-03-03 14:10:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoeHolka Thanks so much. I appreciate that!
1499384913258287104 2022-03-03 14:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheMeerShahid Everyone feels lost in the beginning. You just need a plan, and to test against it. Then analyze and try again.
1499384623490646023 2022-03-03 14:02:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoeHolka Sure. Probably a great way, this was just based on what I do.
1499383206541504515 2022-03-03 13:56:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reesemojica Yep. Long game!
1499376973805756418 2022-03-03 13:31:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaronhayslip Also a great option. No "right" way to do it, this is just how I do it. Podcasts are probably awesome for that.
1499376882848047105 2022-03-03 13:31:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yourpalomar I read 2 newsletters: One daily, and one that comes to me on Saturday over coffee.
1499376794608324609 2022-03-03 13:30:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hiyabodhi Correct. Nothing is "for sure". Just increased and decreased likelihoods.
1499376720675282947 2022-03-03 13:30:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Love that, Keyur. Get your foundation right.
1499374049662840835 2022-03-03 13:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're a solopreneur, remember:  - Social content builds attention - Long-form guides/newsletters build trust - Community builds long-lasting relationships  Invest in these 3 things, and revenue is a likely outcome.
1499120489817686027 2022-03-02 20:32:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSalBshow So do it in a way that you don’t find cringey. At some point, you’ll just have to get over that. Ya know?
1499114730446807046 2022-03-02 20:09:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister Yep. The ol' presell lesson. :) Been there.
1499114645264769028 2022-03-02 20:09:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSalBshow Cool. Best way is to go help a company in exchange for proof. I did that early on. Do a few projects. Get proof. Then use your NDA'd company as part of the story and social proof but use the numbers from the clients you helped.
1499114386367070216 2022-03-02 20:08:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachMacUK  https://t.co/5WTEZ1sxEA
1499113784111206401 2022-03-02 20:05:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSalBshow What do you do for a living?
1499113649809592323 2022-03-02 20:05:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachMacUK Definitely. Screwing things up has a real way of making the next version so much better.
1499113255691767814 2022-03-02 20:03:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley @washingtonpost Here's $1,800 to not do something that will likely be a critical part of growing any meaningful business in the future should you decide to build one.  Smart.
1499112836508880896 2022-03-02 20:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls @jessievbreugel This is the nicest kind of compliment I can get. Thank you.
1499112717793308677 2022-03-02 20:01:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m I feel those. I look back at copy from 3 years ago and yikes.
1499112647370940416 2022-03-02 20:01:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheSalBshow Ask a few here and I'll do my best to answer.
1499111882594078721 2022-03-02 19:58:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano My life has gotten significantly easier since I learned the importance of systems. Highly agree here.
1499111842198790146 2022-03-02 19:58:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD This was me 3 years ago. I did this every single time. I still find myself getting stuck on this.   Tough habit to break.
1499111632504557570 2022-03-02 19:57:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeoffTRoberts Ooh. Did that before :)
1499111211694178304 2022-03-02 19:55:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisojones Yep. Starting earlier is always my anaswer.
1499111121005035520 2022-03-02 19:55:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoachMacUK Been there, done that.
1499110936816271373 2022-03-02 19:54:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thetrunkgym Always mine...
1499110909943468036 2022-03-02 19:54:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KHendersonCo Ahh. Damn. Just send me a DM and I'll say "SHIP IT!"
1499110818604015616 2022-03-02 19:54:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CarolynneAlex How did you apply this next time? Great lesson to learn.
1499110522599485443 2022-03-02 19:52:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MontanaOvikian @aaditsh Thank you, Montana!
1499110467763064842 2022-03-02 19:52:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @clayton_cheddr Yep. Test first, then invest. I've made this mistake.
1499110367229890575 2022-03-02 19:52:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gentoftech Yep. Audience first, then productize/serve.
1499110292005003269 2022-03-02 19:52:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @umut_sonmez Solo channel. That resonates. Why I started on Twitter recently.
1499110213613506562 2022-03-02 19:51:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaysen_sutton Damn. These are 2 that resonate for sure.
1499110169120280576 2022-03-02 19:51:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness Always my answer.
1499110136257855495 2022-03-02 19:51:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Made that early on for sure.
1499109055972917252 2022-03-02 19:47:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What's the biggest mistake you've made in your online business?
1499096555147698183 2022-03-02 18:57:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shakemktg @joe_portsmouth @nevmed Oh sweet! Thanks!
1499075524919975944 2022-03-02 17:33:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OhHeyAlejandro I think so for sure.  Perhaps through email, AMAs, live events, etc.  There's no right way to do it, I just think it's good to be cognizant of the step.
1499075305843175428 2022-03-02 17:32:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @doradevasher Great stuff, Dora. Thanks for the mention!
1499050333569486851 2022-03-02 15:53:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bentossell Such a great thread and cheers to you on the sale, Ben. I’m a makerpad customer and was genuinely so thrilled when this happened. 🥂
1499017094016520192 2022-03-02 13:41:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheWritingGuru Yep. Most of what we give away for free can be monetized. Pretty common to see people forget that.
1499014048247070728 2022-03-02 13:29:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GPastural They'll come around :)
1499012662533017612 2022-03-02 13:24:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChanReed_ Exactly, Chan.
1499012630274576386 2022-03-02 13:23:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare The common sense we have isn't always common to others.
1499011841611255814 2022-03-02 13:20:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One-person business simplified:  - Think of help you've provided for free - Find more people who need that - Charge money instead  It's been there all along.   Asking for $$ makes it a business.
1499006410004250630 2022-03-02 12:59:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Thanks man. I only break it down because I’ve screwed it all up so many times that mistakes become obvious.
1498832482745081864 2022-03-02 01:28:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Many hugs and love my friend. Can’t wait to come to SF and hang with you and Cody. Cheers.
1498810167793754112 2022-03-01 23:59:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak "How I'll do it" is often better than "How I've done it".
1498809715274534916 2022-03-01 23:57:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MeetKevon Saying 1 thing, 1,000 different ways will get you significantly further than saying 1,000 things.
1498786154946220033 2022-03-01 22:24:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonleowsg I had a LinkedIn newsletter and inconsistent blogging. I actually treat certain LinkedIn posts as trust builders as well. Today's is a good example.
1498761123872530435 2022-03-01 20:44:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DeniseWakeman @TheTiltNews Thanks for sharing my thread, Denise. Much appreciated. 🙌
1498759808765341699 2022-03-01 20:39:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush @RobbieCrab @amandanat @ShaanVP @dvassallo Bringing the heat with these threads, Tobi. Keep 'em coming. 🔥
1498759610236350464 2022-03-01 20:38:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen Wait...what?  Hustler 😂
1498759412844048389 2022-03-01 20:37:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WesleyRGarner @thisiskp_ I dunno, to be honest.
1498758234022334465 2022-03-01 20:33:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ This Tweet should be 100x more popular than it is.  I've never thought of it like that, and I love it.  Great stuff, KP.
1498757659205509128 2022-03-01 20:30:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OwenSammarone Sweet. I'll take it :)
1498756714342105089 2022-03-01 20:27:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OwenSammarone I did. I wasn't aware of that account.
1498756668984897544 2022-03-01 20:26:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tim_Denning Definitely. Automation is the movement. The relationships and engagement must be genuine.   Good call, Tim.
1498738489562705920 2022-03-01 19:14:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector This is great.  I love #6 (no lead magnets), #8 (one topic), and #11 (everything is too long).  #3 is one I struggle with. I never had an email list until 9 weeks ago, and I've been able to monetize that non-email "audience".  Great thread. Sharing in my community.
1498735812803973126 2022-03-01 19:03:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schemingbilly I love this, Colin.
1498735726447505412 2022-03-01 19:03:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marktenenholtz Trust is the truest way to move someone into a real relationship.   I don't want relationships with authority. I want them with people I trust.
1498735621455728654 2022-03-01 19:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edchuchaisri I prefer to do everything underneath my own name. Just a preference.
1498735558125883398 2022-03-01 19:02:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VladPasca5 Thanks so much, Vlad. I appreciate that.
1498717888626180099 2022-03-01 17:52:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @digi__yadav Thanks, Digi!
1498717770124513285 2022-03-01 17:52:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Thanks, Nicolas. I'm sure this exists somewhere already but hell...I'll take it.
1498717670631424001 2022-03-01 17:51:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shrutisachdeva Lack of space. I do in the longer form article.
1498717282637340673 2022-03-01 17:50:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevLinguistic 100% Arthur. You nailed it.
1498717216589725697 2022-03-01 17:50:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Gotta have your audience best interest in mind.
1498715752295186432 2022-03-01 17:44:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's a wrap!  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. RT to share this thread with your audience 2. Check out my deep dive on building your creator funnel here:   https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE
1498715744766468104 2022-03-01 17:44:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Summary  Get discovered ex: Twitter &amp; LinkedIn ↓ Build trust ex: weekly newsletters ↓ Build relationship ex: community ↓ Monetize ex: online courses
1498715742509936642 2022-03-01 17:44:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ A few additional notes (cont.)  The top of the funnel is where most people fail.  They don't spend enough time getting discovered.  So, in 2022, work on discovery, and then add your trust builder.  Getting these 2 things right makes the latter half of the funnel 10x easier.
1498715734867861511 2022-03-01 17:44:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ A few additional notes  Obviously, none of this matters if you're just focused on monetization.  You have to genuinely care about your audience and their success.  You must deliver high-quality products and, more importantly, results.
1498715732875653129 2022-03-01 17:44:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Monetization  With a captive audience of supporters, monetization is easier.  You can deliver:  • SaaS • A course • Coaching calls • Cohort-based coaching  And offer it directly through your community.  No algorithm or open rates to deal with.  Just a captive audience.
1498715723857858566 2022-03-01 17:44:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Relationship building  You can continue to build trust through email.  At some point though, you must move from trust → building relationships.  This is where my community comes in.  Members join to deepen their relationship with me and our other motivated members.
1498715720573755393 2022-03-01 17:44:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Trust building  Next is turning attention into trust.  Trust meaning, "I trust this person knows their stuff."  My trust builder is my newsletter.  It shows people how I think at a deeper level.  BONUS: It also "de-platforms" my closest followers to my email list.
1498715718401110020 2022-03-01 17:44:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Discovery  Discovery means getting noticed.  The easiest way is to create where people are consuming.  Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.  And the content that works falls into 3 styles:  - Teach me - Entertain me - Make me think  None of this works without a little attention.
1498715716215844871 2022-03-01 17:44:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> First, why should you care?  The creator funnel is how you build a simple journey for your audience.  There are 4 distinct parts:  - Discovery - Trust building - Relationship building - Monetization  Getting these right maximizes your chance to make a living as a creator.
1498715713200078852 2022-03-01 17:44:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The Creator Funnel 101  The concept of the "creator funnel" is critical to understanding audience growth, networking, and monetization.  But what is it and how does it work?  Here’s The Creator Funnel 101  🧵
1498688291142578185 2022-03-01 15:55:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KeshTFE I think this is the closest thing:   https://t.co/eRuYU20kqZ
1498661510737969156 2022-03-01 14:08:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Or that don't actually have a personal brand.
1498661334141087753 2022-03-01 14:08:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak The world favors the prepared.
1498659711402528770 2022-03-01 14:01:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Thanks so much, Luke!
1498655153402040323 2022-03-01 13:43:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @codebeef_ @dickiebush And it's a step that's often skipped.
1498655106392276992 2022-03-01 13:43:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eanorv @dickiebush Sure does, Ethan. Gotta nail the whole thing.
1498650488295854089 2022-03-01 13:24:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @canopassoftware @dickiebush Certainly. Thanks for reading.
1498650455198547976 2022-03-01 13:24:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP @dickiebush Right? No need.
1498650425171582979 2022-03-01 13:24:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare @dickiebush Ooh. Love that, Keyur 🔥
1498649425329233921 2022-03-01 13:20:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @onebrightblake @abhishekshah173 @austinbelcak Thank you, my man :)
1498649022692737028 2022-03-01 13:19:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When copywriting, @dickiebush says focus on the big 4:  • Here's your problem • Here's the benefit of solving it • Here's why what you've tried has failed • And here's a product that will help you solve it  Take it from a guy with 165k followers &amp; a booming writing business.
1498478160165359619 2022-03-01 02:00:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bssaleeb @dvassallo Yeah totally. I agree 100%.
1498478079156629507 2022-03-01 01:59:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo That makes sense, thanks, Daniel.  Sounds like doing what's reasonable without taking it to an extreme is the way to go.   Realize that's petty much common sense as I type it out.
1498475860701102083 2022-03-01 01:51:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Curious about your thoughts on preparation vs. paranoia?   The hypochondriac gets legitimately sick one day. I'm not sure their preoccupation is worth it, in the end.
1498452763344318471 2022-03-01 00:19:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephegger You too, my man. Have a great night! 🤝
1498451166371397636 2022-03-01 00:12:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephegger It's a good conversation!  I see lots of people use templates. Marketers, salespeople, authors, musicians, movie writers, etc.  Everyone wants predictability.  It's important (to me) that we don't treat social media creators differently when they do the same. That's all.
1498439625165189120 2022-02-28 23:27:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrFeresh @fourthbrainai Nice!
1498435941530284033 2022-02-28 23:12:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JWellsCFO @stephegger 🤷‍♂️  https://t.co/9OA3w2sIEw
1498434678998675460 2022-02-28 23:07:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephegger Lastly, you were surprised to learn that I (sometimes, by the way) use templates.  Sounds like I couldn't possibly be robotic if it wasn't noticeable.
1498434211245604871 2022-02-28 23:05:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephegger Counterpoint:  James Clear writes his newsletter in the same format every week. A template. Still authentic.  Authentic meals are made with recipes. A template. Still authentic.  I have hundreds of templates, all created by me.  Just vessels to deliver information.
1498431635750072326 2022-02-28 22:55:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephegger If I have something meaningful to share, putting it into a proven structure doesn’t make it any less meaningful, authentic or genuine.   I find it interesting that people are surprised that I have systems, processes and templates.   This is my job. Ya know?
1498430322794545156 2022-02-28 22:50:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephegger If I have proven formulas, absolutely.
1498416653012504581 2022-02-28 21:55:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @NatashaTynes @dickiebush @AliAbdaal @ranasweis @david_perell Awesome. Thanks, Natasha!
1498398401364475904 2022-02-28 20:43:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Eldavinn_3FA I don't have fear of failing. Failure is a data point. The long game rewards people who keep playing.
1498398283861041153 2022-02-28 20:42:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daltonkjensen @Denis__Shatalin @agazdecki Thank you, Dalton!
1498365552271794176 2022-02-28 18:32:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brennan_decker Boom! Love that. Congrats.
1498360252378537994 2022-02-28 18:11:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bentossell Damn. This is such actionable advice. Perfectly encapsulated.
1498359383927009286 2022-02-28 18:08:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArrigoLupori Yeah I understand that. If you nail the idea though…matters a lot less
1498359360963198977 2022-02-28 18:08:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Haha. Love that Keyur. True story.
1498358822859124744 2022-02-28 18:05:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Thanks my man 🙌🏻🙌🏻
1498358145684488193 2022-02-28 18:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Simple solopreneurs win.  1% go from idea to MVP in a day.  99% get stuck:  - Trying to find the coolest domain name - Crowdsourcing opinions from strangers - Running polls to pick the "right" software - Designing a logo before they have anything to sell  Ship. Then complicate.
1498339629858267139 2022-02-28 16:49:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @e_stradella I like the templates built into Typeshare. They make thread ideas easy. I love Hypefury too. I use it every day.
1498329575339798533 2022-02-28 16:09:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @guyfosel Thanks, Jon! I’ve got distribution so I figured I might as well use it.
1498299711220228101 2022-02-28 14:11:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush @typeshare_co Bring it on. I’ll be your happiest customer. Can’t wait! 👏
1498294879302074371 2022-02-28 13:51:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @leemarkum @thecodinghigh Thanks, Lee!
1498293328697344002 2022-02-28 13:45:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vvilltaylor I use the $49/month plan (don't remember what it's called) because I can cross-post to LinkedIn.
1498293168672055296 2022-02-28 13:45:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 @amandanat Great stuff, Tobi. Thanks so much for featuring me here. I greatly appreciate it 🙌
1498289663580192768 2022-02-28 13:31:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adammarx13 Same. Organizing them with Twitter blue has been best.
1498289613252792320 2022-02-28 13:30:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ericwallcopy Welcome!
1498289591282974723 2022-02-28 13:30:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregoryjhickman It's where I build out all of my writing templates.
1498289427843530754 2022-02-28 13:30:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewmcbarnett  https://t.co/IJmc2ZlQgV
1498289409631866886 2022-02-28 13:30:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rajkbnp Nice. It's best in Twitter Blue where you can organize different folders.
1498289356242571272 2022-02-28 13:29:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randomshenans Ha. Works for some, I'm sure.
1498289317189496832 2022-02-28 13:29:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP It's great for threads (and articles too)
1498288396564938758 2022-02-28 13:26:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Sharing on Twitter has never been easier.  Here are 4 tools I use to streamline the process:  - Notion for templates - Bookmarks for inspiration - Hypefury to schedule &amp; publish - Typeshare for Twitter thread ideas  Systems make it more likely that you'll stay consistent.
1498050078547877889 2022-02-27 21:39:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvansNifty Absolutely found this fascinating to watch. What a cool skill you have.
1498049876529139713 2022-02-27 21:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvansNifty This is amazing! Thank you for this.
1498024374099714057 2022-02-27 19:56:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @evielync @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Thanks for watching, Ev!
1498024344873799688 2022-02-27 19:56:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GDeckernews Good stuff, Geoff. Glad my comment helped! 🙌
1497989767182503943 2022-02-27 17:39:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @heydannymiranda I say the community space still needs a true all-in-one player on the synchronous side. I'd pick Discord.  Async, Circle/MN seems to be the way to go, but they lack engagement.
1497965369432158223 2022-02-27 16:02:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 Well that sounds pretty awesome. Thanks! 🙏
1497951422377246723 2022-02-27 15:07:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timcroft 👆🏻 This is the formula. Go back 2-3 years and think about who you were and what you wish you knew. That's the stuff right there.
1497942416703340552 2022-02-27 14:31:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @divyak316 It's definitely incorrect. Glad you realized it.
1497942367843799043 2022-02-27 14:31:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GianSeehra Certainly a helpful way to look at it.
1497942326488051715 2022-02-27 14:30:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gobienan Just impostor syndrome. You know more than you think.
1497942270326284293 2022-02-27 14:30:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hSanat @sivers He's one of my all-time favorites.
1497942236817940490 2022-02-27 14:30:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matt_Mastando Absolutely. Thanks for reading it, Matthew.
1497942198997946372 2022-02-27 14:30:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Yep. Consider where you were 2-3 years ago, and build things for that person.
1497941135016275972 2022-02-27 14:26:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Reminder to all solopreneurs:  Something very obvious to you is worth a lot of money to someone else.  Have a great Sunday.
1497650262479093764 2022-02-26 19:10:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GDeckernews @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush This is awesome. Thanks, Geoff!
1497589925981609988 2022-02-26 15:10:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andymewborn Thanks man :) It feels natural given my background. I'm thankful for the past for sure.
1497585121075019783 2022-02-26 14:51:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shusmo @ElfaidiAyata Thanks, my man 🙌
1497582098990960643 2022-02-26 14:39:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Yep. My background is a CRO, so this basically comes from running sales teams.
1497580474503467018 2022-02-26 14:33:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shusmo Much appreciated, Khaled 💪
1497579348102107146 2022-02-26 14:28:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonGrittini I love hearing that. My goal is to break things down to their most simple core. I hope that's working!
1497578660232056833 2022-02-26 14:25:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonGrittini Thanks so much, Brandon!
1497578601968975881 2022-02-26 14:25:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Exactly. That's what a good funnel does.
1497577975679799296 2022-02-26 14:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A "creator funnel" is a powerful framework for building an audience, gaining trust, and earning income online.  My newsletter breaks it down from top to bottom today.  Grab it here →  https://t.co/ykHFvCj2yE  https://t.co/XOXIk4FGoq
1497577389454409734 2022-02-26 14:20:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonsmcc Thank you so much, Jason!
1497572450577567753 2022-02-26 14:01:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl The amount of time people spend looking for shortcuts is certainly puzzling.  Pick a channel for growth, try it, and then analyze and shift.   Over time, you'll learn everything you need to know about it.  Then pick another.
1497342057391685632 2022-02-25 22:45:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool @jspector @Kjellvdv @ThisIsSethsBlog @TimFerrissShow @stephsmithio @JamesSchramko @FerraroOnAir @thedankoe Appreciate the kind shout, Josh! 🙌 @thedankoe also happens to be a really good interviewer.  All credit to him.
1497273930431836165 2022-02-25 18:14:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomfallowfield @CharlotCrowther @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @arvidkahl It was a great comment. No “right” way to do it so the more options, the merrier! 💪🏻
1497258999640727559 2022-02-25 17:15:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BriceTrophardy @ship30for30 @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Thanks for joining, Brice! I hope you love the course 🔥
1497255601126182912 2022-02-25 17:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CharlotCrowther @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 There is little point in building a product if there is no audience to buy it.  Getting discovered is, above all, the most important part of the funnel (IMO).
1497245591939817478 2022-02-25 16:22:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Had a great time. Looking fwd to chatting with you later today, Matt. 🙌
1497220790604890118 2022-02-25 14:43:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NatashaTynes @hypefury @getshieldapp @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 Thanks for tuning in, Natasha 🙌
1497214407021051915 2022-02-25 14:18:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yytambaya_ Bingo. Nailed it.
1497209042707656706 2022-02-25 13:57:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @swaycopy Ha. See? I'm not full of shit.
1497207343649411077 2022-02-25 13:50:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @McLovin_Murat @dennishegstad I don't agree that not "everyone can do it".   We never say that about any other profession.
1497204286861754377 2022-02-25 13:38:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAM10Mindset No right answer. It's whatever you want to do with it.
1497203030063726592 2022-02-25 13:33:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegoldsuite Definitely. There is no "right" way to do it.  But if you have a skill from work that's in demand, and you don't have anything in your contract preventing you from servicing others...  Great way to start.
1497202394719047681 2022-02-25 13:30:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons @Tobieh87 If you have a skill, go sell that skill on the market. That's all I mean.
1497202298749075463 2022-02-25 13:30:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennishegstad I think people tend to fall into 2 camps when trying:  1. Wild overcomplicaters: Have 13 pieces of tech before they even make a dollar.  2. Fast-movers: Don't even have a landing page, just send an invoice via Stripe.  The latter is so much easier.
1497201936180731912 2022-02-25 13:28:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matt_Mastando It's a much safer way to get started.
1497201006282788866 2022-02-25 13:25:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Side hustles before solopreneurship.  Here's how to start your first one:  1. Take whatever thing you do at your work 2. Talk about that thing every day online 3. Find people who need that thing 4. Do that thing for them too  Congrats. You have a side hustle.
1496976115000573952 2022-02-24 22:31:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chddaniel @NatashaTynes @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Ha. I'm much less cool than I look. But thank you.

1496852006463586315 2022-02-24 14:18:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewbryder This is 100% true.
1496850651661635592 2022-02-24 14:13:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simplify_thrive 100%. We must learn to accept as well.  If all we do is give and feel bad about receiving, we're missing our opportunity to allow others to give to us.
1496842003405058048 2022-02-24 13:38:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @moonfactorapp It is the case. If it's not resonating, try helping in a different way. What you find helpful and valuable may not be to others.
1496841836589166595 2022-02-24 13:37:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks Awesome. Just followed.
1496841782100959235 2022-02-24 13:37:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls Exactly. You can build an incredible network simply by helping time after time.
1496841701402419201 2022-02-24 13:37:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JackSaaS The people that treat it that way generally lose...
1496841647736475658 2022-02-24 13:37:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schemingbilly Love this, Colin. Even if it's small, people will continue to say your name...
1496841566798991362 2022-02-24 13:36:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Yep. Usually in high multiples.
1496837961429569538 2022-02-24 13:22:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @William3Willis I've found it comes back in high multiples, which is the whole point.
1496837336960753667 2022-02-24 13:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is a Karma game.  I'm convinced that helping others over the course of your career is the single greatest investment you can make.  Those that succeeded without this are the exception, not the rule.
1496654733251129349 2022-02-24 01:14:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SteveBrusell @iamwillcannon @blackhatwizardd @OneJKMolina @agazdecki @microacquire @NathanLatka @awilkinson @theryanking @landforce @JamesonCamp @wizofecom Appreciate the follow, Steve. 🙌🏻
1496623913341755395 2022-02-23 23:12:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @geoff_l @dickiebush Diversification. New challenge. Different writing style. Completely different people. Etc.
1496622595634085891 2022-02-23 23:06:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons @ecomchasedimond @blackhatwizardd @SeanAnthonySays Good stuff, Max! Keep 'em coming.

1496569451898191873 2022-02-23 19:35:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Pavlos__21 I didn’t say there was anything wrong with it.
1496532959012298752 2022-02-23 17:10:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_bigfield Me too. But I often find myself working hard.
1496531851061743627 2022-02-23 17:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VibhorChandel Sometimes.
1496531804756578310 2022-02-23 17:06:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GarreisJonathan Ha. I think a lot of people might.
1496531749328805893 2022-02-23 17:05:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RajKSarma Potentially both?
1496531719910010883 2022-02-23 17:05:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_grumpypancake_ Nope. It's wrong to tell people one thing while doing the exact opposite.
1496531657377071106 2022-02-23 17:05:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @William3Willis Oh yeah. Don't forget those check ins.
1496530824027594758 2022-02-23 17:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most people telling you to "work smart" are workaholics.
1496522928841805830 2022-02-23 16:30:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jordangodbey Thanks, Jordan! 🙌🏻
1496509787244314625 2022-02-23 15:38:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamwillcannon Appreciate you, Will! 🙌
1496482192045879305 2022-02-23 13:48:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ShaunEls The best.
1496482149771493386 2022-02-23 13:48:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Yep. That's the best kind of "networking".
1496477523630243854 2022-02-23 13:30:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kunal_KumarJ Nailed it, Kunal.
1496477485684477957 2022-02-23 13:30:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Sabahet17 Certainly. But it's easier when you make noise.
1496477330310639619 2022-02-23 13:29:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Definitely, Max.
1496477297074974720 2022-02-23 13:29:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @codebeef_ Ha. That is pretty funny.
1496475704212570129 2022-02-23 13:23:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The easiest way to "network" is to do interesting things &amp; attract interesting people.
1496473442446622724 2022-02-23 13:14:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Damn, now that's a true statement if I've ever heard one.

1496215452539834373 2022-02-22 20:08:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wellsprngoutrch Heck yeah. Glad you enjoyed it, Patricia. Good luck!
1496215352426041352 2022-02-22 20:08:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scott_bair Thank you, my man!
1496187786860367876 2022-02-22 18:19:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen Appreciate the share, Damon.  Your tools are a big part of how I operate. Thanks for creating them!

1496183568128790533 2022-02-22 18:02:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_Alex_Adamov Thanks, my man 🙌
1496182553627275275 2022-02-22 17:58:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro Sometimes I'll reach out to a group of affiliates to coordinate a big day when we all ask. Give them a slightly higher percentage.
1496182417421484037 2022-02-22 17:57:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Thank you so much, Blake.  Systems are what keeps me focused and moving in the right direction.  Figured others could benefit from it. Thanks for reading!
1496178020561920006 2022-02-22 17:40:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gjsequeira Give people what they are looking for and do it at a very reasonable price.  If you can take someone from point A to point B in 45 minutes, you've saved them time and likely helped make them money.
1496175789691355138 2022-02-22 17:31:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the_star_man 1. Whatever you know how to use already.  Gumroad is easiest, Kajabi is most robust.  2. I don't focus on production value really at all.  People want the information.
1496175005469716483 2022-02-22 17:28:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matt_Mastando Definitely. You'll thank yourself in the long run.
1496174123847929857 2022-02-22 17:24:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomfallowfield Thanks, Tom!
1496172949979766786 2022-02-22 17:20:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BasRash_ Certainly. Thanks for taking the time to read it.

1496171268873326594 2022-02-22 17:13:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen If this thread was helpful, I'd love a RT.  If you want tips like this every Saturday morning,  subscribe to my weekly newsletter →  https://t.co/Bc6J7KbNqS  This Saturday's issue is all about building your "creator funnel".   Cheers 🍻
1496171266901954562 2022-02-22 17:13:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen - No 30-day email course. - No abandoned cart emails. - No audience segmentation. - No complicated integrations.  None of these things are bad btw.  They would probably help me increase sales.  But they aren't necessary to start &amp; be successful.  So I hope you'll get started...
1496171263999594502 2022-02-22 17:13:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen 8/ Coordinate "ask" days  With helpful content, a great course, impulse pricing, and an army of affiliates, you can do this CRAZY thing to make more sales.  Ask for them. Wild huh?  90% of the time I'm giving, and 10% I'm coordinating "asks" with my affiliates.  And that's it...  https://t.co/X0IwLDKsMZ
1496171251383087108 2022-02-22 17:13:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen 7/ Create an army of happy customers who sell  After completing the course, customers receive an invite to become an affiliate.  Because I've driven 100x value, I get a very high adoption rate.  They don't drive a ton of sales, but so far I've made $9,720 in 5 months.  Not bad.  https://t.co/pXmTiQ255s
1496171232517140483 2022-02-22 17:13:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Automate testimonials  When the course is completed, I embed a  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I button inside of the last lesson. (thanks, @damengchen )  The ask is simple. A short video or text testimonial.  Then it automatically gets pumped to my landing page.  https://t.co/ekFeBi8elz
1496171211017101316 2022-02-22 17:13:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Deliver 100x value  Part of the "impulse buy" strategy is to surprise &amp; delight the customer.  Wow them.  "I spent 2k on a coach in January. Learned more in this $150 course than I did working with them." - Jubal Horton  This is the feedback I'm after 👆🏻  100x value.  https://t.co/Hw2CjBSWuQ
1496171199059087367 2022-02-22 17:13:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Create urgency with discounts  A simple 25% to 40% expiring discount (24 hours only) drives purchases.  Impulse pricing + expiring deal = sales  I average about $14k in 24 hours when I leverage discounts.  It gets seen by 50k to 80k people.  https://t.co/vTSF3tTKGP
1496171187105325059 2022-02-22 17:13:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Use "impulse buy" pricing  You don't have the social capital to sell a $1,297 masterclass. Sorry.  When people come across my products, I want them to "pull the trigger" without thinking.  So I make it easy.  $50 to $150  You're building trust. Not trying to get rich.  https://t.co/gTBCTW7L1s
1496171174421794821 2022-02-22 17:13:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Listen for signals  By creating valuable content, you'll start getting traction.  Look for signals in questions:  - How do you do X? - I'd love to learn more about Y - Can you give me advice about Z?  You want to help people! Answer these to create a simple course that does.
1496171167513784326 2022-02-22 17:12:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Create content to get discovered  Start by looking backward at your life &amp; career.  Where were you 2-3 years ago?  What do you wish you knew then that you know now?  Turn that into 4 types of content:  1. Educational 2. Entertaining 3. Contrarian 4. Empathetic
1496171165244702734 2022-02-22 17:12:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Online courses are money-makers.  But contrary to what you've been told, selling them isn't complicated.  THREAD: An 8-step system to more online course sales.  🧵
1496130989323702274 2022-02-22 14:33:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinbelcak 80% give, 20% ask
1496122842005528578 2022-02-22 14:00:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dovhyi True. It's not an absolute rule (what I mentioned earlier, I mean).
1496121749842415617 2022-02-22 13:56:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dovhyi By understanding your craft deeply.
1496116197364060166 2022-02-22 13:34:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tobieh87 That's right. Study your craft until you know it like the back of your hand.   Confidence comes from being excellent at something.
1496116044431245312 2022-02-22 13:33:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tapuzed Mostly talking to people who could be doing big things, but haven't convinced themselves that they "deserve" it.
1496113559335538694 2022-02-22 13:24:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jack_retty It's just human instinct.
1496113507753943042 2022-02-22 13:23:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_Alex_Adamov Funny how that happens, ya know?
1496113452024315905 2022-02-22 13:23:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Nailed it, Keyur. But it takes awhile to figure this out.
1496113392259584000 2022-02-22 13:23:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_bigfield Thanks, Victor. A must-have skill.
1496112311874080771 2022-02-22 13:19:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The older I get, the more I realize self-confidence makes all the difference.
1495929749025214466 2022-02-22 01:13:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AnaBullard4 Thanks, Ana!
1495845152878997509 2022-02-21 19:37:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andybrvt1 Here's a thread where I talk about a bunch of steps I went through to grow my business.  These all felt like risks at the time:   https://t.co/3zVqEe0ggx
1495820893788024836 2022-02-21 18:01:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @benlcollins @arvidkahl 😂
1495819202816626702 2022-02-21 17:54:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD Exactly.  Try things. Analyze. Iterate. Repeat.
1495818982288498691 2022-02-21 17:53:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Damn, Blake. This thread is absolute fire.  Understanding and accepting different circumstances is so critical. There are always people with more, and always people with less.  Go out there and perform regardless. People will root for you.
1495818397359222795 2022-02-21 17:51:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MennellaNick I'll do a newsletter on it.
1495818078369767431 2022-02-21 17:49:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj Exactly. This is the portfolio of small bets approach. We're speaking the same language here, my man.
1495817962661498891 2022-02-21 17:49:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP I try not to take too many big risks at all. I just take many small ones.
1495817893203877889 2022-02-21 17:49:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MennellaNick Launching my community. Pre-selling a course. Writing.
1495817811423375362 2022-02-21 17:48:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Thanks, Mike!
1495817686923755525 2022-02-21 17:48:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl Threw my back out...walking.   Welcome to my early 40s.
1495817316994539530 2022-02-21 17:46:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It feels like 90% of being an entrepreneur is taking small but uncomfortable risks.
1495790233887117322 2022-02-21 15:59:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ethanluket @sweatystartup @dickiebush Thanks, Ethan!
1495763587977166851 2022-02-21 14:13:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SidelineAff It's the most critical one I feel like...so much more time when you learn to say no.
1495761930249768962 2022-02-21 14:06:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This is an immediate bookmark. Damn. Good stuff, Dickie.
1495761014771621888 2022-02-21 14:03:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Write for one person. Create for one person. Solve problems for one person.  It's amazing how 1 becomes many through consistency.
1495758554619334659 2022-02-21 13:53:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KagoMario @alexgarcia_atx Great point, Mario.

1495753776761876484 2022-02-21 13:34:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Yep. Go deep, not wide to start.
1495753065038860289 2022-02-21 13:31:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx Clarity &gt; Clever
1495751712392556545 2022-02-21 13:26:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5 lessons from 2 years of self-employment:  - If you're unsure, say no - Eliminate / automate / delegate - Chase short-term $ → miss long-term $$$ - Kind, optimistic, and positive people win out - You cannot win if you don't enjoy what you do
1495537142247927812 2022-02-20 23:13:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Great thread, Sahil.  One common trait I've found amongst my most successful friends is the ability to listen. Like, truly listen. Not for the pause.  In a world of talkers and interrupters, it's amazing how much you learn simply by being quiet.
1495498815402557440 2022-02-20 20:41:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector @annhandley Appreciate the mention, Josh! 🙌
1495496188728168451 2022-02-20 20:30:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl 👋 I would never consider myself a "marketing expert", but I'm certainly doing the latter. So, hello.
1495481240614588416 2022-02-20 19:31:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo I feel like there is a small difference between "high achievement" &amp; "high achievers".  The former is about moving up the ranks in a game of comparison. The latter is about how you approach what you do.  I try to bring the latter to what I do, but only for a few hours per day.
1495476874201473025 2022-02-20 19:14:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp Right back at you. Here we go 🚀

1495415089133936642 2022-02-20 15:08:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sladeerickson Sometimes you just gotta step into the game and see what happens, ya know?

1495408047895859209 2022-02-20 14:40:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pyewaw @QuodSoler You two nailed it.

1495407936323080201 2022-02-20 14:40:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JackSaaS Yep. Failure is just never starting.

1495404392694046720 2022-02-20 14:26:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneur tip:  When in doubt, take a little action.  Nothing provides clarity like doing something.

1495049886642982919 2022-02-19 14:57:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nomadsammey They are both valuable. No specific order.
1495047529527975944 2022-02-19 14:48:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @srahula That's awesome! Keep it going, man.
1495046225090994178 2022-02-19 14:42:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OnlyLearnOnce Critical.

1495046200906629126 2022-02-19 14:42:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Love this Tweet, Greg.
1495046158858833933 2022-02-19 14:42:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @igorbenic Haha. Sounds like a decent way to get started though.
1495046089795379200 2022-02-19 14:42:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Absolutely, Keyur.
1495046059860635650 2022-02-19 14:42:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heychazza Definitely. Overcomplication is rampant.
1495041251778912256 2022-02-19 14:23:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What powers my one-person business:  - Zoom - Twitter - LinkedIn - A website - A newsletter  What doesn't:  - High-end camera &amp; lighting - Sophisticated automation - Professional branding - Email funnels - Paid ads  Start now.  Get complicated later.

1494733986983206916 2022-02-18 18:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 99% of Twitter profiles aren't clear:  - What do you do? - What do you Tweet about? - How is your pinned Tweet related? - Why should I press the follow button?  Bring people through the funnel with clarity.
1494672038807670788 2022-02-18 13:55:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheFalanBlake Nice work!

1494664271120244736 2022-02-18 13:25:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build a brand where people want to follow you and companies want to hire you.  Such incredible leverage.

1494368260518780930 2022-02-17 17:48:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector It sure doesn't. I know it first hand.

1494330646759493639 2022-02-17 15:19:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @srahula Maybe someday. Not sure of the impact. I hate it too.
1494305145936568326 2022-02-17 13:38:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MontanaOvikian Exactly.
1494305113246154760 2022-02-17 13:37:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adltyagaur Everyone needs products at different price points to meet the needs of diverse customers.

1493999882117468169 2022-02-16 17:25:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KeshTFE Build an audience first.  Look for buying signals. Once people start asking, then toss up a landing page and see who pays.  Don't build something nobody wants to buy.
1493999701166800901 2022-02-16 17:24:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisRocas We shall see.
1493996320096501769 2022-02-16 17:10:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thebrandanhall Agree, 100%. I also think community owners and folks who want to build communities vastly underestimate the work involved to make a community great.
1493995786857820168 2022-02-16 17:08:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theandreboso True story. Working on that now. Just need to get it all straightened out.
1493995014384500739 2022-02-16 17:05:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matt_Mastando Nice, Matthew. It works.
1493994981102653445 2022-02-16 17:05:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rpguerreiro Definitely. I'm not an NFT/web3 guy, but I'm certain this is true.

HEY is all about never even receiving emails from people you don't want to get them from.  I absolutely freaking love it.

1493982275964485634 2022-02-16 16:15:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano Same. I think I would choose Google Calendar. How lame 😂

It's not: "Learn how to invest in the market."  It's: "In less than 1 hour, you'll learn to invest your first $10k in the market without an expensive advisor."  Clarity is critical.

1493641448083927040 2022-02-15 17:40:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisRocas I sure hope so!
1493641389057495045 2022-02-15 17:40:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bentossell @carrd @zapier @stripe Some of my absolute favorites. Use all of them.
1493639996926013444 2022-02-15 17:35:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad 9/ Raise your rates  With a lower-priced product, you can now increase your coaching rates.  When people want coaching, you can coach.  When they don't, tell them about your digital product.  You now have an offering for different learning styles and price points.
1493639994354946052 2022-02-15 17:34:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad 8/ Build a digital product  Your 2nd income stream is your 1st digital product. Focused on the most common problem above.  Take someone from problem to solution in 45 minutes or less.  Keep it focused.  Single problem → single solution  Price it reasonably to build trust.
1493639992199032850 2022-02-15 17:34:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad 7/ Listen for commonalities  This is a key step to creating your 2nd income stream.  Your goal when coaching is to listen for the most common problems of your students.  - Write down every problem you hear - Dive deeper to understand them - Keep a running list  This is the gold.
1493639989988626438 2022-02-15 17:34:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro @stripe @gumroad 6/ Promote it  It's unlikely you'll get clients just because you exist.  Instead, find easy ways to promote it.  When your new followers ask you questions, tell them about your coaching business.  When you write content, share a link at the end.  Super simple stuff.
1493639987379810307 2022-02-15 17:34:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro 5/ Create a service business  A simple coaching business can be your 1st income stream.  An MVP landing page + @stripe or @gumroad to collect payments.  The key? Make the pricing a no-brainer.  You're not looking to get rich here, you're looking to learn.   (more on this)
1493639985039388676 2022-02-15 17:34:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sparktoro 4/ Create content  Next, it's time to establish credibility.  Here are some easy ways:  - Teardowns - Tweet threads - Step-by-step guides  Show the people 2-3 years behind you that you understand their challenges &amp; have solved them before.  This will gain you a small following.
1493639982589874182 2022-02-15 17:34:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Find the "you" from 2-3 years ago  Your goal is to find people who are just like you, but much earlier in their journey.  Where do they hang out online? Try places like:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - FB Groups  If you can't find them, use tools like @sparktoro to help.
1493639980249399297 2022-02-15 17:34:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Identify your interests  Inside of the list you just created, will be things you loved doing and hated doing.  Sorry, but you can't scale misery.  Choose something you built skills in, that you also enjoy doing/talking about/writing about.  This will be your core focus.

If you do, you'll never get started.  Instead, make a list of your accomplishments, big and small, over the last 2-3 years.  What skills did you learn during this period?

1491117335976955909 2022-02-08 18:30:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanking562 Certainly. Thanks for taking some of your time to read it, Ryan.

1491116539315355649 2022-02-08 18:27:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichePriest Oh, really? Cool 🔥  Glad people enjoy it.
1491114117695873026 2022-02-08 18:18:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NafetsWirth @dvassallo People asking for help with things that weren't related to my consulting business, but were instead related to how I was growing it online.
1491113137227300864 2022-02-08 18:14:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt @dvassallo That's why I joined his community. Love seeing what's working for others.
1491113005714599936 2022-02-08 18:13:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jenibayona Lift others to lift yourself.
1491111742440882176 2022-02-08 18:08:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo I was going down a SaaS consulting route 2 years ago.  Today, I'm a creator selling courses, coaching, and running a paid community for creators.  Never would have guessed it in a million years.  Never would have done it if I hadn't watched for interesting signals.
1491110458795098112 2022-02-08 18:03:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tanoy27 Appreciate you taking the time to read it, Tanoy.

1491104086317744130 2022-02-08 17:38:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chddaniel Heck yeah, my man. Keep it going!
1491103943237435392 2022-02-08 17:37:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexanderxliu I tried to grow on Twitter many times before and those things were already true.  Don't use those as reasons not to give it a shot.
1491103582976094210 2022-02-08 17:36:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_bigfield Love to hear it, Victor. Keep that going, man.

1491101917900328965 2022-02-08 17:29:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisSamp1 Always. Different strategies and tactics for different phases.
1491101726413553665 2022-02-08 17:28:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ToughenYourself Appreciate it!
1491100429601681410 2022-02-08 17:23:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond @JamesonCamp @Nicolascole77 @OneJKMolina @thedankoe @dickiebush @landforce @aaditsh @hypefury @TwemexApp @typeshare_co @TwitterBlue And that's it.  TL;DR  1/ Built publishing habit in the AM 2/ Educated my audience each PM 3/ A step-by-step thread once weekly 4/ Engage with 5-8 people in my niche each week 5/ Commented underneath large accounts 6/ Eliminated what wasn't working 7/ Setup inspiration tools
1491100419598209026 2022-02-08 17:23:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond @JamesonCamp @Nicolascole77 @OneJKMolina @thedankoe @dickiebush @landforce @aaditsh 6/ Eliminated the "touch base" Tweets  After 90 days, I had a publishing habit.  So I stopped the daily, "Happy Weekday" AM posts.  They weren't adding much value.  I started writing entertaining content or 2x'ing educational Tweets.   https://t.co/BFi6n6MWo6
1491100410509201408 2022-02-08 17:23:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond @JamesonCamp @Nicolascole77 @OneJKMolina @thedankoe @dickiebush @landforce @aaditsh 5/ Comment underneath large accounts  One of the best ways to gain visibility here is to participate.  - Find interesting, large accounts - Set up automatic notifications - Read each of their Tweets - Add valuable comments - Engage  It's literally that easy.  https://t.co/TCgokIAOnd
1491100360316006413 2022-02-08 17:23:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Engage with 5-8 interesting people each week  Make it a habit to build connections.  Here are some smart folks I've chatted with, just to jam out:  @ecomchasedimond  @JamesonCamp @Nicolascole77  @OneJKMolina  @TheDanKoe @dickiebush  @landforce @aaditsh  It's "social" media.
1491100357472227329 2022-02-08 17:23:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ A step-by-step thread once weekly  Weekly threads power my growth.  I gained thousands of followers by sharing detailed threads.  My goal is to walk someone step-by-step through something critical in solopreneurship.   https://t.co/NxMdQiFKch
1491100354850832386 2022-02-08 17:23:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ An educational tweet each PM  Each afternoon, I share a lesson from my solopreneur journey.  Topics include:  - Audience growth - Service businesses - Building info products - Using social media effectively  I pretend I'm writing to help ONE person.   https://t.co/TZgqtYRZDw
1491100349700128782 2022-02-08 17:23:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A Twitter audience is a massive asset.  I've added 37,196 followers in just 14 weeks.  Here are the 7 simple things I did:  🧵
1491077283901231106 2022-02-08 15:51:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulineRiviere @heyblake @thedankoe @tibo_maker @amandanat @Nicolascole77 @heyjoeyjustice Appreciate it, Pauline!
1491073993352577025 2022-02-08 15:38:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @immichaelh1 More important for entrepreneurs than solopreneurs (IMO) but important nonetheless.
1491054402282848257 2022-02-08 14:20:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @guerrist Damn, that's a good one.
1491050938144292869 2022-02-08 14:07:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Rodney630711 Thanks, Rodney!
1491045222281019395 2022-02-08 13:44:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndraZaharia Love that. Great addition here, Andra.
1491043912286617601 2022-02-08 13:39:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor Most sales methodologies (IMO) are created simply as moneymakers.   I still haven't found one as good and honest as Sandler. I'm sure there are many out there that would give it a run for it's money though.
1491042358661509120 2022-02-08 13:32:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @I_Grow_B2B_Orgs 100%, Jeremy.
1491042302147837952 2022-02-08 13:32:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulMarner4 Good call. Never works.
1491042246795292672 2022-02-08 13:32:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kevinbooyens Yep. Nice adds.
1491042198288465920 2022-02-08 13:32:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @write_sfc Good call, Spencer.
1491041920373575682 2022-02-08 13:31:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Definitely. Good one.
1491041875842990081 2022-02-08 13:31:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt Love those, Danny.
1491041839654510593 2022-02-08 13:30:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor Why not?
1491038904459407364 2022-02-08 13:19:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every solopreneur should study:  1. Human psychology 2. Sandler selling 3. Outsourcing 4. Copywriting 5. Community 6. Storytelling 7. Empathy  What else?
1490775674763857921 2022-02-07 19:53:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonbrosio This is 100% true.
1490754433818537988 2022-02-07 18:28:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo I agree with this 100%.  I keep hearing I "won't scale" with low-cost products, but my course business just keeps scaling.  - $79.25 ARPU in 2021.  - $193.80 ARPU in 2022.  Low-cost can unlock a great lifestyle business.

1490748007251333120 2022-02-07 18:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The easiest way to improve your life is to improve your network.
1490732377521414156 2022-02-07 17:01:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency Start earlier.
1490723450985586692 2022-02-07 16:25:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vitlyoshin Nope. You don't have enough time. I ignore most requests for advice and just automate the response.
1490710784887996419 2022-02-07 15:35:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @crossborder Been going on 3 years with this mix. Seems to be working fine.
1490710571091701768 2022-02-07 15:34:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harveygrowform I think it depends on what you’re building.   I mostly build information products so this is about right for my business.
1490692484778840067 2022-02-07 14:22:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rnplemos Mostly people asking to be on podcasts or do events that aren't really related to my audience.
1490688596264714240 2022-02-07 14:07:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thebrandanhall If I took the time to respond to 100% of them, it would be more.  But, I really only respond to serious inquiries.
1490682493841907717 2022-02-07 13:42:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenishantmodi Start publishing content online each day. Focus on one core topic and continue to create. I've been writing daily for 3 years.
1490680862106689537 2022-02-07 13:36:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thefrenchmaker DM me and I'll send you my template.
1490680011111735300 2022-02-07 13:33:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thefrenchmaker I have a really good "no" template that lets people down in a nice way.
1490679920187617284 2022-02-07 13:32:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenishantmodi Organic content. No ads for me.
1490678902666186757 2022-02-07 13:28:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @barrettjoneill That's what I'm usually saying no to!
1490678849100779525 2022-02-07 13:28:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack I'm there finally.
1490678822768885765 2022-02-07 13:28:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare True story.
1490678251261411330 2022-02-07 13:26:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is 70% marketing, 10% building, and 20% saying no via email.
1490525520941006851 2022-02-07 03:19:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Nice! Will definitely dive into this. Thanks for sharing. 🙌
1490525348794179585 2022-02-07 03:18:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 If the refund rates are the same and you sell it for 30% more, but ostracize 30% more potential buyers bc of price sensitivity, it's a wash.  You just miss the extra 30% of people spreading word-of-mouth.  My thought is to raise prices on non-course offerings. Just my approach.
1490523902640017413 2022-02-07 03:12:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 @Nicolascole77 I hope you'll give it a read and tell me what ya think. Cheers 🍻
1490523683537960960 2022-02-07 03:11:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 It's a great way to start. I'm not sure I agree it's a bad long-term strategy.  I'll cross $1M in course sales in the next few months &amp; have a refund rate of less than 0.3%  I'm actually writing my newsletter on this next weekend:  "The Myth of the high-priced Masterclass"
1490420183487418372 2022-02-06 20:20:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thetomzach I would advise that you spend some time establishing authority in your field first.  There is no right answer to audience size, but you should look for signals from your audience that they want help with something specific.
1490390254301454339 2022-02-06 18:21:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sajidCode Not true at all. Lots of great ideas are executed with very little money.
1490389767619592194 2022-02-06 18:19:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CopychiefYu Love it!
1490388004766195714 2022-02-06 18:12:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scribblykaur I don't know that a specific number matters, but you should establish some authority in your field first.
1490386824912678914 2022-02-06 18:08:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yakshitshh Nothing wrong with that.
1490386759129182209 2022-02-06 18:07:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jjeremymiller Free. Game.
1490386566585409543 2022-02-06 18:07:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matt_Mastando Correct. Parkinson’s law. It will always take you as long as you give yourself.
1490385769348878337 2022-02-06 18:03:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Online course launch 101:  - Topic you could talk about unprepared - Presell via landing page first - Focused on one outcome - Timebox 14 to 30 days - Keep it short (45 min.) - Price for impulse buy - Ask for testimonials - Upsell coaching  Start one today. You won't regret it.
1490336668179644418 2022-02-06 14:48:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn Love that comparison.
1490334831078789123 2022-02-06 14:41:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_dylancastillo @SPressfield Will check it out, thanks!
1490334791559954432 2022-02-06 14:41:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aurasky_ It certainly does, my man.
1490334739831693314 2022-02-06 14:41:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ixdninja Keep it going 🔥
1490334697221726210 2022-02-06 14:40:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaxx_sam Huge fan.  I plan on doing this more this year.
1490330503207174150 2022-02-06 14:24:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Beginners hoard ideas.  Amateurs share their ideas.  Professionals execute their ideas.
1490053312615493635 2022-02-05 20:02:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays I don’t really watch any specific channel.   I just search for anything I want to accomplish.   There’s always an answer.
1490021748112347136 2022-02-05 17:57:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisschaum I really just promoted one product last year, The Operating System.   That did about $370k in 5 months (July to Dec)
1490012445670318081 2022-02-05 17:20:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theandreboso Thank you my man. I appreciate that.
1490012040475426825 2022-02-05 17:18:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @smartercreator Less work and hopefully more income by helping more people.

1490008873712898049 2022-02-05 17:06:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daniel_ndukwu Wild, right?  Congrats, man!
1490008686059733000 2022-02-05 17:05:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt I think I sat next to you in Trig.

1489969944729116679 2022-02-05 14:31:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Ain't it though?
1489969901439787009 2022-02-05 14:31:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Denis__Shatalin This is exactly it. But, we fail to do it so often.  Stop and take notice and you'll sell more of your own.
1489968387065319426 2022-02-05 14:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Yep. Also, just pay attention to why you buy a course. Is it the email sequence? The person? The trust?
1489967822038044672 2022-02-05 14:23:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to sell more:  Pay attention to how you buy.

1489683103903801351 2022-02-04 19:31:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Leadership_MVP Some do, some don't. Those who do, purchase.  Those who don't, don't.   I'm ok with that.
1489661001175814149 2022-02-04 18:03:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EssersJe It's a big part of how I got them.

1489646414636453900 2022-02-04 17:05:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oghie_neo Share micro-lessons and learnings that keep people coming back for more.
1489646338941886467 2022-02-04 17:05:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Exactly. But just don't overcomplicate it in the beginning.
1489646257370976256 2022-02-04 17:05:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stnkvcs 😂

1489602827018289167 2022-02-04 14:12:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotechAna @amandanat This is awesome. Thanks for sharing, and for highlighting me, Ana. Cheers.
1489593794005721092 2022-02-04 13:36:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen @Faizsayyad_21 Awesome. I'll dive in, Dennis. Thanks for sharing, man.
1489591829142163461 2022-02-04 13:29:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Faizsayyad_21 100%, Faiz.
1489591794526478339 2022-02-04 13:28:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare That's a damn good tip, Keyur.
1489590842570457091 2022-02-04 13:25:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Crappy customer experience?  Write it down.  A list of problems is a list of opportunities  Then solve it:  - Better - Faster - Cheaper  Ideas are packed inside of frustration.
1489355598567288842 2022-02-03 21:50:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @estherelueme Glad you enjoyed it. Thanks, Esther!
1489286777173127174 2022-02-03 17:16:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ReprogramCoach Exactly. Makes everything much easier when you nail the problem and solution.

1489284072296042499 2022-02-03 17:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BriTheWebGuy I simply produce content that either:  - Gives people an "a-ha" moment - Teaches them something they didn't know - Makes them think about their business differently  I've found this generates inbound questions which I turn into conversations.
1489283058897494026 2022-02-03 17:02:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don't sell an online course without building credibility.  Instead:  - Figure out who you love spending time with - Talk to them about their challenges - Learn how to solve them - Share what you learn - Repeat  Do this, and you'll build a wonderful reputation.  Then sell.
1489278407938609152 2022-02-03 16:43:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt Thank you, my man 🙌
1489231281040855048 2022-02-03 13:36:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EvergreenMEP Perfection is procrastination.
1489230405991641090 2022-02-03 13:32:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Thank you so much, Jessie. Cheers, bud.  BTW - took a look at your town in CR. Looks awesome.
1489228547222917121 2022-02-03 13:25:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @codebeef_ Marketing means getting attention for your business.  Delivery is about fulfilling the promises of your service or product.
1489228423297966083 2022-02-03 13:24:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thekevinrod Exactly. You don't need to create a $1B unicorn.  Just take an average idea, promote it well, and deliver on your promises.  Congrats, you have a business.
1489227863299657734 2022-02-03 13:22:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thefrenchmaker Haha. Thanks, man. I wish I saw it that way.
1489227217452388359 2022-02-03 13:20:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship isn't about a great idea.  It's about attracting people and delivering.  average idea + great marketing + quality delivery = a viable business
1488988967823462406 2022-02-02 21:33:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blakeaburge Factual, but talked about way too little...  It's always nice to hear we're all struggling as a reminder to keep going.
1488987920854032384 2022-02-02 21:29:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KristineG18901 Both. 👀
1488974814463332361 2022-02-02 20:37:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotechAna @jlogic Right. More clear.
1488939985843601409 2022-02-02 18:18:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @seempaq @tylertringas If you're interested in using it to grow your business, I've grown mine there exclusively from the 160k followers.  Happy to chat you through it if you'd like, Tyler.
1488924252069937158 2022-02-02 17:16:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MindsetMagicc Help others for long enough and you'll get it back 1000x.
1488924139415089160 2022-02-02 17:15:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelkirsten So glad it was helpful, man. Cheers.
1488923935353806856 2022-02-02 17:15:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt Yep. Failures are much easier to digest when we learn and shift.
1488923833671290889 2022-02-02 17:14:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victor_bigfield Same here.
1488920680720654349 2022-02-02 17:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Behind every successful solopreneur is:  ∙ Ignored content ∙ Crippling self-doubt ∙ Worries about money ∙ Failed side hustle ideas ∙ Failed product launches  I don't care who it is.  Everyone has experienced it.  That's why it's so important to root for each other.
1488876840575979520 2022-02-02 14:07:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush 99% of people focus on the former, while 1% go deep on the latter.  I was literally just having this conversation with my wife. Great share, Dickie.
1488875139257311234 2022-02-02 14:01:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joewebber_ @jspector Appreciate that, Joe 🙌
1488872337135087620 2022-02-02 13:50:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_areebpasha I sure have.   https://t.co/dcmjzltc0f
1488870597924954114 2022-02-02 13:43:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_areebpasha Consulting for any SaaS company.  By the time I had niched down, I was consulting only for early-stage transactional SaaS companies in the healthcare technology vertical.
1488869368939388934 2022-02-02 13:38:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_areebpasha Started there. I had enough experience to charge that pricing.
1488865560188362754 2022-02-02 13:23:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> From burned-out exec to happy solopreneur:  2019: Quit my exec job 2019: Began consulting 2019: Rates @ $250/hr 2020: Niched down 2020: Nailed offering 2021: Rates ⬆️ 5x 2021: Built digital product 2021: Built a community 2022: Pacing 1.5M+  Forget 1-year plans. Think longer.
1488680156877275136 2022-02-02 01:06:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @constructionge3 No, it’s not.   It’s only risky if you approach it by quitting your job.   I’m advocating for a different approach.
1488605187111817216 2022-02-01 20:08:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HeyPJB Courses, coaching, community, advising, ticketed events, etc.
1488588916093603843 2022-02-01 19:03:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmeetM I do not. No children by design.
1488570797992075272 2022-02-01 17:51:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeorgeNoble07 Sure feels like it.
1488570770829807626 2022-02-01 17:51:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GCJGoncalves Thanks, Gonçalo 🙌
1488570711748878337 2022-02-01 17:51:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt Heavily.
1488570645042585604 2022-02-01 17:51:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @foliofed Oh, shit. I love that.

1488568881715331079 2022-02-01 17:44:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My business plan:   To do what I want, when I want, with whom I want.
1488562578297180170 2022-02-01 17:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @billrice @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush @heyblake Great thread, Bill! Thanks for featuring me with some other excellent folks. Much appreciated 🔥
1488511983947239424 2022-02-01 13:58:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DONVESH Agreed.  Even worse is being an expensive employee at a budget-conscious company.  You're a line item that will eventually get cut.
1488508321837436929 2022-02-01 13:43:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BuzzRobTaylor Always.
1488508301688119306 2022-02-01 13:43:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sreenathpradeep Great work, Sreenath. Keep building bud.
1488508231433531404 2022-02-01 13:43:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt Cliche for a reason. Seems like you got it going just in time, Danny.
1488508150877761540 2022-02-01 13:42:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IskanderSamatov Agreed. That's what I did.
1488508121937059840 2022-02-01 13:42:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Use your job as an investment into your solo business.
1488508042295582720 2022-02-01 13:42:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CooperKraussKC Great quote 🔥
1488507997437505546 2022-02-01 13:42:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons I love that, Max.
1488502162825043971 2022-02-01 13:19:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The idea that it's risky to build your own business is silly.  Sure, quitting your job with nothing to fall back on is risky.  But building a safety net with your skills &amp; knowledge is the safest thing you can do for yourself &amp; your family.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
1488488578170724358 2022-02-01 12:25:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LBacaj Congrats, Louie. The power of the internet, a good group of supporters, a positive mindset, and some action.  Nice work. 🔥
1488305783888568321 2022-02-01 00:18:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdarshNalam @IndieHackers Much appreciated, Adarsh. 🙌
1488255322028445704 2022-01-31 20:58:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tapuzed Very little advice is.
1488211253554302977 2022-01-31 18:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurs should adopt a portfolio strategy.  4-5 smaller income streams.  This provides much greater flexibility and reduced risk when compared to one big bet.

1488148632289300491 2022-01-31 13:54:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nickneral I feel ya. I spent over a decade in healthcare technology and the doctor's office is still the modern DMV.
1488145666895458304 2022-01-31 13:42:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sunilc_ Good stuff here, Sunil.
1488145627745853448 2022-01-31 13:42:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matdrewin Yep. Do more of what I like and less of what I don't.
1488145576680202241 2022-01-31 13:42:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Denis__Shatalin Love it, Denis. Good goals.
1488145496296366082 2022-01-31 13:41:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @viraj_vru I feel the same way, Viraj.
1488142345337987073 2022-01-31 13:29:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markomlor Thank you, Mark.
1488142311804612609 2022-01-31 13:29:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jpmhdg Same. I want to stop doing things I don't like doing.
1488142242112065537 2022-01-31 13:28:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simplytrav03 Love that mission, Travis.
1487984093094633472 2022-01-31 03:00:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tommy_Slocum Thank you my man.
1487862194272362499 2022-01-30 18:56:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I spent 10 years working for entrepreneurs and 2 years being one.   The latter taught me 100x more.
1487795169214803974 2022-01-30 14:29:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Denis__Shatalin I've seen people sell email template packages, eBooks, courses, notion boards, collections of high-performing Tweets, etc.
1487794840972795914 2022-01-30 14:28:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Publish your thoughts daily in anticipation of a future business.
1487794252574863377 2022-01-30 14:26:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Making $200k/yr selling info products broken down:  - $16.7k per month - Which is ~$540/day - Which is 4 customers @ $135/ea - Which is 285 daily web visitors at 1.4% conversion  None of this is easy.  But it's certainly easier than staring $200k in the face without a plan.
1487521377464852482 2022-01-29 20:21:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaimevelez Appreciate it, my man. 🔥

1487484782174953478 2022-01-29 17:56:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Excellent stuff. Thank you so much for including me man. 🙏
1487477309930151939 2022-01-29 17:26:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GregoryCronie Just customer service, yes.  I'm not sure why Fiverr vs. Upwork. Just found someone helpful there.
1487477174047281155 2022-01-29 17:26:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LukeWerkmeister Beautiful! Glad I could help. 🙌
1487477110457446405 2022-01-29 17:25:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scribblykaur Nailed it. 🔥
1487477071098138626 2022-01-29 17:25:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Nah. Much less expensive than my time.
1487476991075012621 2022-01-29 17:25:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD It truly doesn't. KISS.
1487476957088559104 2022-01-29 17:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Need to keep this going and create more.
1487476919742443523 2022-01-29 17:25:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @workonworkoff Haha. Courses can be bloated (just not mine).
1487471397421166601 2022-01-29 17:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I save 15+ hours per month by outsourcing.   I look for low-value, repetitive tasks in my business.   Then:  - Record a Loom video - Store in Notion w/ instructions - Teach someone on Fiverr to help - Reroute all of my customer service emails  Freedom.
1487465151142014984 2022-01-29 16:38:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @p_aab Thank you! 🤝
1487455572928651264 2022-01-29 16:00:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @learnwithvidya Yep. Impostor. Happens every day.

1487441496890646531 2022-01-29 15:04:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp It's happened to me 6x in 6 days.
1487123832997613570 2022-01-28 18:02:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You don't need Elon Musk's morning routine.  Go talk to someone a few dollars ahead of you.
1487111227306393602 2022-01-28 17:12:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amcrann @aaditsh Just triggering ideas. I track through other apps like BlackMagic, Ilo, Shield.
1487061042958147587 2022-01-28 13:52:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonleowsg @JalisoCSP Just for the templates.
1487055919947132932 2022-01-28 13:32:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Denis__Shatalin Love this, Denis.
1487055857703608323 2022-01-28 13:31:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Yep. No need to build a massive billion-dollar company either.  Just find a small problem and execute solving it.
1487055089286238210 2022-01-28 13:28:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DPirciu Yep. Ship fast and then iterate.
1487055047569690635 2022-01-28 13:28:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daniel_ndukwu Yep. And you can find problems on a much smaller scale and have a wonderful business.
1487054121974837259 2022-01-28 13:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You don't need a flashy new idea to build a business.  Go find:  - Antiquated industries - Slow companies - Poor service  Use technology to do a better job and you'll likely start chipping away.  A much easier lens to view entrepreneurship through.

1486864714214916097 2022-01-28 00:52:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ericxcn Ideas through writing and shipping. I write daily and ship daily.
1486863954077003776 2022-01-28 00:49:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Building a Twitter audience is about muscle work.  Build:  - Idea muscles by writing.  - Editing muscles by analyzing.  - Shipping muscles by publishing. - Networking muscles by engaging.  Work your muscles.  Make everything habitual.
1486754277104226310 2022-01-27 17:33:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool Create. Distribute. Repurpose. Distribute again.
1486746349601275905 2022-01-27 17:02:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneur distribution:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - HackerNews - Indie Hackers - Facebook Groups - Private Slack/Discord  If you're writing, might as well distribute.  Different customers hang in different channels.
1486743417254289410 2022-01-27 16:50:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ErinBalsa I knew you were gonna crush, Erin. So glad to have met you. Keep going!

1486692540220903424 2022-01-27 13:28:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Definitely.  When you create a business strictly for monetary reasons, it never comes off the same way as personal enjoyment.

1486690513457750019 2022-01-27 13:20:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5 steps to a one-person business:  1. Talk to people 2. Understand what they need 3. Create content that helps them achieve 4. Service them one-on-one to learn solutions 5. Package those solutions into a product over time  Talk → understand → create → service → productize

1486486169412067333 2022-01-26 23:48:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nicolasmejiar Can't wait to see what you accomplish, Nicolas. Get after it 🙌

1486481026838900745 2022-01-26 23:27:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 👏👏👏👏👏👏  Typeshare is dope, btw. Loving it.
1486479058565275648 2022-01-26 23:19:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tim_Denning Gasoline on that fire, ya know?
1486477612889382920 2022-01-26 23:14:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jlogic It sure can. Part of the reason I love it.
1486477520979509250 2022-01-26 23:13:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itstravisdavis Love it. Great place to stay organized.
1486477471541342214 2022-01-26 23:13:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sgrubb34 Thanks, Scott!
1486477442944536580 2022-01-26 23:13:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamanthaPostman I was a CRO at a fast-growing tech company and I learned a lot about systems and processes.  You can't scale a one-person business without them.
1486477292079616006 2022-01-26 23:12:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @investingdean Hopefully the matrix idea is helpful.
1486477208818491393 2022-01-26 23:12:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LearnInAwe Start by being consistent.  Once you've nailed that, add frequency to the mix.
1486473813806227456 2022-01-26 22:59:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @typeshare_co @HemingwayApp @hypefury Step 5: Stay consistent  Writing consistently is the most important step of all.  Here's the TL;DR:  • Ideate with topics/structures • Format with tools like Typeshare • Edit with tools like Hemingway • Distribute with tools like HypeFury
1486473810194935816 2022-01-26 22:59:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @typeshare_co @HemingwayApp Step 4: Distribute widely  99% of people waste distribution opportunities.  You've already written something.  Why not share it everywhere that's relevant?  I use @Hypefury to send my content to multiple platforms.  - Twitter - LinkedIn - Instagram  The tool is powerful as hell.  https://t.co/7S7P7PVDKO
1486473770470629383 2022-01-26 22:58:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 2: Choose a solid format  Struggling to format your writing?  There are so many tools out there to help.  I am loving @typeshare_co  They have beautiful templates built right in for inspiration.  No better way to get started.  https://t.co/R3sRX9drb8
1486473743270617088 2022-01-26 22:58:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 1: Ideate rapidly  What’s the fastest way to come up with ideas?  Use systems.  I created my own content matrix in Notion.  - Choose a topic - Match it to a style - Write a quick headline - Repeat until you have 10 ideas  Much of writing is about systems.  https://t.co/PCFJEpj7x8
1486473719723831306 2022-01-26 22:58:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I made $0 online in 2019.  3 years later:  - 100M+ impressions - $1.7M in online income - 4 successful revenue streams  What changed?  I started writing online every day.  Here's my simple 4-step process.  [Short 🧵]
1486467973791592448 2022-01-26 22:35:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @toomaime Use a "trust tripwire" to start.  My earliest products were underpriced and provided much more value than their cost.  Because of that, I made thousands of sales and created an army of loyal customers.  My subsequent products have increased in price, but those people still buy.
1486385932907552775 2022-01-26 17:09:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ronke_faleti Wild 😄 I love it.
1486385598747365383 2022-01-26 17:08:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMKhateeb That's basically 90% of the people out there.
1486385511572946944 2022-01-26 17:08:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ronke_faleti I love that. Interesting enough, I just learned about Yoruba the other day on YouTube :)
1486383954768928769 2022-01-26 17:02:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If it's always someone else's fault, it's probably your fault.
1486380129257463810 2022-01-26 16:46:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reneefishman You can just head to the link above and scroll down to read issues.
1486332503929536512 2022-01-26 13:37:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mike_winnet Saw it. Will shoot you a note back by EOD. Thanks, Mike.
1486331450022666244 2022-01-26 13:33:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare 💯
1486331416392650756 2022-01-26 13:33:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nt2subtle Everyday sell someone.
1486331339011940357 2022-01-26 13:33:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OliverJones_19 Yep. A skill worth practicing.
1486331294929891328 2022-01-26 13:32:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness So many people are afraid of sales.  Just talk to your customers through a lens of truly solving their problems and you're off to a good start.
1486308303307161608 2022-01-26 12:01:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasontanpc Rolling it into a new site at the moment. Thanks!
1486078047463821312 2022-01-25 20:46:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArnaudBelingaCX @_IlirAliu @tibo_maker @CreateGrowRep I agree that it’s helpful. Two notes though:  1. I started when nobody knew me or the company I worked for.   2. I watch a lot of executive leaders struggle to build their following.   95% of the reason I grew is 1,500 pieces of content without missing more than 5 days in 3 yrs
1486063281525637120 2022-01-25 19:47:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArnaudBelingaCX @_IlirAliu @tibo_maker @CreateGrowRep What do you mean by unfair advantage?
1486032139057606659 2022-01-25 17:44:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Simple solopreneurs win.  1% go from idea to MVP in a day.  99% get stuck:  - Trying to find the coolest domain name - Crowdsourcing opinions from strangers - Running polls to pick the "right" software - Designing a logo before they have anything to sell  Ship. Then complicate.
1486022926583410700 2022-01-25 17:07:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickSloggett @jackbutcher @garrytan @gregisenberg @dvassallo Appreciate that. 💪🏻

1485968737585045504 2022-01-25 13:32:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenishantmodi Yep. Don't overcomplicate.
1485968682811637762 2022-01-25 13:31:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GraemeCrawley_ Incredibly amazing (and more descriptors)
1485968627207655426 2022-01-25 13:31:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @workonworkoff Look up the PASTOR model of copywriting. Works wonders.
1485968560316948492 2022-01-25 13:31:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickens_greg Oh, heck yeah. I'd prefer someone tried, learned, and tried again vs. never trying at all.
1485968480591568911 2022-01-25 13:31:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jeffrey_Funk Morning Jeff. Love the way you put that.
1485968432428462088 2022-01-25 13:30:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotechAna SO true, Ana.
1485965477591539714 2022-01-25 13:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A mistake I see solopreneurs making:  Selling products for problems they haven't validated.  - No real problem - No real urgency - No real pain  Remember that pain is an indicator of purchase.  "Nice to have" doesn't sell much.
1485676994826223616 2022-01-24 18:12:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DerekSelinger Working out and building businesses have so many great similarities.
1485675238033707016 2022-01-24 18:05:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Aniketmlive 4 hours per day, 5 days per week.   Get more done by focusing on things that matter.
1485674536288899087 2022-01-24 18:03:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I never hustle 24/7.  But I do hustle 4/5.  Solopreneurship is about bursts. Not burnout.
1485629120448970755 2022-01-24 15:02:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @o0Aditi0o 😂
1485608331473530888 2022-01-24 13:40:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pheadrick Tryin'!
1485608306509025282 2022-01-24 13:39:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattsimondesign That's the ticket right there.
1485608239559593989 2022-01-24 13:39:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach Haha. Nah.
1485608217090695170 2022-01-24 13:39:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @workonworkoff I think teaching is the best way to start, yes.
1485608156281589765 2022-01-24 13:39:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @keyurkumbhare Basically. But even boring value gets skipped.
1485608113709494272 2022-01-24 13:39:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ayushtweetshere Nice, Ayush. Great list.
1485608084248702981 2022-01-24 13:39:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Yep. But often people need value defined for them.
1485604832669061125 2022-01-24 13:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 types of content builds a following:  1. This person teaches me 2. This person entertains me 3. This person makes me think 4. This person understands me  That's about it.

1485259010114740227 2022-01-23 14:31:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrandonArvay Thanks, Brandon!
1485258598712283139 2022-01-23 14:30:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daniel_ndukwu As is yours!
1485255300735279116 2022-01-23 14:17:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @daniel_ndukwu Sure. But if you only seek validation rather than being open to the idea you're wrong occasionally, it can be a real trap.  And most people who seek validation can usually find it. Right or wrong.
1485254206797848576 2022-01-23 14:12:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 99% of people wake up with the same goal:   Further validating what they already believe.  Instead, open your mind.  You'll listen more. You'll grow as a person. You'll build a better business.

1484944513932083205 2022-01-22 17:42:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theAdamUpchurch 100% you will be.  Help people make money or save money and you'll be right there with them.
1484944391139639296 2022-01-22 17:41:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD It's amazing how this will:  - improve your life - build your audience - help your business succeed
1484944281295065088 2022-01-22 17:41:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith You need to know nothing else except that. If you just do that? You'll likely win.
1484934656206196747 2022-01-22 17:03:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My best advice for succeeding as a solopreneur:  "Lift others to lift yourself."  Almost fail-proof.
1484910997827633156 2022-01-22 15:29:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ncb000gt Yeah, that's definitely likely.  I know being a bit more isolated has led to significantly more anxiety on my side.
1484907535509475333 2022-01-22 15:15:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ncb000gt I’m sure COVID hasn’t helped but people have been burning out long before COVID.
1484899258478252032 2022-01-22 14:42:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotechAna Extremely well articulated. Thanks for this, Ana.
1484896964097585167 2022-01-22 14:33:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jabuto_Jabuto Have you identified the cause?
1484895479901081603 2022-01-22 14:27:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons It's all a balance.
1484894393932959752 2022-01-22 14:23:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A lot of people I know are burning out.  Hustling in an imaginary competition with peers.  What's the point of winning a game you hate playing?
1484587118655639554 2022-01-21 18:02:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurs goals should start with lifestyle, not money.  Filthy rich and burned out sucks.   Moderately wealthy and free is heaven.
1484519656664743940 2022-01-21 13:34:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jeffrey_Funk Community is important and extremely difficult to get right.
1484518926189043722 2022-01-21 13:31:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jumpshipdev It means bringing your fans somewhere outside of social media, where you can control the narrative and there is no algorithm. Such as a community.
1484518796870262788 2022-01-21 13:30:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @linkedin_king I'll likely write about it here soon.
1484518720659673093 2022-01-21 13:30:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ReprogramCoach Exactly. I need to heed my own advice here.
1484518676405571585 2022-01-21 13:30:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Love that graphic, Max.
1484517441501908994 2022-01-21 13:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The future of solopreneurship:  - off-platform - skill stacking - community first - outsource heavy - experiment laden - partnership dependent - focused on time vs. money - daily progress vs. perfection - built with a lifestyle first mindset
1484348740781568000 2022-01-21 02:14:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @realAndyPaul @WillAllred117 It's all you, brother. 🙌
1484343358491279364 2022-01-21 01:53:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WillAllred117 Extremely cool. This is a great breakdown.
1484341069902843906 2022-01-21 01:44:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WillAllred117 Ahh. Misunderstood. I was thinking purely from a dollar per impression perspective.
1484334623970656266 2022-01-21 01:18:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WillAllred117 I think it's probably close to half that. I'll do 60M views and it will do around $1M.
1484313214858915842 2022-01-20 23:53:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisRocas Publish what you're learning and other people who are 2-3 years behind you will find you extremely valuable.
1484313035032436736 2022-01-20 23:52:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GrowBara Thin skin. The #1 dream killer.
1484311893535649792 2022-01-20 23:48:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @seempaq That video will live forever and probably land you a customer 6 months from now. That's what I love.
1484311798417600512 2022-01-20 23:48:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackhilbrich Yep. It's really about the aggregate total of your thoughts being available.  I get leads and customers from stuff I put out 2 years ago. It's wild.
1484311039411998721 2022-01-20 23:45:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CompundLearner We all have quality thoughts each day.   It’s really about systematizing the process of getting them out rather than “I’m about to sit down and try to write”
1484310294222360583 2022-01-20 23:42:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most solopreneurs misunderstand content.  It's not about daily virality attempts.  It's about having thousands of your thoughts in the ecosystem at any moment in time.  1000+ pieces working hard on your behalf.  So, publish frequently.   Because you never know what resonates.

1484159496746319873 2022-01-20 13:42:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenpratley True story, Stephen. 🙌
1484156217241092106 2022-01-20 13:29:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ajones55555 I never build or create anything without validating that people will actually pay for it first.
1484154632205213699 2022-01-20 13:23:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eduardidn1 Gm.
1484154606821249034 2022-01-20 13:23:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hq_storage Yep. Couldn't have said it better myself.
1484154558792282114 2022-01-20 13:23:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Definitely. Is better to test than to go all-in, only to discover nobody is interested.
1483943634831556621 2022-01-19 23:25:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk - Transparency about it - Focus on the 20% that matters - Delegate the 80% effectively
1483942680715534338 2022-01-19 23:21:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond Amazing how rates soar when you find a niche and learn it’s inner workings.
1483939873023315968 2022-01-19 23:10:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD Same thing I tell people all of the time.  Start with a service business and move to productize. Love that.
1483939583142334465 2022-01-19 23:09:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisRocas Yep. Also, people forget that impostor syndrome means your doing something good.  I've never met a mediocre person with impostor syndrome.
1483939329709948928 2022-01-19 23:08:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyblake The pain and problems are all discovered during the conversations.  Technical pain → historical pain → financial pain → personal pain  Get to personal and win.
1483938690628005890 2022-01-19 23:05:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to earn a living online:  - Build trust through high-quality content. - Talk to people about their problems. - Create a simple solution for them. - Make it really easy to buy. - Deliver results.  Simplicity &gt; complexity
1483930670825148419 2022-01-19 22:33:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CoreyWilksPsyD @EricJorgenson It's definitely the sandwiches.  This is a thing of beauty. Please never say no to them.  https://t.co/8bpKckgPwH
1483867415821930496 2022-01-19 18:22:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nick_lisauskas Everyone feels uncomfortable.  Might I suggest that you start by focusing only on what you want to be known for?  Over time, you can add back in personal things, but in the beginning, people follow for value.
1483864170177118210 2022-01-19 18:09:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itstravisdavis A service business like coaching or consulting is easiest.  Then take what you learn, package it into a digital product, and sell that.  And raise your rates on the service side.
1483851434357628930 2022-01-19 17:18:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcgary_ben Absolutely. Just reminding myself!
1483851434345041925 2022-01-19 17:18:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen @dvassallo @dickiebush Thanks, Dennis!
1483849973804453888 2022-01-19 17:12:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Raicheen_B I absolutely love that, Raicheen.
1483849973758373894 2022-01-19 17:12:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CostelloBrennan @ManagingPlaybk Exactly why I blocked almost all politics. Distractions.
1483848589906427904 2022-01-19 17:07:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManagingPlaybk Which side do you mean?
1483848542825463808 2022-01-19 17:07:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_shanicesj Yep. But having impostor syndrome at least means you're doing something big.
1483847252342943746 2022-01-19 17:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The knowledge you take for granted could be life-changing for someone else.  You owe it to the world to hit "publish".
1483825826814648320 2022-01-19 15:36:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GoLimitless Love this. Thank you 🔥
1483796252068360194 2022-01-19 13:39:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OfferMafia That I did not know. Interesting...
1483796175371259908 2022-01-19 13:39:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @workonworkoff People feel most comfortable when they can pass their bad habits to you.
1483796100133883912 2022-01-19 13:38:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks Exactly. Or no to your family and loved ones.
1483796036787347457 2022-01-19 13:38:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @conquergrowth I back this statement 100% ☝🏻
1483792787225071619 2022-01-19 13:25:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheKushagra25 Always. Time is your biggest asset.
1483792130611032069 2022-01-19 13:23:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Time mangement tip for solopreneurs:  It's better to say no to distractions than be the person everyone likes.
1483767370376265728 2022-01-19 11:44:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Exactly, Josh. Create for the "you" from 2-3 years ago.
1483586970706190337 2022-01-18 23:47:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pgpreston Everyone. It's such a simple thing to do.  Apparently, it's also simple to skip.
1483554281848463364 2022-01-18 21:37:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @60thMeridian @ramit  https://t.co/XOMVTRuf1P
1483523985233096709 2022-01-18 19:37:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaxx_sam That's the exact question.   And the more you learn, the more you realize you can do this step-by-step.   By the time you leave your job, you're ready with a proven business.
1483495426242359303 2022-01-18 17:44:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tell people you hate your job and nobody bats an eye.  Tell people you're going to become a solopreneur and get a lecture on risk.  Wild.

1483453586076012553 2022-01-18 14:57:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Camp4 @girdley I was part of the labor force for 16 years, then became an entrepreneur.  It's not one or the other.
1483434514479292430 2022-01-18 13:42:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ale_bizpln Oh amazing! I'm so glad to hear that, Alejandro. Thanks for sharing.
1483434350456807426 2022-01-18 13:41:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness @ModernEremite And it's been awesome to watch. It's resonating because people want behind-the-scenes looks.
1483431683563085835 2022-01-18 13:30:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theyashjha That's the best way to approach it, Yash.
1483431608963239941 2022-01-18 13:30:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ConsultantBig4 That's what I've found. It's been instrumental in growing my network.
1483431542810726403 2022-01-18 13:30:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stnkvcs Keep it going, Mantas. 🙌
1483431459532718080 2022-01-18 13:29:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @atul31gupta No, I don't think so at all.  And it's not "shouting about every small thing you learn".   Like doing anything well, you'll need a strategy and to execute rather well.
1483429511207264263 2022-01-18 13:22:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_IlirAliu Thanks so much, Ilir!
1483429469201256458 2022-01-18 13:22:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Denis__Shatalin Exactly. Share out loud.
1483429322882957317 2022-01-18 13:21:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OfferMafia Smart. It's worth it.
1483429267010732035 2022-01-18 13:21:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ModernEremite Learn to write effective copy, then share what you're learning. A small subset of the world will find you interesting.  And that's all that matters...
1483429136790175747 2022-01-18 13:20:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Same here, Mike. It's only once I started that I learned the power.
1483428735848263682 2022-01-18 13:19:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're learning &amp; growing in private, but not sharing it here?  You're missing an opportunity to find your people.
1483223820408430599 2022-01-17 23:44:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonbrosio Nailed it.  Busy can feel like growth. That's the trick everyone needs to recognize and avoid.
1483147106810540036 2022-01-17 18:40:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @girdley @andrewglynch That makes sense.   I've always considered myself risk-averse but my definition of risk has changed over time as I surrounded myself with different people.   That shift allowed me to view trying entrepreneurship as less risky than never trying.  Good conversation 🙌🏻
1483144550558351367 2022-01-17 18:29:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewglynch @girdley Now that I wholeheartedly agree with 🙌🏻  Some people just don't have the interest.
1483142658273030152 2022-01-17 18:22:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewglynch @girdley Sorry, but that still doesn't mean they aren't wired for it.  You're just describing me 5 years ago when I simply wasn't ready.   Turns out I was "wired for it" after all.
1483139722339880969 2022-01-17 18:10:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewglynch @girdley Not everyone needs to be one, but I don't agree that people "aren't wired" for it.
1483139463840739331 2022-01-17 18:09:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @girdley I think most people won't become solopreneurs or entrepreneurs.  That, IMO, doesn't mean they aren't wired for it.  I think it all depends on whether or not they end up in an environment that helps them think differently and discover more options.
1483138418695618563 2022-01-17 18:05:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BriTheWebGuy Way less.
1483137830813589508 2022-01-17 18:03:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is hard. Shitty jobs are harder.
1483133017346428938 2022-01-17 17:44:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @codebeef_ Different for everyone.  For me, it's about creating more systems, building new products, and generating high-quality content.
1483132870201954308 2022-01-17 17:43:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @geoff_byron @alexwestco OKRs for the most part.  If something doesn't tie directly to my OKRs, I'm getting pretty good at ignoring it.
1483113421977575425 2022-01-17 16:26:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kyle_Byers @jmcmillen89 - Building systems. - Building new information products. - Creating high-quality evergreen content.
1483112121558786049 2022-01-17 16:20:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DuaneDufault @carrd @ConvertKit @usefathom @gumroad @outseta @zapier @Kajabi @HubSpot I'm moving to Kajabi right now.
1483111422284505088 2022-01-17 16:18:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 This Tweet was a perfect example of me writing at myself.   I feel you. 2020 was my struggle year of being unfocused. Got a little better in 2021.
1483082806469271557 2022-01-17 14:24:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dovhyi How true that is...
1483077487597080576 2022-01-17 14:03:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nickneral Thank you, Nick!

1483070361340194823 2022-01-17 13:35:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexwestco Yep.  Shiny object syndrome is my kryptonite.
1483069471082303492 2022-01-17 13:31:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManagingPlaybk Yep.   - Goals - Check-in points - Tactical action steps
1483069382074974212 2022-01-17 13:31:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @juliemichellemo Step back and look at what truly moves the needle.  Often, we already know stuff we waste time on that feels like productivity. It's just about asking ourselves the right questions and then having the discipline to stick to the big movers.
1483069107712966662 2022-01-17 13:30:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylegawley Makes sense. Feels like sharing a lot of that could be a great way to market in combination with outsourcing.  Best of luck, Kyle!
1483068112471838725 2022-01-17 13:26:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most solopreneurs would grow faster if they only focused on the 20% of plays that move the needle.
1483063052861939720 2022-01-17 13:06:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylegawley Outsourcing something doesn't really mean you're not a solopreneuer (and labels don't really matter anyways).   Curious as to why marketing?

1482788771812753414 2022-01-16 18:56:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Reminder to all solopreneurs:  Something very obvious to you is worth a lot of money to someone else.  Have a great Sunday.

1482514956985806854 2022-01-16 00:48:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulElijas Mostly low-cost sales.  Overall ARPU (average revenue per user) is about $77.   Last 4 months, ARPU has been $116 though.
1482514570157735938 2022-01-16 00:46:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcgillmd921 Yep. You can just check their website for guides, help, and instructions.
1482495893005819904 2022-01-15 23:32:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mike_winnet Would love to. Let's grab a time in DM.
1482495676563038209 2022-01-15 23:31:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcgillmd921 Same. Gumroad is all-in-one.

1482421368197111811 2022-01-15 18:36:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jennykaypollock @sankalpdomore @dvassallo Find 3-5 people in your industry/market who have a ton of followers and play underneath their content. You can grow just doing that.
1482420739361984513 2022-01-15 18:33:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jennykaypollock @ale_bizpln Honestly it’s the simple:  Choose a specific topic Learn effective copywriting Write about it daily  I never play for the algorithm. I just assume good content bubbles up.
1482384911499681794 2022-01-15 16:11:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkModesti @stevemarkperry I'm not sure about years of experience to be successful. That's awfully tough to measure, but likely no more or less than the years put in to be successful in most careers.  In terms of hours, I spend about 1-2 hours per day on LinkedIn/Twitter.
1482363704062713859 2022-01-15 14:47:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabe_llewellyn 100%, Gabe. So much lack of clarity around message...kills people's business.
1482363558067384321 2022-01-15 14:46:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mahdisaghafii Networking could be a thread highlighting other creators.  Attention could be shining a light on the problem your audience faces.  Revenue could be asking people to purchase your course or service.
1482363366471577600 2022-01-15 14:45:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamvikeshtiwari Basically, Vikesh.

1482360011938533380 2022-01-15 14:32:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mauro_codes A good example is a thread that highlights other creators.
1482355954352074753 2022-01-15 14:16:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Excellent thread, Dickie.  A masterclass in writing.
1482352987842490372 2022-01-15 14:04:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KristjanZemljic I like Cashvertising for copywriting.  I like  https://t.co/ZVbx6xdGPr for all things marketing.
1482352792983552005 2022-01-15 14:03:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vvilltaylor Build the network and get the attention first. I plan on doing that for 12 months here before I ever ask for anything.
1482346855677808650 2022-01-15 13:40:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AASipos Multiple short videos and a few downloadable resources made in Gdrive.   Nothing fancy at all. Not even a fancy webcam.
1482346675935064070 2022-01-15 13:39:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheFalanBlake Gave them without asking any questions usually.
1482346583186362373 2022-01-15 13:39:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JimCanto @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn I have almost none. $70 per month for  https://t.co/DNeY0WF8u7, 2.9% for Gumroad and $19 a year for Carrd.
1482346132801994758 2022-01-15 13:37:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zetareticoli I address the most common questions people ask me.
1482345907073036295 2022-01-15 13:36:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AASipos Video lessons. I chose it bc it’s how I like to learn.
1482345785475874823 2022-01-15 13:35:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @raouf Gumroad for hosting. I just do one off purchases.
1482345507049639937 2022-01-15 13:34:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mhmd_azeez Either promotions/sales like Black Friday/Cyber Monday, or product launches.
1482193103721320448 2022-01-15 03:29:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichePriest This is awesome. Nice work. 🙌🏻
1482140739530285059 2022-01-15 00:01:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itstravisdavis Here's what I'd recommend:  Use @gumroad. It's easy, affordable, and exactly what you need to get started. I promise.
1482138856166150144 2022-01-14 23:53:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LongchainChris I've personally responded to more than 75,000 questions on LinkedIn over the last 2.5 years.
1482138181743087618 2022-01-14 23:50:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itstravisdavis No. They have way too many fields to convert well.  I just use Gumroad and pipe people into Teachable using Zapier for a better student experience.
1482137855170387974 2022-01-14 23:49:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen LinkedIn organic posting for me.
1482137830331719683 2022-01-14 23:49:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ricardorubin77 Thanks, Ricardo!
1482137730700255234 2022-01-14 23:49:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FerraroOnAir Talk about the benefits of asking better questions every single day online. Every post.
1482137590358810634 2022-01-14 23:48:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @The_MMW @ecomchasedimond Thank you, Fiona!
1482137528324997123 2022-01-14 23:48:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mmartin_joo I feature the course on my LinkedIn featured section and I do about 120k impressions daily on my content. That just drives consistent purchases.
1482137239350128640 2022-01-14 23:47:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hapsize @dvassallo Haha. It's Teachable the hosting platform 😂
1482137132277903361 2022-01-14 23:46:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx Thanks, dude!
1482136995375812611 2022-01-14 23:46:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stevemarkperry $19/yr for the Carrd website, 2.9% for Gumroad, and $70/mo for  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I which I use for testimonials.  I'm sure there are some other small costs in there (Zapier, etc.) but all-in-all, less than $3k.   I don't do any advertising at all, so no marketing costs.
1482136201490542595 2022-01-14 23:43:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @axforya The honest answer is I've just never spent the time to learn about ads or talk to anyone about them.  I'm not against them, just haven't ever made the time.  I'm sure they are worth looking into. Maybe I will in 2022!
1482135417851990019 2022-01-14 23:39:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ale_bizpln Literally just posting stuff about the same topics, people found it organically.
1482128343831134211 2022-01-14 23:11:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @autotrader87 @noahkagan @GrammarHippy @sweatystartup @ShaanVP @theSamParr @dklineii @alexgarcia_atx Thanks, Bastian!
1482070183003009026 2022-01-14 19:20:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mohitpawar Definitely less now.  I work probably 40 hours per week on my business, like most people.   It's just really enjoyable.
1482070032842735616 2022-01-14 19:20:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @giordano_ Sure. Just wrote every day for 2.5+ years and gained a really big following. That's basically it
1482069760485609478 2022-01-14 19:19:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @landforce Here’s a good one:   https://t.co/ORT7Y4VqpF  Shit is delicious.
1482068601855266822 2022-01-14 19:14:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 We’re due a chat anyways. Let’s catch up. I’ll DM ya
1482068330546667520 2022-01-14 19:13:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ijinal @dvassallo Just used Loom and Google slides. I keep everything simple.
1482065628076908544 2022-01-14 19:02:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KPwagner Correct. Course launches and big promotions.  For example, the last big spike you see is a Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale.
1482065366532644865 2022-01-14 19:01:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itschriskeith Launches and promotions mostly.  I don't really talk about it on Twitter because I'm just growing here and not focused on making any money.
1482065185716285444 2022-01-14 19:00:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Visits to my LinkedIn profile which leads to the CTA in my featured section.   1000 profile views per day leads to about 18 sales per day. I don't have it all perfectly set up.   I'm working on analytics this year.
1482064821562576897 2022-01-14 18:59:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JRoss96 I do coaching, yes, but try not to do too much.  I don't want to spend a lot of time in meetings.
1482064723260674048 2022-01-14 18:59:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AugMaximus I have a few other ideas that I'll test in 2022.  I also advise SaaS companies, angel invest, run a private community, do a little coaching, I'm part of an accelerator, etc. Lots of rev streams.
1482064189342560261 2022-01-14 18:56:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IamAndrewEllis Usually between 21-30 days. About 1-2 hours per day
1482058987751231493 2022-01-14 18:36:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @john_mackonen Consultancy is tougher to scale because you need more time. But you could always build a team of consultants and deliver them into accounts to scale.
1482058669042900999 2022-01-14 18:34:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheAnkurTyagi Jot your wins/losses/learnings down each day. Then share them.  Sharing your story in public as it relates to what you're working on is great marketing.
1482058496585646093 2022-01-14 18:34:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Julienleg @theandreboso It is. But that's part of my LinkedIn strategy. I treat it like Twitter.
1482058421855784964 2022-01-14 18:33:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StrategyTime21 I started by talking about SaaS sales because that's what I was doing with my life. Over time, I just listened to what my audience most commonly asked for.  Now I talk about social growth and solopreneurship.
1482058223838543889 2022-01-14 18:33:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @slanoue 2x per day usually. The strategy is to continue entertaining and educating for the most part.
1482057741036359683 2022-01-14 18:31:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichePriest @SeanAnthonySays Yeah, I'm trying my best to stay away from time for money and turn everything into automation.  But I love the idea.
1482052325476913157 2022-01-14 18:09:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinNeravath This is awesome! I'm going to look into this. Thank you.
1482052095998152705 2022-01-14 18:08:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theciaranmarket I appreciate it, Ciaran!
1482051903462821894 2022-01-14 18:08:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MemeCodeMoney Haha. I have no idea what this means, but I love it.
1482051547181760512 2022-01-14 18:06:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays Not sure, to be honest. I like high-upside, low-effort stuff.   My whole focus in scaling lifestyle vs. scaling earnings. Ya know?  Got an idea for me? :)
1482051407196872705 2022-01-14 18:06:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Adi_t2021 I don't ever DM. Just create content.
1482051340595613699 2022-01-14 18:05:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichePriest @madsbrodt I write 1.5 hours on Monday and 1 hour per day on other days.
1482050840601018370 2022-01-14 18:03:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Balana26409803 Only my own.
1482050803351359493 2022-01-14 18:03:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JohnInscoe I talk about the same topic on LinkedIn every single day and generate nearly all my leads through LinkedIn.
1482050737098141713 2022-01-14 18:03:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IamAmanKhatri Here's just one example:    https://t.co/fXZRhfzvZi
1482050523926827011 2022-01-14 18:02:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edwindijkstra Ga er achteraan!
1482050399985090560 2022-01-14 18:02:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Roy_Bntz My one suggestion might be tightening up your social accounts. There's a lot of political stuff and other things there. If you stayed focused on continuously providing useful content around starting a podcast, you'd for sure get more buyers.
1482049554446958605 2022-01-14 17:58:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @catalinmpit Thank you so much, I appreciate it!
1482049202284859395 2022-01-14 17:57:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Roy_Bntz Where are you currently promoting it?
1482048909983764481 2022-01-14 17:56:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @mistamor Beautiful!
1482048320445026312 2022-01-14 17:53:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VicVijayakumar So far, it's off to a hot start. Who knows how it will continue.
1482048147186761729 2022-01-14 17:53:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichePriest @dvassallo I'd love to know unsubs and also learn more about individual and collective behavior on CTAs.   Basically, it would be helpful to understand "superfans" for lack of a better term.
1482047165094576135 2022-01-14 17:49:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gumroad @IamAmanKhatri @dvassallo Amazing! Can't wait for that.
1482047055728189443 2022-01-14 17:48:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo I'd love to see a few things:  - More flexible landing page options - Purchase power parity - More robust email analytics  Outside of those things, Gumroad is magnificent.
1482046836009574403 2022-01-14 17:47:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vincenthaywood Simple:  LinkedIn for audience Carrd for my landing page Gumroad for eCommerce  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I for testimonials
1482046664034729984 2022-01-14 17:47:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor @dvassallo That's why I build landing pages on Carrd.
1482046498695168004 2022-01-14 17:46:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 That's a great question. I don't actually have a "24/7 funnel" in the typical fashion (email automation).  If I were to make an educated guess, I'd say 30% of my sales come from sale events, and the other 70% come from regular visits.
1482046017738522625 2022-01-14 17:44:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vincenthaywood It's about 20 videos, all very short, between 3-6 minutes.
1482045680931778567 2022-01-14 17:43:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edwindijkstra Without much context, it's hard to say, but you could build in your native language to learn about the process and collect a bunch of feedback.  Then, go global?
1482045242501222400 2022-01-14 17:41:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Adi_t2021 LinkedIn.
1482044220542230530 2022-01-14 17:37:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImtiazAli_1 @theandreboso There are lots of people selling on Twitter, but very few on LinkedIn.  It's just more wide open.
1482043946654179333 2022-01-14 17:36:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rudolfcicko2 I only market it organically.  I haven't ever spent money (just time) marketing it in any way.  Is that what you were asking?
1482043725568163840 2022-01-14 17:35:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinNeravath I would love to offer it.  Gumroad doesn't offer it now, which kinda stinks.
1482043566356639744 2022-01-14 17:34:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @madsbrodt Thank you, Mads!
1482043524300353537 2022-01-14 17:34:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcisdebaas  https://t.co/zcVWLfNPoa
1482043308104953861 2022-01-14 17:33:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @k_quirapas It had videos and resources.  I don't know much about piracy, nor do I care.
1482043112872718340 2022-01-14 17:33:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rajkbnp @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn @Twitter I never mention my course or sell anything here.
1482040596034469891 2022-01-14 17:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn I don't use anything like that.  I just use Carrd and Gumroad.
1482040011981737992 2022-01-14 17:20:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @craiginzana The shortest was 60. The longest was 3.5 hours.   The shorter, the better I've learned.
1482039877827014658 2022-01-14 17:20:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SainiRahul_ Start sharing experiences in an industry/with a skillset you have knowledge in. See who you attract.
1482039521579524100 2022-01-14 17:18:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SunnyConsults 35% to make it worthwhile
1482039414448664576 2022-01-14 17:18:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness I keep them short now!
1482039325839790085 2022-01-14 17:18:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yosifux I was never interested, honestly. I probably could, I just don't know anything about it, and haven't ever spent the time.  I wish I had a better answer than that.
1482039190095290375 2022-01-14 17:17:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheKushagra25 Focus on one very specific thing and become well known for it.
1482039116992819206 2022-01-14 17:17:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SunnyConsults I built a small following on LinkedIn first. Then went to market.  Always build an audience first, IMO.
1482039011556446214 2022-01-14 17:16:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness First course was 60% Second was only 35% (too long!) Current is 55%
1482038899690164226 2022-01-14 17:16:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack I just compiled all of the questions I was most commonly asked by people. That's the easiest way.
1482038752558166019 2022-01-14 17:15:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theandreboso LinkedIn.  Twitter is very noisy, while LinkedIn is wide open.
1482038663689166853 2022-01-14 17:15:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FariqNazir - My daily life - Things I'm asked by other people - Perusing Twitter and other places for inspiration
1482038496399405057 2022-01-14 17:14:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eichel_af I have 2 that are currently active:  - One teaches you how to use LinkedIn more meaningfully - The second one teaches you the systems and processes for setting up your first online service and product business
1482038259773583361 2022-01-14 17:13:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @madciapka LinkedIn and my email list only.
1482038197001637888 2022-01-14 17:13:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @madsbrodt I wrote for about 8 months before monetizing. I was at 21k followers on LinkedIn. Now I'm around 151k
1482038007515566081 2022-01-14 17:12:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FariqNazir Probably the same way.   I guess I don't really know a different way. I think I would have grown on Twitter simultaneously, but that's why I'm here now.
1482037862900060163 2022-01-14 17:12:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jkostecki_rei @SullyBusiness My largest affiliate has done 19 sales. In total, I've only sold 8k through affiliates.
1482037621253623808 2022-01-14 17:11:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austencam I had 20k followers on LinkedIn when I launched and a few thousand here on Twitter (but inactive).  Each course took about 21 days to build. Maybe 30-90 hours depending on which one.
1482037313043587076 2022-01-14 17:10:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kellen_the_man The very first time I made a sale and hearing student wins (much like your win!)
1482037201047375878 2022-01-14 17:09:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jthomas__ My thought is to price it how I would feel most comfortable buying it.  My first course was $50. My second course was $99. My third course is currently $150.  I've found lower prices and larger quantities of students means more word-of-mouth.
1482036957278519304 2022-01-14 17:08:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @springertimo I don't think there's a "right" answer to that question.  I built my first course after receiving the same questions over and over again in my DM inbox.  To me, it's more about signals than sheer numbers.
1482036720694611973 2022-01-14 17:07:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_IlirAliu @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn No, that's built on @Ghost
1482036518491410434 2022-01-14 17:06:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kyle_Byers @carrd @gumroad @LinkedIn Yes.  LinkedIn followed by my email list.
1482036455820173318 2022-01-14 17:06:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austencam I started with a $50 short video course that packed a punch. It was affordable so 1,500 people bought it, got a 100x return, and I built a ton of trust.
1482036193223221248 2022-01-14 17:05:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsKieranDrew Thanks so much, Kieran.
1482035809293381637 2022-01-14 17:04:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Note: Compounding is real and it shows.  Special thanks to:  - @Carrd for landing pages - @Gumroad for eCommerce - @LinkedIn for massive distribution
1482035574152347653 2022-01-14 17:03:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> After 22 months, I crossed $500k in course sales.  - 12 months to make the first $100k - 10 months to make another $400k  All without running a single advertisement.  Ask me anything.   There's plenty I don't know, but I can give you my perspective 👇  https://t.co/ydMjdP7Lpd
1482001955081830402 2022-01-14 14:49:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JAPozueloM Same here. Basically writing "at myself." 😂
1481988671888838660 2022-01-14 13:56:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DiegoPinedaVL Wow, I love this. Thanks for sharing this quote, Diego.
1481984091759255557 2022-01-14 13:38:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt @JamesClear I've always loved this, Danny.
1481981225648721924 2022-01-14 13:27:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ADobrzhansky @dylangallagher I think you learn the best lessons when you don’t avoid them tbh.
1481980699964026882 2022-01-14 13:25:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is about managing emotions.  - Don't get amped by $5k days. - Don't get depressed by $0 days.  Slow and steady, 1% better each day.
1481784718932721672 2022-01-14 00:26:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shawn__Graham @ecomchasedimond Glad you enjoyed it, Shawn.  Glad to see you on here as well. Cheers.
1481777940136398855 2022-01-13 23:59:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jumpshipdev What an awesome compliment. Thank you 💪
1481775984647065602 2022-01-13 23:51:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DustinRoman Thank you, my man. I appreciate that.
1481775030556102664 2022-01-13 23:47:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons  https://t.co/zsvUqCwbUp
1481774436441378816 2022-01-13 23:45:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Appreciate you, Ali 💪
1481773580379639817 2022-01-13 23:42:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is hard.  - Block shitty people - Ignore habitual nitpickers - Don't aim to be liked by everyone  Find your people, support one another, and press go.
1481760762997710853 2022-01-13 22:51:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecomchasedimond Thanks so much for the great conversation, Chase. Cheers bud.
1481675961477341189 2022-01-13 17:14:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sladeerickson Be a sponge, and then apply a lot of what you learn. Figure out the intersection between advice you've received and what works for your situation.
1481674688946397189 2022-01-13 17:09:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JesseGerniginAC Extremely misleading.
1481674634558849026 2022-01-13 17:08:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandonkindred To me, it's about pushing the ball forward an inch each day.
1481674549154529281 2022-01-13 17:08:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_serajuddin Learn to learn, and you'll be much better off.
1481672913719857157 2022-01-13 17:02:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The less predictable your career, the less helpful "how-to" advice is.   Becoming a doctor has a pretty straight-line path.  Becoming a solopreneur doesn't.  Don't blindly follow someone else's advice only to find out their luck isn't on your side.
1481631534666985477 2022-01-13 14:17:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @apetechda Appreciate it, Alex.

1481617046039371779 2022-01-13 13:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneur sales tip:  When pitching your product, turn data into stories first.  Stories hook.  Data supports.

1481434957868265473 2022-01-13 01:16:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianSexton13 I think MBAs are great. I'm sure there are numerous benefits I'm unaware of.  I think most are likely overpriced. $150k payment when you could get paid $150k to wear 10 hats at a great startup company.  Just my 2 cents. I'm wrong a lot.
1481426089717207041 2022-01-13 00:41:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cyprianfrancis Congrats!

1481416954606927873 2022-01-13 00:05:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bmceuen Not too shabby of an idea.  Kellogg School was always my dream. I just wasn't theirs. 😂
1481414305300066305 2022-01-12 23:54:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rparnow I'm sure the MBA experience is a great one. I've worked with MBA folks who come in a do great work.  I've also worked with MBA guys who come in with that "I've got an MBA" attitude.  I'm sure you've seen both too.
1481382369554837507 2022-01-12 21:47:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor @Nick_Franklin I did. It was manual. This looks really cool.

1481342394578751494 2022-01-12 19:08:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harrydry Amazing. Congrats, Harry!
1481341407415656463 2022-01-12 19:04:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kaleighf I launched a digital course and community business that's pacing 7-figures. Happy to chat.
1481316876055715846 2022-01-12 17:27:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach It's actually really, really good. I rewatched it the other day and enjoyed it even more the second time.
1481313844240785410 2022-01-12 17:15:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_serajuddin That's the kicker in all of this...
1481312864883331074 2022-01-12 17:11:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ayushtweetshere Great tweet. You nailed it.
1481310611715891201 2022-01-12 17:02:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurs don't need viral content.  Marketing is about getting on base every day.  - Familiar name - Familiar face - Familiar topic - Familiar content  It's cliche as hell but play Moneyball.
1481262910945042442 2022-01-12 13:52:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmasCreates I assume at least a mild level of competence when I write.
1481262571244167178 2022-01-12 13:51:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @juliemichellemo Always. FITI  F: feedback I: iterate T: testimonials I: increase price
1481262410736541702 2022-01-12 13:50:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevLinguistic Sure sounds like it.
1481256444028755969 2022-01-12 13:27:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @oriolmogas I'm sure there are skills you've developed at your job that you could lean on with the same formula.
1481255867400048645 2022-01-12 13:24:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Side hustles come before solopreneurship.  Here's an easy way to start your first one:  1. Take whatever thing you do at your work 2. Talk about that thing every day online 3. Find people who need that thing 4. Do that thing for them too  Congrats. You have a side hustle.
1481068360397996033 2022-01-12 00:59:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matthew_Fenton Exactly. When I feel worried, I remember this specifically.
1481068242240212992 2022-01-12 00:59:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Andyyk0 I think it's the best way to start. No pressure, and plenty of time to experiment for 30-60 minutes per day.
1481068086665093121 2022-01-12 00:58:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abhishekshah173 I feel like it's about building deeper relationships with the right people. Just my take though.
1481054704956289028 2022-01-12 00:05:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @miloshjokic 100% agree. That’s why I took it in the first place.
1481054615684718592 2022-01-12 00:05:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @madsbrodt Amen. I hear that.
1481054562068873217 2022-01-12 00:04:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @noahedelman2 Great point.
1481054505714212865 2022-01-12 00:04:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisSamp1 I think so too. Plus, I’ve made so many valuable connections.
1481054426618077185 2022-01-12 00:04:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heychazza Exactly. What are the chances you can’t find a job in a few months? Probably slim.
1481049157737537546 2022-01-11 23:43:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Something I ask myself every day:  "What if I fail as a solopreneur?"  The worst outcome is I go back to work. The best outcome is the exact life I want to design.  Decent downside. Massive upside.   Remind yourself of your optionality daily.
1481040378308530180 2022-01-11 23:08:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro Here's a great read. I trained underneath the guy who is featured in this article (GuruGanesha Khalsa).   https://t.co/T0fzAS4sO5
1481038320813674496 2022-01-11 23:00:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro I mean that prospects are unlikely to act unless you can move them from thinking about the pain/problem as a nuisance to more of a "must fix now".   You do this through amplification.  Technical → Monetary → Personal
1481025057824649219 2022-01-11 22:07:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joe_portsmouth Excellent recap and you nailed it. Focus is where it's at.
1481017337683787776 2022-01-11 21:37:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GrowBara Great question.   I think “everyone else” can be misleading. We exist in a vacuum on Twitter and most of us follow the same folks.   The customers you acquire will likely find your message refreshing vs. boring bc they don’t know “everyone else” exists.
1481000963095900163 2022-01-11 20:31:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImtiazAli_1 1. It’s important to understand exactly who you help, why you help them, what you help them do, and what your differentiator is from other people.  2. I haven’t written much about that, no.
1480997781552742403 2022-01-11 20:19:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kendall_Bachman Just diversification. Who knows how platforms will change over time.  Plus, I really love Twitter. It's great for networking with smart people.
1480960903570853888 2022-01-11 17:52:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jthomas__ Really appreciate it, Jake. Good luck out there 🙌
1480960902702710784 2022-01-11 17:52:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jthomas__ Really appreciate it, Jake. Good luck out there 🙌
1480955714789167107 2022-01-11 17:32:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks Exactly. Then learn about why they did that, adjust as needed. Repeat.  BTW - just booked a trip to Lisbon. You live there?
1480954973726859270 2022-01-11 17:29:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theyashjha Thanks so much, Yash. Cheers.
1480953115838980096 2022-01-11 17:21:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FoundersAtelier Absolutely. Thanks so much for reading it.
1480952606365261827 2022-01-11 17:19:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano Of course, thanks, Ben!
1480952553953181698 2022-01-11 17:19:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_grumpypancake_ Sure thing. Thanks for reading.
1480952516514918408 2022-01-11 17:19:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @copyforcreators Certainly! And thank you for the kind compliment.
1480952451842854914 2022-01-11 17:19:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yosifux I think you can't do anything well unless you truly understand your customer. So #1
1480952251082489862 2022-01-11 17:18:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandonkpbailey Thanks so much, Brandon.
1480949296849735686 2022-01-11 17:06:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm here to make your solopreneur journey easier.  That's why I write on Twitter.  If this was helpful, feel free to give me a follow → @JustinSaaS  If you have any questions, ask away. I'm happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading 👍🏻
1480949264645861380 2022-01-11 17:06:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Starting your solopreneur journey is a lot like building an MVP.  Resist the urge to get complex, and start simple.  Summary:  1. Get specific 2. Network small. 3. Infotainment wins. 4. Simple distribution to start. 5. Let your audience inform products.
1480949262808662017 2022-01-11 17:06:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ They monetize at the right time  You can't come out of the gate slinging product.  Money-making solopreneurs:  - Look for signals from their audience  - Often start with a service business to learn more - Use feedback to inform future product  Are you guessing or listening?
1480949260665462792 2022-01-11 17:06:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ They have focused distribution  You can build a great product, but distribution is King.  Smart solopreneurs:  - Don't play on every social channel when they start - Pick one that works &amp; learn the nuances - Double down on what resonates  Are you analyzing your content?
1480949258756968452 2022-01-11 17:06:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ They understand infotainment  On Twitter, we all want to be informed or entertained.  So, great solopreneurs:  - Teach people something they can apply immediately - Entertain them with other relevant stories - Make their audience think  Ask yourself: Does my content do this?
1480949256617869314 2022-01-11 17:06:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ They build a small but relevant network online  The best builders know it's better to build with others.  So they:  - Network with 3-5 impressive people in their space - Start regular, meaningful conversations - Think quality &gt; quantity  Are you networking or spraying?
1480949254533390346 2022-01-11 17:06:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ They nail their ideal customer persona  Part of building a one-person business is being crystal clear.  Focused solopreneurs:  - Move from Market  → sub-market → micro-market - Know exactly who they are talking to - Deeply understand their customer  Do you?
1480949245654052870 2022-01-11 17:06:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Why do some solopreneurs succeed while others fail?  I think I've figured it out.  THREAD: The 5 fundamentals of a one-person business:
1480941660347502605 2022-01-11 16:36:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano Tying the pain or problem to 3 things, in increasing order of importance:  - technical pain: generally how prospects describe pain  - monetary pain: turning technical pain into tangible dollars   - personal pain: tying personal goals, milestones, and success to solving it.
1480933373602369547 2022-01-11 16:03:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_lambert Nearly all ads you watch, landing pages you view, and copy you read amplify the prospect's pain.   Here's one of the most powerful commercials that does it well:  https://t.co/kS8kJoPMoz
1480908417782984710 2022-01-11 14:24:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @intlsosa Thanks, my man.
1480901425513254917 2022-01-11 13:56:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DenisJeliazkov It's certainly tough. Great books out there like Building a Storybrand by Donald Miller are really helpful.
1480896821333475331 2022-01-11 13:38:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HambyDavid Talk to them constantly. Listen with open ears and be open to the fact you don't understand them at all.
1480895339771146244 2022-01-11 13:32:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AuthorOnTheSide Understanding your customers. Nothing else works if you don't.
1480894081278611469 2022-01-11 13:27:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @juliemichellemo Always. They are the hero of the story.
1480892137571037187 2022-01-11 13:19:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6 marketing skills every solopreneur needs:  - Understanding your ideal customer's pain - Amplifying that pain until it's existential - Telling incredible customer stories - Sharing their transformations - Crafting the perfect offer - Asking people to buy
1480670156351279106 2022-01-10 22:37:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMKhateeb Ha. I'll take that.
1480617427960573953 2022-01-10 19:07:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thecorsta True story.
1480616309847216138 2022-01-10 19:03:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're a solopreneur, remember:  - Ideas are easy. - Execution is hard. - Consistency is harder.  Start and don't stop.
1480577062599598080 2022-01-10 16:27:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImtiazAli_1 I just mean it's best to build an audience before you build a product or service to sell.  Don't try to build one after.
1480553563533291524 2022-01-10 14:54:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MemeCodeMoney YES. Exactly. 🔥
1480543943087607812 2022-01-10 14:15:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmandaMGoetz Did Mexico City on my own and it was pure magic.
1480543618314248198 2022-01-10 14:14:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caan_al Thank you so much. I greatly appreciate it, Al!
1480536966278045706 2022-01-10 13:48:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @neurosys_zero Thanks, Mark. I talk to at least one person each day who wants to sell their product but has never even considered how to distribute it.   So they hit social media and start selling right away.  Crickets.
1480532667116498951 2022-01-10 13:31:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegoldsuite Exactly. If you have a community of interested people, selling becomes significantly easier.
1480531468984193027 2022-01-10 13:26:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don't build a product, then distribution.  Build distribution in anticipation of a future product.
1480517344208297989 2022-01-10 12:30:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AClaybight Awesome thread. Thanks for featuring me here, Alexander. Helps me think through how to continue my Twitter strategy. Appreciate it! 🙌
1480319162631303172 2022-01-09 23:22:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @optimalcoco Thank you so much!
1480260872954130438 2022-01-09 19:31:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jimmyslagl Get started and simply share your wins/losses. That's the easiest.
1480260788560580612 2022-01-09 19:30:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @toomaime Definitely.  The motivation part often comes from those rooting you on in your public journey, though.
1480260612592738306 2022-01-09 19:30:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jo5e_neto Love it. Even more glorious are the small wins.
1480260540685561859 2022-01-09 19:29:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach The accountability part is the magic. Easier to actually do things when you announce your intentions.
1480260411190616067 2022-01-09 19:29:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMKhateeb Exactly. And they attract champions on their journey.
1480260322149773320 2022-01-09 19:28:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith And your network grows leaps and bounds, fast.
1480252115692007439 2022-01-09 18:56:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build in public as a solopreneur.  Worst case?  You fail and have an insane digital resume.
1480196203728064514 2022-01-09 15:14:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheFalanBlake I get about 10 per day. I ignore them because I don't have time to be a job placement agency for thousands of people I don't know.
1480195117193519104 2022-01-09 15:09:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jeffrey_Funk Correct.  My best advice would be to narrow your focus. I'm sure that within your scattering there is an ideal customer profile that you enjoy working with and can serve extremely well.
1480193615934763016 2022-01-09 15:03:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jeffrey_Funk Thanks so much, Jeff.  Just means it looks clean on mobile. I test it out using a test account to make sure it's easy to read.
1480185743091941385 2022-01-09 14:32:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyNaitik Amazing. Congrats!
1480184072815194113 2022-01-09 14:25:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Alec_Coughlin BTW - grabbing coffee with Sloane this upcoming week. Thanks for the intro, Alec.
1480183389437243394 2022-01-09 14:23:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Sunday to entrepreneurs collaborating with people they've never met IRL.
1479928084975521800 2022-01-08 21:28:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Brennen_Smith_ Yes. 9,009. I attached a photo above to show the trend.
1479917396676784133 2022-01-08 20:46:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshuagowolabi Thanks, Joshua. Turns out it's more about the writer and less about the platform, ya know?
1479916940391026701 2022-01-08 20:44:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mehaines99 Much appreciated, Mark. 👏
1479916883503632387 2022-01-08 20:44:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kouters Keep formatting really tight for mobile.  30% improvement when I do.
1479914528221675520 2022-01-08 20:34:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ManagingPlaybk Thank you 🙌
1479914393823592450 2022-01-08 20:34:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kellen_the_man Super kind compliment, my man. Appreciate it!
1479913500994637831 2022-01-08 20:30:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 90 days ago I started writing daily here.  My goal: To share tips on solopreneurship with others.  The results:  - Tweets: 184 - Followers: +24,510 - Impressions: +6.8M - Profile visits: +18,042  Great experience.  If you were one of the folks who read anything I wrote, thanks!  https://t.co/QhydyjchcV
1479819199983853572 2022-01-08 14:16:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Saturday to entrepreneurs bouncing back from a failure.
1479793536283389958 2022-01-08 12:34:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jtunes1978 @spensermwarren @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush @SahilBloom @craigclemens @david_perell @hey_bernie @sweatystartup @jessievbreugel @DanesaGlez @Codie_Sanchez @RobbieCrab @pheadrick @araskin My 10-year old self loves this compliment. Thanks, man.
1479588509384155136 2022-01-07 22:59:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aseemthakar_ @_IlirAliu I have equity in my home and lots in former startups.   I’m not building a company that grants me the ability to sell at a multiple for a long term gain.
1479587817500119041 2022-01-07 22:56:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ClimbRideRunner Can’t all business advice basically be translated to life advice?
1479547687108284428 2022-01-07 20:17:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matthew_Fenton Great addition. Really smart question.
1479545611489878019 2022-01-07 20:08:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alf_poor Thanks, Alf!
1479529928655839233 2022-01-07 19:06:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BahWad Love that quote.
1479522681775079426 2022-01-07 18:37:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano @jasonlk I lived in LA. I miss the weather. I miss the different neighborhoods and culture.   I really miss the food. Anyone who says Nashville has a good food scene is out of their mind.
1479520844523184129 2022-01-07 18:30:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_IlirAliu The course took 30 days to build and is on track to do 6-figures this January, yes. Will likely slow down over the year.
1479520656450629641 2022-01-07 18:29:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikaelfyi Love that. Great questions.
1479518664248467462 2022-01-07 18:21:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aurasky_ Thanks, my man 🙌
1479518545314820102 2022-01-07 18:21:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_IlirAliu Using this lens.  Most of my businesses are low-effort/high-short term/low long-term.  For example: I'll do 6-figures in digital courses. Took 30 days to build.  I'll do 6-figures in advising at a high hourly rate.  But, I have zero long-term plays, like equity.
1479517926348804096 2022-01-07 18:18:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk We left 18 months ago.  2x bigger house, half the mortgage, and 10% of our income back.  Still? We miss it a lot. Might come back.
1479516696117493763 2022-01-07 18:14:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship is about priorities.  Every time you have an idea, ask yourself:  - Does this fit into the life I'm building? - Do I really want this responsibility? - Will I be happy in 6 months?  If the answer is no to any, skip it.  Push all decisions through this lens first.
1479415008471699459 2022-01-07 11:29:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Friday to everyone using the internet to fire themselves from their job.
1479264202581635072 2022-01-07 01:30:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @djchrisanthony Behind sharing a lot of efficiencies there is plenty of workaholism and burnout that needs to be addressed in 2022.   I promise it’s not all roses 🌹
1479246203095289858 2022-01-07 00:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Adhiguna_AIaaS LinkedIn. It’s been good to me.
1479235307061002241 2022-01-06 23:35:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CPASuperHero More people seeing my writing and becoming interested. Those people sharing with more people.  And so on...
1479235136390680579 2022-01-06 23:35:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sleeplessyogi This is just LinkedIn, where I started writing in 2019. So it's an apples to apples.  I only started consistently tweeting on October 11th. Before that, a smattering.  About to hit 90 days in a row here. Looking fwd to seeing how this grows.  https://t.co/KoyrBq1G3B
1479230821513023502 2022-01-06 23:18:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshghent Right back at ya, Josh. Write, analyze, double down.
1479228994809745409 2022-01-06 23:10:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A writing journey:  2019: 300 pieces of content, 9M impressions 2020: 300 pieces of content, 23M impressions 2021: 300 pieces of content, 38M impressions  It's not about more. It's about how it compounds.  Start today &amp; you'll be thankful soon.
1479223062239272971 2022-01-06 22:47:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdrienneNakohl @jthomas__ Thanks, Adrienne!
1479173806870740997 2022-01-06 19:31:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Robzkeet Yep.  I actually meant this as a comparison between entrepreneurship and being an employee but realized I didn't make that distinction clearly.  Either way, I prefer the former.
1479154815481565184 2022-01-06 18:16:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fausto_st Finding customers is harder for sure.  The payoff and reduction in risk is worth the effort, IMO.
1479146576014622729 2022-01-06 17:43:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1,000 customers at $100 a piece sounds way less risky than being a $100k line item at a budget-conscious company.
1479087468351836165 2022-01-06 13:48:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GraemeCrawley_ Damn, those are so good. Nice work, Graeme.
1479080378874966018 2022-01-06 13:20:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Thursday to solopreneurs hitting key MRR milestones.
1479075969260560385 2022-01-06 13:02:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dovhyi Love this. 🙌
1478908856516366336 2022-01-06 01:58:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SpiritofPines @Kellen_the_man I’ll invest in that.
1478906584696774657 2022-01-06 01:49:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aseemthakar_ @miloshjokic Good call. I actually have both of these.
1478899964646498305 2022-01-06 01:23:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @miloshjokic I honestly just love following and reading great creator content here on Twitter. I wish I had a better answer.
1478878508441120770 2022-01-05 23:58:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VolkCulture It could. There's no "right" way to do it.  Grow a meaningful audience and listen to what they need help with.  Build whatever you think is most helpful in solving it.
1478876448953978882 2022-01-05 23:49:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ale_bizpln I'd recommend keeping an eye on what @weskao is building (and who is joining) over at @MavenHQ
1478876093125910528 2022-01-05 23:48:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VolkCulture A few things:  1. Be efficient at your day job. Most jobs don't truly require 8 hours. Some do.  2. Keep your first side hustle simple. Create a short digital course or eBook once you've built a small, but highly engaged audience. Timebox production to 30 days.
1478869483708162056 2022-01-05 23:22:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @write_sfc I haven't personally been a part of it, but I hear great things about what @Nicolascole77 and @dickiebush are doing with Ship30for30. Seems to be everything a community should be.
1478866323480485901 2022-01-05 23:09:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @noeffortfinance Most 9 to 5 jobs don't actually require 8 hours of work.  Be efficient and you can do both.  Company grinding you out? Everyone's hiring.
1478865290284912650 2022-01-05 23:05:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SergioRocks 100%. Zero barrier to entry.
1478865207560740866 2022-01-05 23:05:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattlady Wild times. Will get wilder.
1478863474231029765 2022-01-05 22:58:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you’re employed you can still:  - Consult - Freelance - Write eBooks - Create video courses - Run a paid community - Write a paid newsletter - Do cohort-based coaching  The barrier to entry has never been lower.  The potential to replace your salary has never been higher.
1478824872373596161 2022-01-05 20:24:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GrowBara Nearly always. The most successful people I know are just plain curious.
1478821127581585413 2022-01-05 20:10:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most successful solopreneurs I know are just curious people obsessed with very specific problems.
1478820832910716935 2022-01-05 20:08:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichaelJNovotny Super kind of you, man. Always here to help folks. Cheers!
1478792672806588420 2022-01-05 18:17:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichaelJNovotny Congrats. I remember the feeling well. You got this 💪🏻
1478791363831418881 2022-01-05 18:11:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LearnEveryyDay I mean your product or service needs to solve a big enough problem that your customers care about.  Talking about it daily is simply shining a light on the problem and your solution.  Enough so that your prospects say "I have that problem too. Can you help me?"
1478784345016045573 2022-01-05 17:43:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @landforce @agazdecki Stop what you’re doing and ship something now.   Article, Tweet, drawing, thought, product, service, webpage. Whatever.   Make it a habit.
1478782569823059968 2022-01-05 17:36:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneSubstack It definitely is. Changes your ability to distribute your ideas.
1478782489829257223 2022-01-05 17:36:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DevLinguistic Oh 100%. But it’s a must as an entrepreneur.
1478782368869662725 2022-01-05 17:36:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamPeeches Thanks, man. Glad it resonated.
1478782292273291264 2022-01-05 17:35:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexAdadot Same. I guess folks are going to have to find it outside. A shame.
1478773823612891139 2022-01-05 17:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3 skills every entrepreneur needs:  - Problem-solving - Storytelling - Copywriting  1. Solve a big problem. 2. Make it relatable through a story. 3. Talk about it daily to attract customers.
1478742670784839680 2022-01-05 14:58:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Probably @sweatystartup
1478742594683293699 2022-01-05 14:58:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Yannick_Veys @jessievbreugel @alexgarcia_atx @TrungTPhan Thank you, my man! 🙌
1478718740594364420 2022-01-05 13:23:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Wednesday to solopreneurs with a clear calendar because they learned to say no.
1478483448620797957 2022-01-04 21:48:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amandanat @joshgcalderon Sometimes I wonder how desperate for attention people must be to use pregnancy or violence in their content.  Just pick up a book on copywriting for Christ's sake.
1478481494523924489 2022-01-04 21:40:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshgcalderon @amandanat I agree with what Amanda says here, but to me, that's just opportunity.   Of course, I also see a lot of miserable shit on Twitter.  Like, downright gross. It's all about feed curation.
1478434221488287757 2022-01-04 18:32:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush @dickiebush__ @dicklebush Done. Reported all 3. What a mess.
1478420485503438849 2022-01-04 17:38:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexCharlesGoff Sure thing. Here's an example of my calendar where I have non-negotiable blocks for content creation, meetings, walks, etc.  Then, I have empty calendar space for flexible opportunities such as someone approaching me for a partnership or a speaking opportunity.  https://t.co/nXNNz4hKWS
1478419923013709831 2022-01-04 17:35:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YehHoChukaHai If you have a good audience for distribution, you can build a microSaaS.   Acquire 500 users at $19 per month and suddenly you have a 6-figure business.  Pop it onto @microacquire and sell it.  Just one simple example.
1478415589299433473 2022-01-04 17:18:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyNaitik Absolutely.  Work in sprints, and work hard.  Then allow creativity and flexibility.
1478415493799325702 2022-01-04 17:18:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trevorgodfrey_ That's exactly what it is, and great call on self-awareness. A key skill.
1478412442413768704 2022-01-04 17:06:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship isn't about time, it's about discipline.  - Big goals - Check-in points - Daily action steps  My calendar is 40% regimented and 60% flexible.  Regimented for consistent achievement. Flexible for new opportunities.
1478403082698600465 2022-01-04 16:28:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_v3 Appreciate the kind shout, Bruce!
1478403022250287106 2022-01-04 16:28:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @katairobi Haha. Thanks, my man. Great compliment to receive.
1478402969947234315 2022-01-04 16:28:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @elizabutlermd @stephsmithio I already own this, and recommend it highly! Steph is an expert in her craft. Appreciate the share.
1478355351863021573 2022-01-04 13:19:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Tuesday to everyone increasing their luck by shipping often.
1478193382417649678 2022-01-04 02:35:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeoffTRoberts @SahilBloom Yep. Just chatting with some dev teams.
1478080740353089537 2022-01-03 19:08:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mrjoelcarter @SahilBloom Sorry, that wasn't very clear.  I'm focused on taking off one month per year, one week per month, and one day per week.  I usually have a craft beer every night so this should reduce calories drastically.
1478075728323354626 2022-01-03 18:48:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @54321Bdunn @SahilBloom I added it to the daily action step to take one month per year, one week per month, and one day per week off.   I usually have a craft beer each day so this should be a massive reduction.
1478075391235473415 2022-01-03 18:46:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Alec_Coughlin @SahilBloom @sloane927 Much appreciated, Alec.   Hey @sloane927 👋  New to town and still figuring it out.
1478074295632941057 2022-01-03 18:42:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Appreciate the framework.   Before I found it, I had 5 objectives and 23 key results.   This helped clean up my thinking.
1478073784422834181 2022-01-03 18:40:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyNaitik @SahilBloom Thanks for this.   I’m nailing down requirements from dev team (outsourced) and then will use that to inform exactly what I need.   First time building a SaaS so drinking from a firehose.   Will likely reach out. Cheers. 🙌🏻
1478072732667555846 2022-01-03 18:36:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyNaitik @SahilBloom This is great. Love it.
1478072302386356226 2022-01-03 18:34:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonfi @SahilBloom  https://t.co/io4zZTHMqV
1478071295946502149 2022-01-03 18:30:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom If you didn't check out the thread from @SahilBloom then you're missing out.  I feel like this is the best goal-setting framework I've come across.  RT it to show him some love.   https://t.co/d73zIowkMi  Happy New Year.  🎉
1478071291752198144 2022-01-03 18:30:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom 3/ Health &amp; wellness  BHAG: Drop 30 lbs to 185  Connected Medium-term: Weigh 200 lbs by February 15th  Tactical step 1: Walk 7 miles, 6x per week Tactical step 2: Reduce alcohol consumption  Exercise + 1 month, 1 week, 1 day no alcohol should do the trick.
1478071289734705153 2022-01-03 18:30:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom 2/ Business  BHAG: MVP of my first SaaS by April 1st  Connected Medium-term: Final mockups finished by February 15th  Tactical step 1: Spend 30 minutes, 4x week on mockups  Note: I've built SaaS as an executive operator, never a founder.  Open to all advice here.
1478071287738155008 2022-01-03 18:30:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom 1/ Personal life  BHAG: Establish a thriving social life in Nashville  Connected Medium-term: Host my first Nashville Creator Club in Q2  Tactical step 1: Connect w/ 2 new Nashville creators each week Tactical step 2: Spend 30 minutes each week planning my first event
1478071285754257411 2022-01-03 18:30:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Next up, I need the following:  - A big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG) for each - A medium-term connected goal to know I'm tracking well - Consistent tactical action steps that compound to reach my goals  Here are mine:
1478071283753566212 2022-01-03 18:30:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom I set the stage with 3 simple categories:  - Business - Personal life - Health &amp; wellness  There are other categories I could have added.   But those feel like "business as usual", meaning I'll likely accomplish them without setting goals.  Not everything needs to be tracked.
1478071281786494976 2022-01-03 18:30:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Before we get started, if you missed Sahil's post on January 1st, here's a TL;DR of his framework:  1. Set the Stage 2. Identify BHAG (big, hairy, audacious goal) 3. Work Backwards 4. Establish Process Goals 5. Track &amp; Adjust  (I'll link to his thread at the end)
1477994722522243075 2022-01-03 13:26:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Monday to solopreneurs taking small, well-calculated risks.
1477824133551603715 2022-01-03 02:08:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyeaslo Thanks so much for including me here. Much appreciated 🙌🏻
1477807651316772864 2022-01-03 01:02:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aseemthakar_ Amazing! Thank you for this.
1477804936075354118 2022-01-03 00:52:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aseemthakar_ Reading it right this minute.
1477803001582698498 2022-01-03 00:44:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaylance Mostly just inside of my courses, tbh.    https://t.co/4tJ1SpowfB
1477800462183190530 2022-01-03 00:34:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FamousAlan I’m introverted in group settings with people I don’t know.   In a setting around trusted friends, I’m pretty outgoing.
1477715355736977413 2022-01-02 18:56:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Attention is currency for solopreneurs.  Learn how to get that attention organically online.  If you do, traditional "marketing" becomes a lot easier.
1477647400575672324 2022-01-02 14:26:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Sunday to everyone building an intentional life through solopreneurship.
1477391278451175431 2022-01-01 21:28:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Totally.   The definition of upside can be fluid from person to person.
1477338259122446341 2022-01-01 17:57:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justinmooretfam I like high quality, high quantity, high virality via word-of-mouth.  People come out swinging with $1,200 price points and haven't built the trust necessary to drive that conversion.  Mine are impulse buys that deliver 100x.  Just how I think about it.
1477337033165225984 2022-01-01 17:52:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justinmooretfam 85% from OS, yes. All products are $150 but I featured discounts throughout the year.
1477336932363517956 2022-01-01 17:52:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ssaripal80 My guess is that you likely took upside to mean money.  To me, upside encompasses things like passion, enjoyment, network opportunity, etc.
1477324519857692684 2022-01-01 17:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every job is hard.  Pick the "hard" with the biggest upside.
1477286324516405249 2022-01-01 14:31:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thepennydrop3 Morning. Happy new year. 🙌🏻
1477284257324220423 2022-01-01 14:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Saturday to solopreneurs adding a new revenue stream this year.
1477256459125669897 2022-01-01 12:32:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samridhijain_19 DM me your email and I’ll get you taken care of. Sorry about the trouble!
1477079487401582598 2022-01-01 00:49:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarcLittlemore Thanks for your support! Have a wonderful NYE 🙌🏻
1477057811808935938 2021-12-31 23:23:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2021 was a crazy year for info products.  Thank you to the 3,771 customers who invested their time &amp; money into one of my products.  I appreciate you.  This channel grew 500% this year, and I'm pumped to see what happens in 2022.  If you're selling online, keep going! 🚀  https://t.co/7W4qPdXjGv
1477026899314589699 2021-12-31 21:20:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @btmitchell25 @Josh_G_Roth @BrianBrackeen We’re coming to check it out and a move isn’t out of the question. Appreciate it!
1477026512566202368 2021-12-31 21:18:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shireenjaffer_ @brendanjshort @Raaid27 Amazing. Thank you! Much appreciated.
1477023408009449474 2021-12-31 21:06:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Guilty.
1477022580578074634 2021-12-31 21:03:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor Sweet. Are those places pretty accessible to the rest of the city?  Down for a beer for sure.
1477020774775017481 2021-12-31 20:56:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Miami folks: I want to come visit in Q1.  And I know very little about the city...  What are the best neighborhoods to stay for a couple of 40-something foodies who also like cocktails?
1476983951403147267 2021-12-31 18:29:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Great thread, Sachin. I appreciate you including me and for the extremely kind words.   2022 gonna be big for you. 🔥
1476976986727882753 2021-12-31 18:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don't complain about a product.  Build a better one and sell it.
1476915899663892486 2021-12-31 13:59:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @katairobi Nice, Robert! I hope you love it. 🔥
1476915809956110348 2021-12-31 13:59:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickB2005 Have a lawyer create your own Ts and Cs. Then, don't budge. That's my motto.
1476914814903635973 2021-12-31 13:55:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Aniketmlive @owenvideo @Daniel_Batal @ColinandSamir Appreciate that, Aniket. Cheers to a big 2022.
1476906251737092098 2021-12-31 13:21:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Friday to entrepreneurs working to impress themselves, not others.
1476905384883503104 2021-12-31 13:17:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher gm. Have a great NYE, Jack. Hope all is well.
1476675432602906630 2021-12-30 22:03:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CFOAdam That's awesome to hear. Thanks!
1476675302654889987 2021-12-30 22:03:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @quillynl Works for anyone, but I mostly talk to solopreneurs.
1476599497878818821 2021-12-30 17:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneur marketing strategy:  Figure things out in public.
1476543628830990344 2021-12-30 13:20:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Thursday to entrepreneurs unashamedly building a lifestyle business.
1476317075241148424 2021-12-29 22:19:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tanyamoushi Thank you, Tanya!
1476316330341146625 2021-12-29 22:16:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This is a play you can run over and over.  By doing so, you start to systematize solutions to the same challenge.  Work becomes easier and more efficient.  "Oh, I've seen this before - I know what to do."  Run this play in 2022.
1476316328852086797 2021-12-29 22:16:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3 reasons I like this strategy:  1. It allows me to work on challenges I enjoy.  2. It makes the engagement low-risk because payment is based on business improvement.  3. It helps me form strong relationships and create a referral network early.  That network compounds.
1476316327249915908 2021-12-29 22:16:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If I had to start my entrepreneur journey over again, here's what I'd do:  - Choose a skill I know cold - Find 2-3 companies struggling - Setup "improvement-based" pay - Track all meaningful improvement - Ask for testimonials for my website - Get intros to other similar companies
1476309435052142600 2021-12-29 21:49:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach Yes, it was hard. No, it didn't come easy.  Today? Easy as can be.  It's just a muscle you build. Start small.
1476298724230025221 2021-12-29 21:06:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Creator_Coach Share your knowledge freely with no expectation.
1476264919414841347 2021-12-29 18:52:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thegoldsuite Yep, basically what I wrote in this thread. We're aligned.   https://t.co/t5QW8A88N1
1476264703139753985 2021-12-29 18:51:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rufaimunye @jackbutcher @visualizevalue I don't know that there's a right way.  Jack has a distinct personal brand and a very unique visual process.  IMO, start by becoming known for something, and worry less about the details of one vs. two.
1476264156429000704 2021-12-29 18:49:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdrienneNakohl I think it helps to be intentional.   Doesn't mean you'll get to where you thought you were going though.  Keep it simple and flexible.
1476263355409219591 2021-12-29 18:46:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build a brand where people want to follow you and companies want to hire you.  Incredible leverage.
1476252517558325254 2021-12-29 18:03:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kjellvdv I don't help people invest, rather I support people by investing in them.  I've written 4 angel checks to friends I believe in.

1476237107261812749 2021-12-29 17:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Solopreneurship 101:  - Learn a skill at work - Consult with that skill for a reasonable rate - Learn about your customer's most pressing needs - Niche down to solving only that and raise your rates - Productize everything else you learned and sell it online
1476230319149879308 2021-12-29 16:35:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Designing an intentional life makes you one of the wealthiest people you can be.
1476189669356457991 2021-12-29 13:53:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EmmySobieski Thank you, Emmy 🙌🏻
1476181992257597443 2021-12-29 13:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Wednesday to entrepreneurs diversifying their income.
1476017172006715402 2021-12-29 02:28:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tim_Denning @creation247 I own his course and somehow wasn’t following him. Thanks for the nudge, Tim!
1476014965291159556 2021-12-29 02:19:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcesarromero @Viernest @Yannick_Veys It’s less the downside of Buffer and more the upside of HypeFury.   Trial both of them. You’ll see.
1475971822948691968 2021-12-28 23:27:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Start by embracing slight discomfort.  It's amazing how much easier it gets over time...
1475952879403941891 2021-12-28 22:12:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Newsletters are like books.  Most could do without the filler.
1475949615593762822 2021-12-28 21:59:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMKhateeb Feels like the other 10% is taking what you learned from the small risks and making adjustments.  Entrepreneurship (at least so far) feels like risk, adjustments, risk, adjustment, risk, adjustment, etc.
1475942165876514819 2021-12-28 21:30:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reneefishman I'm simply talking about businesses without any employees.   My wife is a huge part of our success for sure.
1475934469530001412 2021-12-28 20:59:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kjellvdv Supporting people and helping them succeed.
1475933995670151173 2021-12-28 20:57:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdrienneNakohl Ignore my use of autonomous when I meant auto-didactic.
1475933535374557192 2021-12-28 20:55:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cwtorek Yep. The other 10% is just paying attention to what happens and making better decisions.
1475932761303171080 2021-12-28 20:52:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdrienneNakohl Most of education is spent learning to conform. Maybe that’s why?
1475932245496057856 2021-12-28 20:50:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luke_netti Glad I’m not the only one 🙌🏻
1475931560113233926 2021-12-28 20:48:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wadboy_ Yep. Each one feels a bit easier.
1475931112379760640 2021-12-28 20:46:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It feels like 90% of being an entrepreneur is taking small but uncomfortable risks.
1475921582610694159 2021-12-28 20:08:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Viernest They just released direct posting to LinkedIn, which makes it extremely valuable.   To me, it’s the best tool on the market. I just left Buffer for it.   @Yannick_Veys - anything to add here?
1475882870531145728 2021-12-28 17:34:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Therapy is a game changer.   If it’s in your budget, everyone, regardless of how they feel should go.   Been going for over a year and it helps me understand (and overcome) my fears.
1475882571691175937 2021-12-28 17:33:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister Keep running this process, and you’ll continue to increase your prices. Get after it.
1475882301565423616 2021-12-28 17:32:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BahWad Appreciate it!
1475882254798839813 2021-12-28 17:32:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArrigoLupori People often niche down and then forget to update their messaging. Then, it doesn’t jive.   Easily overlooked.
1475882068643131396 2021-12-28 17:31:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VladPasca5 Thanks so much for reading it, Vlad.
1475875750301650948 2021-12-28 17:06:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Just a short one today.  Hopefully, you found some nuggets in here to improve your service business next year.  If you found this valuable, give me a follow for weekly threads on entrepreneurship &amp; internet income → @justinsaas  Have a wonderful last week of 2021.  Cheers.
1475875748380647430 2021-12-28 17:06:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> TL;DR  1. Ask for feedback from customers early &amp; often 2. Understand the part of your business they love 3. Document feelings about what you enjoy 4. Find the intersection of numbers 2 &amp; 3 5. Adjust messaging across the web 6. Ask for testimonials ruthlessly 7. Raise your rates
1475875745625001985 2021-12-28 17:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Increase your rates  Now you have a:  - Niche - Ideal customer - Crystal clear offer - Plenty of social proof  Now double your rates.  Even if you lose 2x more deals, you'll make the same money and work 50% of the time.  Keep pushing your rates until the math doesn't work.
1475875743561363464 2021-12-28 17:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Testimonials  Testimonials improve conversion from web visitor → booked call  It’s also a key driver behind price increases.  Your goal is to get testimonials from customers in your niche.  This will greatly improve the likelihood of booked calls from future great customers.
1475875734065487878 2021-12-28 17:06:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Clarify  With your newly optimized business, it's time to adjust messaging.  Start with:  - Content - Website - Sales pitch - Social profiles - Landing pages  Make it crystal clear who you work with, what you help them do, and how you help them do it.  This is your new niche.
1475875728885489669 2021-12-28 17:06:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Optimize  Next, optimize your business by:  - Developing &amp; expanding areas you and your customer enjoy.  - Eliminating things you and your customers don’t.  You want to find the intersection of what you enjoy &amp; what customers want more of.  That's ALL your going to focus on.
1475875726683480064 2021-12-28 17:06:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Get feedback  First, you need to understand what part of your business customers love and want more of.  Ask simple questions:  - Where do your customers get the most value from you?  - What do they wish they could get more of?  - Don't forget: what do YOU enjoy the most?

1475827672672612354 2021-12-28 13:55:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom Great thread. I fell victim to so many of these, especially dopamine, low-time leverage, and overcommitting.   2022 plans are starting with how I want to spend my time, and rearranging my businesses to fit around that.  Excellent reminder. Cheers to a big 2022, Sahil.

1475513868780724231 2021-12-27 17:08:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Varun_Bosmia I've dabbled on LinkedIn.
1475511656725815305 2021-12-27 16:59:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I want to know more incredible solopreneurs.  In 2022, I'm going to be shining a light on more one-person businesses in my newsletter.  Tell me - who should I be following?
1475499822815842314 2021-12-27 16:12:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @akramquraishi Get everyone aligned and hold people accountable.
1475494756612513794 2021-12-27 15:52:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GregoryCronie Correct.
1475493465366671362 2021-12-27 15:47:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GregoryCronie When I was a SaaS executive, always quarterly.  For my family, I prefer yearly but may adjust in the future.  No specific reason for yearly, just feels right.
1475492640993026049 2021-12-27 15:43:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BigWillieStein Great point.  Also, add risk and adjusted game plan for risk.
1475492446914162694 2021-12-27 15:43:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackhilbrich Great question.  For the most part, I let my prospects and customers guide me. It's the easiest way to make a good choice.  At the same time, I've been in the space for 3 years, and I know what people actually need, plus how to create the messaging that guides them to purchase.
1475490911060742146 2021-12-27 15:37:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackhilbrich I break down my business this way.  I know how many impressions, visitors, etc. I need each day for each product and service. Then, I go find them.

1475487098601971716 2021-12-27 15:21:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mr_M_E We get so bogged down in the minutia that it becomes difficult to pull back.  If you haven't yet, this is your week to make it happen.
1475486306843049984 2021-12-27 15:18:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Welcome to the most underrated week of the year.  Time to disconnect from tactics &amp; focus on strategy:  - Objectives - Key results - Distribution - Systems &amp; support  Then, how do you break yearly goals into daily action?  Remember: Your year is simply the aggregate of your days.
1475477208869351426 2021-12-27 14:42:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Writing and business both.   Start with one customer that has one very distinct problem.   Solve that and you have yourself the start of a business.
1475460919232806915 2021-12-27 13:37:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SimonHoiberg I reversed.   Started on LinkedIn. Built to 120k.  Then, added Twitter about 12 weeks ago, and the diversification has been great.  New audience, new insights, new ideas.   But, I'm glad I started by going deep on one rather than managing 2 platforms simultaneously.
1475459926097080324 2021-12-27 13:33:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ecommercefrank Nice. I'm so glad to hear that.   Same here.

1473742174890172420 2021-12-22 19:48:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alemaoinvestor Writing is a great way to understand something.   Find something you’re curious about and write what you learn.   You’ll get smarter and people who are interested in the topic will likely read your stuff. Win/win.
1473738389933506572 2021-12-22 19:33:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alemaoinvestor Mostly about building SaaS companies because that's what I was doing.
1473737932733308939 2021-12-22 19:31:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Johnbryant1997 Good call.
1473737886189109258 2021-12-22 19:31:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kellen_the_man Yeah, that's not a bad point.
1473737838487289861 2021-12-22 19:30:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thecorsta Yep. Good call.
1473731596775825411 2021-12-22 19:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Acquiring customers &gt; acquiring followers
1473721905316257801 2021-12-22 18:27:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt Congrats!
1473721838693933062 2021-12-22 18:27:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PatrickMignault Great question.  I considered something "written" when I published it out into the universe. That was it for me.
1473714401714782220 2021-12-22 17:57:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Thanks, man! I appreciate that.  It's wild to look back on. I'm not great with many habits, but this has been one of them.
1473702541791842313 2021-12-22 17:10:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fmatatome I don't really, but my goal is to at least create one piece of short-form content that I feel good shipping.  This post would be an example of bare minimum.
1473702396270415884 2021-12-22 17:10:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wadboy_ Definitely.   Writing helps me make sense of the content I consume.
1473702280222421005 2021-12-22 17:09:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano I missed when I genuinely felt uncreative. Even then, I technically "wrote" something.  But not enough for it to be shipped.  Generally a good nights sleep, a walk, and some coffee kept me going.
1473700400226344960 2021-12-22 17:02:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I committed to writing daily 36 months ago. Here are my results:  → 84.7% adherence → 1,300+ unique pieces → 165,000+ new social followers  Not 100%, but what a wild journey.  I'm convinced habitual writing makes any entrepreneur better.
1473700268613189638 2021-12-22 17:01:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @balajis Currently:  - Ghost - Carrd - Gumroad - Stripe  Next:  - Kajabi
1473643427258675216 2021-12-22 13:15:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Wednesday to entrepreneurs who were told, "not everyone is meant to be an entrepreneur."
1473426469280010240 2021-12-21 22:53:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Appreciate the mention here, Dickie.  I've learned so much from following great writers like yourself. Cheers to an even bigger (and more enjoyable) 2022.

1473341916267831298 2021-12-21 17:17:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VladPasca5 Much appreciated, my man. 🙌
1473339779286806538 2021-12-21 17:09:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor I don't actually have a script for this ask because it's personal. If you use templates to make critical asks to important people, it just doesn't work...
1473339073687433218 2021-12-21 17:06:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Well...that's it for today.  Hope you found some nuggets you can apply to your journey.  If you enjoyed this thread:  1. Follow me for more threads on entrepreneurship → @justinsaas  2. Here’s another thread of mine you might enjoy:  https://t.co/3zVqEe0ggx  Be kind in 2022 👋
1473339071665774595 2021-12-21 17:06:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 15/ Remember  In the end, I remembered that life is short.  Too many days in front of the computer means too few days with my beautiful wife.  The computer, business, revenue, and social media will always be there.  Our precious time with loved ones will not.  Remember that.
1473339069606334468 2021-12-21 17:06:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 14/ Seek  To better broaden my worldview, I also sought out those who think differently about the world than I do.  Different politics. Different cultures. Different viewpoints.  It was enriching and allowed me to empathize with people I normally wouldn't.  Conversation &gt; news
1473339067869941763 2021-12-21 17:06:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 13/ Relax  2019 &amp; 2020 were years where I felt frustrated on social media.  I was succeeding in building my network and businesses, but politics &amp; the world were upsetting.  So, in 2021, I turned it all off.   Eliminated Twitter trends. Blocked news sites.  Talk about relaxing.
1473339064791314443 2021-12-21 17:06:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 12/ Eliminate  In balancing my businesses, I was doing a lot of things I didn't like doing.  So, I just started saying no to things I didn't enjoy.  The easiest way for me to do this was with "No" templates.  Shout out to @thepatwalls for his "How to Say No" series.  Lifesaver.
1473339061922320384 2021-12-21 17:06:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 11/ Diversify  Until late 2021, I was on one social platform: LinkedIn  I had grown to 130k+ followers but had always felt a bit timid on Twitter.  12 weeks ago, I decided to just go for it.  The result? 26k followers interested in my journey.  Diversify where you create.
1473339060198547468 2021-12-21 17:06:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ Listen  My businesses really started taking off when I remembered that my customers tell me what to create next.  Instead of building what I wanted, I asked more questions and listened intently to the answers.  The result?   A $305k improvement in product sales.
1473339057136623634 2021-12-21 17:06:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/ Ask  You don't get what you don't ask for.   That doesn't mean ask willy nilly. It means being smart with my asks.  In 2021 I talked to people I never would have imagined speaking to.  Interviewed amazing guests.  Was featured on sites I felt were out of my reach.  Ask!
1473339027583549443 2021-12-21 17:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Give  In 2020, I didn't give much back in terms of my time or money. I was overwhelmed.  Candidly, it made me feel a lack of purpose.  This year, I've spent a lot of time giving away my time, donating to causes I support, &amp; finding ways to spread love anonymously.  Purpose ⬆️
1473339025801060358 2021-12-21 17:06:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Collaborate  2021 was all about collaboration for me.  Built an incredible community of over 500 people across 51 countries.  Just jamming out on Slack, building in public, releasing products, and supporting one another.  More focus on relationships in 2022.
1473339023955537927 2021-12-21 17:06:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Ignore  With over 165k social media followers across 2 channels, you get a lot of nasty comments.  People are mean. Angry. Condescending. Cruel. Shitty.  I got really aggressive with the block button in 2021.  My content, my mental health, my rules.
1473339022122627081 2021-12-21 17:06:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Rest  In 2019, I burned out at my executive job.  In mid-2021, I was running the risk of doing the same as a creator.  My solution?  - 6 mile daily walks - 30-minute built-in breaks - One day per week off (failed)  2 out of 3 ain't bad.   In 2022, I'll be better.
1473339020138659848 2021-12-21 17:06:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Focus  I've spent time as a SaaS advisor, coach, mentor, investor, and digital product creator.  2021 was the first year I really spent the majority of my time focused on product.  2020 product revenue: 19% of income 2021 product revenue: 52% of revenue  Income up. Time down.
1473339018263896075 2021-12-21 17:06:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Repurpose  My business runs on content.  And after writing unique pieces every day for over 2 years, I finally started to repurpose  It made me nervous.  The outcome?  Nobody noticed and the pieces were widely read by people who had never seen them the first time around.
1473339016141590541 2021-12-21 17:06:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Reduce  My 4 businesses run on so many pieces of technology.  Bills add up, things break, and opportunities are missed.  I cut a bunch of technology and folded all of my businesses into a new site, launching soon.  All-in-one tech makes things so much more manageable.

1473282507147730946 2021-12-21 13:21:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @ShaneAParrish @SahilBloom @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @alexgarcia_atx @agazdecki @arvidkahl @aaditsh @blakeaburge Thank you, my man. 🙌
1473281889137999880 2021-12-21 13:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Tuesday to entrepreneurs who realize almost nothing sells itself.
1473074516423237632 2021-12-20 23:35:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays @thedankoe  https://t.co/4ZAUI0giUf
1473013838102552583 2021-12-20 19:34:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @engeniusprep @categorypirates Negative present and positive future are 2 very important sales and marketing lessons.
1473006100911898631 2021-12-20 19:03:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Entrepreneurs need great content to attract customers.  Ask yourself these 2 questions before you hit publish:  "Does this content challenge my prospect's thinking?" "Does this content teach my prospect something new?"  If either is a "yes", you're more likely to have a winner.
1472979225015734281 2021-12-20 17:16:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe Thanks for asking great questions. It's a rarity these days.
1472977904648740866 2021-12-20 17:11:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe has one of the realest podcasts around.  Enjoyed spending some time with him chatting about:  - Life - Health - Business - Products - and more...  Give it a listen if you have some time.
1472928244030656517 2021-12-20 13:53:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MattMHarriman Always.  The dream is the customer's future state.   Your product has to deliver...
1472923860945326085 2021-12-20 13:36:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro Nailed it. (Construction pun)
1472923688156684289 2021-12-20 13:35:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush - Being autodidactic - Focusing on self-care - Learning how to say no
1472921286255038471 2021-12-20 13:26:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Monday to entrepreneurs selling the dream, not the product.
1472732482281873413 2021-12-20 00:56:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DBarnettMoncton @girdley @SullyBusiness LinkedIn automation is the worst.
1472716754778533890 2021-12-19 23:53:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GoodsCapital Almost never. I’m an introvert.
1472705938733817859 2021-12-19 23:10:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @linkedin_king @jkostecki_rei @SanchizeUnfltrd @girdley @SullyBusiness @mrshadeed Good stuff. No one way to skin a cat, as we're seeing.  It's a great platform for solopreneurs, entrepreneurs, and creators.  Built my 140k followers organically over 3 years and it's been an incredibly rewarding experience.
1472705625478111241 2021-12-19 23:09:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GoodsCapital @girdley @SullyBusiness @sweatystartup I'm a one-man show. It's a lot of work, but I enjoy it.  I don't ever want to outsource content or engagement. Feels too inauthentic.
1472652387051524098 2021-12-19 19:37:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @girdley @SullyBusiness I’ve found almost nobody is.   Most people are executive coaches, e-commerce folks, financial people, etc.
1472648236674465797 2021-12-19 19:21:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Love this, Max. Have a few of his books on my shelf that are in need of a read.
1472648091690016772 2021-12-19 19:20:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heychazza Just putting yourself out there works wonders.
1472647923431354374 2021-12-19 19:20:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness Lets get it, Bryant. 🔥
1472641913744465926 2021-12-19 18:56:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The easiest way to "network" is to do interesting things &amp; attract interesting people.
1472584441231036416 2021-12-19 15:07:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @smitawasthi @Josh_G_Roth  https://t.co/c2xxkadUUw
1472573991651098626 2021-12-19 14:26:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Sunday to entrepreneurs doing good and feeling good.
1472277696730304514 2021-12-18 18:48:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Thank you, my friend.
1472239126380531712 2021-12-18 16:15:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Thank you for sharing, my man. Very much appreciated. 🙌
1472210824857112589 2021-12-18 14:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Saturday to entrepreneurs who know therapy is growth.
1471991778698006536 2021-12-17 23:52:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NathanClark_ Haha. I'm old.  I don't know these newfangled acronyms.   But, I'm certainly aware of it after this Tweet.
1471908989621325826 2021-12-17 18:23:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FreedomWriter0 Not really.  You can automate tasks, emails, responses, payments, etc. right from the beginning.
1471905461179797505 2021-12-17 18:09:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rebelmktr @IAgreeWithYou_ Also an option. Whatever gets you away from that computer.
1471903552079544323 2021-12-17 18:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most entrepreneurs talking about freedom are actually obsessed with work.  Real freedom comes with:  - Elimination - Automation - Delegation  Sitting in front of the computer for 16 hours doesn't make you "free".  Take this weekend to E.A.D.
1471833870035263492 2021-12-17 13:25:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Friday to entrepreneurs who realize psychology is just as important as marketing.
1471527196963401733 2021-12-16 17:06:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Absolutely brilliant. Great template.  I'm in the process of piping all of my website inquiries into AirTable. My "no" templates are installed, and changing a status triggers them to send for different things:  - No to podcast - No to brain picking - No to consulting client
1471526101616893952 2021-12-16 17:02:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Key skill for entrepreneurs:  Say "no" to most requests for your time.  You probably don't need to be on that podcast.   You need uninterrupted work.
1471470196212834309 2021-12-16 13:20:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Thursday to the entrepreneurs clearing their calendar.
1471194886359638017 2021-12-15 19:06:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to start an online coaching business:  1. Learn how to solve one specific challenge 2. Create content to help your audience 3. Build a landing page on Carrd 4. Embed Gumroad or Stripe 5. Publish your new website 6. Promote your business 7. Ask people to buy 8. Get paid
1471166131238957059 2021-12-15 17:11:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryancwalkr Definitely applies to more than online course marketing, but I see people miss this 101 in that space, in particular.   Mostly because they aren't marketers or salespeople, just solopreneurs who have never sold themselves.
1471165141370638337 2021-12-15 17:07:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro Love that addition. Thanks, Sahil.
1471165035338625025 2021-12-15 17:07:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Answer all of their worries and objections in the copy.
1471163690011529220 2021-12-15 17:02:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Online course marketing 101:  Your offer should answer, "What, exactly, will customers achieve?"  It's not: "Learn how to invest in the market."  It's: "In less than 1 hour, you'll learn to invest your first $10k in the market without an expensive advisor."  Clarity is critical.
1471108581059710978 2021-12-15 13:23:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Wednesday to entrepreneurs firing customers who don't treat them well.
1470967099178713088 2021-12-15 04:01:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jsaunders_ The plan is simple. Sticking with it is the hard part for sure.
1470954156407934976 2021-12-15 03:09:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @landforce They’re also super “hacky”.   Pods, cheats, etc.   Much better just building organically.
1470945791585894400 2021-12-15 02:36:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DanJakaitis 👍🏻
1470902834128326660 2021-12-14 23:45:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mmahoney587 @JamesonCamp @theandreboso @thedankoe @landforce @aaditsh Pretty simple, tbh. I just act online like I might offline.   Shoot a DM. Tell them I think their work is interesting. See where it goes.   Too many people ask for advice, try and give fake value (I found a spelling error on your site) or just otherwise act burdensome.
1470879112575143938 2021-12-14 22:11:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattwhitehill1 @JamesonCamp @theandreboso @thedankoe @landforce @aaditsh Treat online like you would offline.
1470826724577271809 2021-12-14 18:43:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisSamp1 I added them after I got to about 10k. I’d say focus on educational tweets and add them in later.
1470825104808415232 2021-12-14 18:36:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VladPasca5 Thanks, Vlad. Just keeping it simple.
1470821461203902469 2021-12-14 18:22:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyblake I'm just out here trying to catch you, man.  🔥

1470820352909402114 2021-12-14 18:17:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje Just trying to keep pace with you, dude. 🙌

1470818071451299842 2021-12-14 18:08:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson It does!
1470809951505293319 2021-12-14 17:36:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro Boom! Congrats, man. You're doing everything right.
1470803887435116544 2021-12-14 17:12:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp @theandreboso @thedankoe @landforce @aaditsh Same, James. Excited to get to know each other more in 2022.
1470803313713053698 2021-12-14 17:10:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe @JamesonCamp @theandreboso @landforce @aaditsh Right back at you, man.
1470803266464141318 2021-12-14 17:09:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArrigoLupori Appreciate the kind words, man. Thanks for giving it a read.
1470802317754912768 2021-12-14 17:06:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That's it. Just a short one today.  I hope you found this simple thread valuable as you're growing.  If you enjoyed it:  1. Give me a follow for more threads on entrepreneurship → @justinsaas  2. Here’s another similar thread of mine you might enjoy:  https://t.co/P06K4A0FTS
1470802315599056896 2021-12-14 17:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> And that's literally it.  No gimmickss. No hacks. No tricks. No pods.  TL;DR  1/ A "touch base" tweet each AM 2/ An educational tweet each PM 3/ A step-by-step thread once weekly 4/ Engage with 5 people in my niche each day
1470802313409605632 2021-12-14 17:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Engage with 5 people in my niche each day  Each day, I meet great new people on Twitter.  Here are some impressive folks I've chatted with, just to see where it goes:  - @JamesonCamp - @theandreboso - @TheDanKoe - @landforce - @aaditsh  It's called social media for a reason.
1470802310712356866 2021-12-14 17:06:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ A step-by-step thread once weekly  Weekly threads power my growth.  I gain hundreds (or thousands) of followers by sharing detailed threads.  My goal is to walk someone step-by-step through something critical in entrepreneurship.   https://t.co/s4FAdKj4VD
1470802307679875072 2021-12-14 17:06:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ An educational tweet each PM  Each afternoon, I share a lesson from my entrepreneurial journey.  Topics include:  - Service businesses - Building information products - Using social media effectively  My only goal is to help ONE person keep growing.   https://t.co/7EFqrCv7jZ
1470802300860043274 2021-12-14 17:06:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ A "touch base" tweet each AM  Each morning, I touch base with my audience.  My simple goal?   Provide morning motivation to keep other entrepreneurs building.  It also puts my name and face in front of people on a regular basis.   https://t.co/bDR9xiUaB9
1470802298758922240 2021-12-14 17:06:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A growing Twitter audience is an asset to any entrepreneur.  I've added 14,547 followers in just 10 weeks.  Here are the 4 very simple things I did:
1470763202761805828 2021-12-14 14:30:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CrishanMendez @JamesonCamp There isn't much information, just a page on my website here:  https://t.co/4BwvoMzR8s  Shoot me a DM if you want to ask anything specific before committing. Happy to let you know if it's a good/poor fit.
1470745173571342347 2021-12-14 13:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Tuesday to entrepreneurs holding themselves ultimately accountable.
1470580191722233860 2021-12-14 02:23:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aseemthakar_ Real estate makes up about 30% of my net worth, and with bonds I’m not sure (my wife manages our wealth). Shares I took to mean options so it’s a guessing game. Could be millions, could be nothing. I hope the former. 🤞🏻
1470577346272907267 2021-12-14 02:12:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aseemthakar_ I have real estate, shares and bonds.I don’t have super deep expertise in those areas, so I don’t spend a lot of time talking about them though.
1470549768136912896 2021-12-14 00:22:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mr_M_E @JamesonCamp Haha. Thanks man.   Plenty of royal screwups in my journey.
1470549616533782534 2021-12-14 00:22:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp I do 1:1 coaching for SaaS founders and sales leaders. I also do it for creators looking to build their first digital product.
1470487072209346560 2021-12-13 20:13:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CooperKraussKC Always. Shoot an email to hello@justinwelsh.me (you’ll get an auto-responder) but we’ll get you set up if interested.
1470486274209456138 2021-12-13 20:10:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @Builtfirst @aaroncbailey Would love to learn more.
1470469350675124225 2021-12-13 19:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My 2022 diversified business plan:  - Courses (more) - Coaching (continue) - Community (continue) - Affiliate for SaaS (add) - My own micro-SaaS (add)  What's your 2022 portfolio of income look like?
1470418556047147011 2021-12-13 15:41:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyblake Appreciate the mention here, Blake. Looks like I have some new creators to follow.  Appreciate it!
1470384539189059589 2021-12-13 13:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Monday to everyone learning about business by starting one.
1470150319032078336 2021-12-12 21:55:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rebelmktr I’m glad you did. Now I can use the correct word moving forward! Thank you.
1470130960226144256 2021-12-12 20:38:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rebelmktr Correct. My mistake.
1470130957671809028 2021-12-12 20:38:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmerTheus Yep. Turns out you don’t have to be that smart hence my point 😂
1470097438622896136 2021-12-12 18:25:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Alec_Coughlin  https://t.co/dbC5Nts0Dv
1470079286723940353 2021-12-12 17:13:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cedriclee77 I've heard this story so many times...happens to a lot of folks.
1470075004570279936 2021-12-12 16:56:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The best entrepreneurs I know aren't always "smart".  They’re autonomous.  Learning how to teach yourself is a skill worth building.
1470037284078723073 2021-12-12 14:26:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Sunday to everyone building slowly &amp; sustainably.
1469733745674567685 2021-12-11 18:20:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshgcalderon Sure but building anything (in public or otherwise) comes with doubters and trolls.  The upside (in my opinion) drastically outweighs the downside.
1469714386973605897 2021-12-11 17:03:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The upside of building in public:  - More intrigue - More attention - More conversations - Better feedback loop  The downside is what people will think of you.  Once you realize they don't, the downside goes away.

1469443470163075079 2021-12-10 23:06:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @acamwriter Thanks for the shout, Alex. Much appreciated.
1469400578103123974 2021-12-10 20:16:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoshMcKain Nice! That's what I hoped.
1469399291529773061 2021-12-10 20:11:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trainedwright Thanks for reading it. Appreciate it!
1469381601897455618 2021-12-10 19:00:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thecorsta Thanks man! Happy holidays.
1469366841323790346 2021-12-10 18:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're a startup operator, you likely have the skills for entrepreneurship.  If you fail, you'll probably fail right back into the same game.  2022 is a great year to test this hypothesis.
1469362525317832707 2021-12-10 17:45:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cedriclee77 @ayushtweetshere @arvidkahl @MeetKevon @thisiskp_ There are very few people building in public on LinkedIn. Sounds like an opportunity to me.  I did this with my second-most recent course and did over $40k in sales during the build phase. Definitely worth it.
1469362259034050562 2021-12-10 17:43:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedankoe @rufaimunye @BrianFeroldi @warikoo @aaraalto @JamesonCamp Much appreciated 💪
1469317710626672640 2021-12-10 14:46:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshfrank Welcome to the team. It's a different platform with different ups/downs but it's great for building an audience...
1469102891294240776 2021-12-10 00:33:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mynameis_davis God damn. This is hilarious. 😂
1469093150568464390 2021-12-09 23:54:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro True fans, yes. Obviously, the more, the better.
1469089468464435200 2021-12-09 23:39:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Not a shabby goal.
1469088397436334080 2021-12-09 23:35:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ash_lmb Used to be Gumroad, but now I pipe people from Gumroad to Teachable for a better experience.   Teachable's checkout page has way too many fields.
1469087817150124042 2021-12-09 23:33:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The successful solopreneur playbook:  - One niche - 100 true fans - One massive problem - One systematized solution  Stop overcomplicating it.
1469040034603061250 2021-12-09 20:23:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tim_Denning I think we were going to find some time. Shoot me a note to justinwelsh@hey.com and let's grab some time in the new year?
1469036563510497281 2021-12-09 20:09:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tim_Denning Awesome takeaways, Tim. I'm going to be adding a few things into my arsenal in 2022. Not sure what yet, but excited to report back.
1469005930553647104 2021-12-09 18:08:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> And that's it for today.  If you found this thread valuable:  1. Toss me a follow for more threads on entrepreneurship and internet income → @justinsaas  2. Enjoyed this? Here’s another similar thread of mine you might enjoy:  https://t.co/P06K4A084k
1469005928154509320 2021-12-09 18:08:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> - No 30-day email course. - No complicated integrations. - No audience segmentation. - No abandoned cart emails.  None of these things are bad btw.   They would probably help me increase sales.  But they aren't necessary to start &amp; be successful.  So I hope you'll get started...
1469005924622913542 2021-12-09 18:07:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Create an army of happy customers who sell  After completing the course, customers receive an invite to become an affiliate.  It doesn't drive a ton of sales, but so far I've made $5,760 in 5 months.  Not bad.  https://t.co/T709iB6W16
1469005902539890688 2021-12-09 18:07:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Automate testimonials  When the course is completed, I embed a  https://t.co/DNeY0WF8u7 button inside of the last lesson.  The ask is simple. A short video or text testimonial.  Then it automatically gets pumped to my landing page.  Check it out:  https://t.co/QkTjmWgunS
1469005899243130881 2021-12-09 18:07:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Deliver 100x value  Part of the "impulse buy" strategy is to surprise and delight the customer.  "I spent 2k on a Copywriting coach in January... Learned more in this $150 course than I did working with them." - Jubal Horton  This the feedback I'm after 👆🏻  https://t.co/FukPqz7vBi
1469005880578523136 2021-12-09 18:07:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Create urgency with discounts  A simple 25% to 40% expiring discount (24 hours only) drives purchases.  A well-crafted ask + impulse pricing + expiring deal = sales  I average about $14k in 24 hours when I ask.   It gets seen by 50k to 80k people.  https://t.co/HFbOePOmS2
1469005866619883527 2021-12-09 18:07:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ "Impulse buy" pricing  The amount of trust you need to build to sell a $1,297 masterclass takes is insane.  When people come across my products (especially on "ask" days), I want them to "pull the trigger" without thinking.  Make it easy.  $50 to $150  https://t.co/a00I6IuA2V
1469005812911808514 2021-12-09 18:07:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ 80% give, 20% ask  As you continue giving away valuable information, you earn the right to make an "ask".  Once per week, I ask my audience to buy a course.  I make about 15x the revenue each "ask day".  See @gumroad  screenshot (a few more asks bc of Holiday sales)  https://t.co/u8euqwuIT7
1469005791583735826 2021-12-09 18:07:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Continuous value in a niche  I spent a few years on LinkedIn talking about social media growth on the platform.  All of my best lessons already exist as content. They are all free.  The good news is people will pay for aggregation.
1468985397900451841 2021-12-09 16:46:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aakashg0 @LBacaj @daretorant @will_mannon @AnaAlexandraZ Thank you, my man.
1468933482718052359 2021-12-09 13:20:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Thursday to everyone nailing the basics.
1468666235990773769 2021-12-08 19:38:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_v3 I was confused by what subscriptions for my notion pages meant. I can charge for subscriptions? Create subscriptions using notion? I can pay for notion as a subscription?  Obviously I figured it out but it took 5-7 seconds.
1468663376704380935 2021-12-08 19:26:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caan_al I get to some pages and I’m like…what IS this?
1468658169253666817 2021-12-08 19:06:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 99% of landing pages I see don't clearly tell me:  - Who you help - What you help them do - How you help them do it  Too much clever.  Not enough clarity.
1468656346325295106 2021-12-08 18:58:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth You missed my “Lane Kiffin short tenure” joke. Damn.
1468652405298454530 2021-12-08 18:43:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Man. What a cool season that would be.   Who would you hire the next year?

1468602318199402497 2021-12-08 15:24:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneDessai Write for one, distribute to many. But try to understand the nuances of each channel.
1468599146349314053 2021-12-08 15:11:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro @Quora Haha. Had 280 characters and eliminated Quora. Great call, man.
1468598658795028487 2021-12-08 15:09:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The number of places solopreneurs can promote their business is wild:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - HackerNews - Indie Hackers - Facebook Groups - Private Slack/Discord  If you're distributing to one channel, please repurpose.  Different customers hang in different channels.
1468589732082946075 2021-12-08 14:34:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @dingraps You did it! 😂
1468571849726603269 2021-12-08 13:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Wednesday to everyone treating failures as data points.
1468390458619531264 2021-12-08 01:22:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arteeninLA I haven't, to be honest. @danmartell might know of something...
1468327077229309956 2021-12-07 21:10:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst What people often see is the second act. A successful person surrounded by other successful people. Therefore they assume it's who you know.  What they neglect is path that led them there. And that is very often dictated by what you know and how willing you were to learn.
1468303374961754112 2021-12-07 19:36:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SahilBloom How could I not? Keep the 🔥 content coming, Sahil.

1468290261725949954 2021-12-07 18:44:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GraemeCrawley_ Absolutely. I appreciate you spending some time reading it, Graeme. Cheers.

1468046741714919428 2021-12-07 02:36:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesonCamp I'm with ya.  Own a niche, and build a portfolio of products.   Start by delivering incredible value at a low price to set the tone.   Gradually increase prices as people learn you're serious about rooting for their success and supporting it with great products.
1468039494448336899 2021-12-07 02:07:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @benmarsteau @dvassallo @JamesonCamp I no longer have a professional profile. Just my creator profile. Before, I used content to drive with the profile focused on SaaS.

1467956132836741122 2021-12-06 20:36:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FahadHassan That's not necessarily true.  In my last business, we listened to prospective customers and then built a software product.   We never built a service business...
1467936960383754244 2021-12-06 19:20:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LearnEveryyDay Sure thing.  Lots of careers (for example, carpenter) have a pretty standard path.   Many (for example, content creator) can be reached through thousands of different, varying paths.  That's why a step-by-step "how to" guide is much less valuable when things are less predictable
1467923451096748033 2021-12-06 18:26:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adam_dimitrov Yep. Or treating Twitter (or another platform) as a place where people can come and learn a lot about a specific topic.
1467918363556986882 2021-12-06 18:06:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The less predictable your career path, the less helpful "how-to" advice is.   Becoming a carpenter has a pretty straight-line path.  Becoming a professional content creator doesn't.  Don't follow someone else's step-by-step guide only to find out their luck isn't on your side.
1467914925234348038 2021-12-06 17:52:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CharlesWeill Thanks, Charles!
1467885554255622145 2021-12-06 15:56:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TazBurwaiss I think servicing clients 1:1 first means a much more robust and relevant product.
1467885434223181834 2021-12-06 15:55:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mar15sa @remoteworkprep This is exactly how I built my business as well.
1467885340853784584 2021-12-06 15:55:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GraemeCrawley_ I think that would be a broad statement so probably not, but businesses in a similar niche likely do.   I think learning how to solve those individual challenges 1:1 with a client is the perfect lead in to a product.
1467876364040687625 2021-12-06 15:19:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Serve and listen.   Once you fully understand the appropriate solution, productization becomes significantly easier.
1467870075768254467 2021-12-06 14:54:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thenocodepro Because you better understand the challenges your prospective customers have.
1467869647131365377 2021-12-06 14:52:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Counterintuitive observation:  Building a service business is a great way to eventually build a product business.

1467538288965820417 2021-12-05 16:56:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The best marketing for solopreneurs is bringing people on your journey.   If you're doing interesting things offline and not sharing them online, you're losing customers.

1467252838778781696 2021-12-04 22:01:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesSAlberts Yep. It’s that people can’t fluidly transition from one task to another without losing steam.   Prep, follow up, getting back in the groove, checking social, email, grabbing a drink of water, etc.   Deep focus is so necessary.
1467177693951283205 2021-12-04 17:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Time management 101 for solopreneurs:  Keep context switching to a minimum.  30-minute meetings end up costing you 1.5 hours.  The deeper you get into your business, the more important it is to be wise with your time.  Write out templates for saying no to anything.

1466121451191345155 2021-12-01 19:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 steps to eliminate bad prospects from your business:  1. Raise your rates 2. Make pricing transparent 3. Provide a robust FAQ document 4. Charge $$ for your discovery calls  Your volume may go down, but your show rate, win rate, and the average contract value will all go up.

1464670665118781443 2021-11-27 19:01:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Because I write online each day, I've:  - Become an LP - Landed clients - Met new friends - Built 3 digital products - Done hundreds of podcasts - Built a private community of 500+  I have no idea what each piece of content will do.  But it's basically 100% upside.  Publish.
1464666872159379465 2021-11-27 18:46:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @goodideasspread I'm not suggesting someone just go say "I'm a logo designer".   I'm suggesting that as a brand designer, designing logos is a way to make money online.  Just like designing anything else. Simply examples.
1464637710656843778 2021-11-27 16:50:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CryptoDevBunny I have a very different experience with good creators.   I've found them to be really helpful.

1463194441427132416 2021-11-23 17:15:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattboneal @tobi We all have such interesting stories...  Being able to tell them in a way that resonates with your customer is so critical.   Thanks for shedding some light on the Shopify story.  Going to go read it now.
1463192452605657090 2021-11-23 17:07:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArrigoLupori Thanks, Arrigo. It was a really helpful framework for me to go through for sure...
1463189668032393231 2021-11-23 16:56:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Awesome. Thanks for giving it a read, man. Appreciated.
1463189304780414976 2021-11-23 16:54:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jashan_lallar Thanks for recapping, Jashan 💪
1463188503395807243 2021-11-23 16:51:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Practicing yours using the 7 steps gives you a consistent answer to the "tell us your backstory" question.  It's great for:  - Content - Podcasts - Webinars - Your "about" section - Sharing with prospects  When you get it right, it's a massive sales &amp; marketing asset.
1463188499629330437 2021-11-23 16:51:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Telling a compelling story isn't just for startup founders, though.  It's for anyone building a business online.  And everyone who has a story you admire has absolutely crafted it.  Here's a simple cheat sheet you can reference when you're putting yours together:  https://t.co/TI3Nr76eC2
1463188484601094145 2021-11-23 16:51:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ The Result  The result is the continuation of the story to even greater success, leading up to your present situation.  My example: I never looked back. I got promoted multiple times and went on to become an executive at a startup company in LA at age 33.
1463188453718433806 2021-11-23 16:51:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ The Guide  The guide in the story is the person who lifts you up and helps you see your potential for what it really is.  My example: After years of making no sales in my previous jobs, my boss Ryan went out with me on my first day and helped me make a sale.
1463188447343042560 2021-11-23 16:51:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ The Spark  The spark is that magic moment when you realize everything is about to change.  When you went from feeling completely disconnected to reinvigorated.  My example: When I started working at ZocDoc, I was sparked by the product, the people, and the energy of the city.
1463188441185890304 2021-11-23 16:51:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ The Change Event  The change event is the critical decision you made that leads you from your struggle to your newfound transformation.  My example: I took a bus ride from Allentown, Pennsylvania to New York City to interview at a small technology company called ZocDoc.
1463188432948285449 2021-11-23 16:51:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ The External Struggles  External struggles can be seen or heard.   An over-drafted bank account, a lost job, a poor living situation.  My example: My buddies made fun of me for living in tiny towns &amp; getting fired.   A girlfriend even dumped me because I had too much debt.
1463188430804897807 2021-11-23 16:51:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ The Internal Struggles  Internal struggles are how we feel inside because of the obstacle above.  Internal pain is captured with words like fearful, insecure, or worried.  My example: After getting fired 3x, I was worried that I was never going to be successful at anything.
1463188424349962240 2021-11-23 16:51:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ The Obstacle  To start, it's important that your audience can relate to your story.  And there's one critical thing that's relatable to anyone:  Overcoming an obstacle.  My example: I got fired 3 times by the time I was 28 and was basically a failure heading into 2010.
1463188416649211905 2021-11-23 16:51:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The greatest founders in the world all have something in common.  A "founder story" that's a massive marketing asset.  Follow this 7-step framework to create yours...  [🧵thread]
1463142309739085828 2021-11-23 13:48:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chadmmiles Nice! I love that man. So pumped to hear you’re making it happen together.
1463136996772220933 2021-11-23 13:26:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AnanthKoov Tons of hard work. Like anything great, it takes hard work and patience to make it happen.
1463135055182712834 2021-11-23 13:19:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Tuesday to everyone making their first dollar online.
1462948105490518018 2021-11-23 00:56:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkModesti Anything worth doing takes a lot of work for sure.   If you get it right, you’ll wake up to more daily income than most people make going to their 9 to 5.
1462904793098293252 2021-11-22 22:04:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VladPasca5 Definitely. If I write 3%, everyone has a conniption, though.
1462888274649878528 2021-11-22 20:58:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danthewolfe Yep. It's a lot less anxiety-inducing when you break it down to the nitty-gritty.
1462888172002680839 2021-11-22 20:58:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SelimChehimi No, LinkedIn.   I have a much larger following there.   https://t.co/2q0HmOU9mR
1462883012840984585 2021-11-22 20:37:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SelimChehimi I operate at a roughly 98% margin.   I do zero paid ads (never have) and have a few hundred bucks per month in technology costs.  Mostly, it's just my time.
1462881809994244101 2021-11-22 20:32:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pedr0luna I'd recommend you start with a service business, then productize.   https://t.co/mfPl5C9F05
1462873811766890502 2021-11-22 20:01:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Making $200k/yr selling info products broken down:  - $16.7k per month - Which is ~$540/day - Which is 4 customers @ $135/ea - Which is 285 daily web visitors at 1.4% conversion  None of this is easy.  But it's certainly easier than staring $200k in the face without a plan.
1462784926953218048 2021-11-22 14:07:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AByteOfCodeAlex Agreed.

1462504558970781696 2021-11-21 19:33:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @biz84 Definitely doesn't come easy.  Can come a bit easier if we realize this, though...
1462497577190965260 2021-11-21 19:06:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People vastly underestimate the value of their knowledge.  Publish yours and be pleasantly surprised.

1461779344796311555 2021-11-19 19:32:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You won't do anything special without a little risk.  Those at the top of their fields nearly always took some small risks.  - The idea - The execution - The go-to-market - The advertising plan  Don't be catastrophically foolish.  But take some well-calculated chances.
1461748455773290507 2021-11-19 17:29:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mijustin @dvassallo That makes sense.  I was thinking more about social progress versus progress related to design and planning, but I certainly understand your point.
1461746223954735105 2021-11-19 17:20:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @mijustin Devil's advocate:  By slowing progress to address consequences, we simply shift the consequences toward those who are desperate for faster progress.  Note: I'm neither a conservative nor a progressive.

1461409410157355026 2021-11-18 19:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Life gets easier once you realize the entrepreneurs you admire are just like you.  A more consistent, curious, &amp; less risk-averse version of you.  So, if you want to join them, you only have 2 options:  - A: Get started. - B: Don't.  Option A is scary, but option B is scarier.

1461384144827699202 2021-11-18 17:21:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 5: Stay consistent  Writing consistently is the most important step of all.  Here's the TL;DR:  • Ideate with topics/structures • Format with tools like Typeshare • Edit with tools like Hemingway • Distribute with tools like HypeFury
1461384143535853571 2021-11-18 17:21:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 4: Distribute widely  99% of people I talk to waste distribution opportunities.  You've already written something.   Why not share it everywhere that's relevant?  I use @Hypefury to send my content to Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.  The tool is powerful.  https://t.co/YKNil9PJsL
1461384140461428745 2021-11-18 17:21:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 3: Edit ruthlessly  No easier way to lose a reader than unclear writing.  So, once I'm done, I pass my writing through @HemingwayApp  It tells me:  - The grade level - Poor word choices - Poor sentence structure  Paste in your writing and see where you can simplify.  https://t.co/drBmGUwC7U
1461384135495270404 2021-11-18 17:21:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 2: Choose a solid format  Struggling to format your writing?  There are so many tools out there to help.  I am loving @typeshare_co  They have beautiful templates built right in for inspiration.  No better way to get started.  https://t.co/5EhrScjNWe
1461384130869014537 2021-11-18 17:21:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 1: Ideate rapidly  What’s the fastest way to come up with ideas?  Use systems.  I created my own content matrix in Notion.  - Choose a topic - Match it to a style - Write a quick headline - Repeat until you have 10 ideas  Much of writing is about systems.  https://t.co/HVdg7myRZf
1461384126762786818 2021-11-18 17:21:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Back in late 2018, I had never written anything online.  Fast forward 3 years, and I passed 100M impressions.  What most people don’t know?  I use the same process to write every time.  A short 🧵
1461378789305470983 2021-11-18 17:00:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LeighNeys @jasonvana @jspector @dickiebush @ameliasordell Thank you, Leigh! 🔥
1461344064922603521 2021-11-18 14:42:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DanTAhn @jmcmillen89 @dickiebush @ship30for30 I've heard. I'm super interested in what he's doing.   Will likely join the cohort but not just to do research.  I also want to continue to get better at writing...
1461341274984882178 2021-11-18 14:31:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Mostly investing in better infrastructure (currently using multiple tools vs. all-in-one) and employing people to help improve and retain engagement.   The community space is difficult.  I have a hypothesis that most communities will never be worth the work effort.
1461340589555949570 2021-11-18 14:28:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Itsrickjohnston Thanks, Rick! Much appreciated.
1461340430289850375 2021-11-18 14:28:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NotechAna - @SlackHQ (sync convo) - @LumaHQ (directory/events) - @crowdcastHQ (video) - @outseta (CRM and management)
1461340022041423872 2021-11-18 14:26:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @founderemils 100% there is an enormous opp here.
1461339785163952139 2021-11-18 14:25:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @McdonnellCallum I did move, yes.  People struggled with the threading in Discord and their solution to threads is terrible.
1461339667345858561 2021-11-18 14:25:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dagorenouf Thanks, man.  The community is certainly one of the more time-consuming and difficult things I run.   There is no easy button for communities.
1461324383625043970 2021-11-18 13:24:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Thursday to everyone helping people help people.
1461122057232699407 2021-11-18 00:00:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MightyNetworks Oh nice! I'm interested in learning more for sure.
1461121977402470409 2021-11-18 00:00:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays Thanks, my man!
1461082355385384969 2021-11-17 21:22:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks A tool called @outseta which I use to run my community. It's awesome.
1461076818052669444 2021-11-17 21:00:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto Thank you, Aaron. Been a wild and interesting ride for sure.
1461071600833413122 2021-11-17 20:39:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SachinRamje @arvidkahl This is excellent, Sachin.
1461062729041600521 2021-11-17 20:04:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @umut_sonmez It’s 100% a unicorn idea. Anyone want to build it with me?
1461062348664360968 2021-11-17 20:03:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena @circleapp It doesn’t really have synchronous conversation but it’s getting there.
1461061590426562566 2021-11-17 20:00:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Well...that's all for today's thread.  If this was helpful at all, feel free to give me a follow or RT.   I tweet about building no-code businesses towards $5M.  Have any questions? Drop them below👇🏻  Thanks for reading.
1461061585368231939 2021-11-17 20:00:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ You must market hard  I don't just mean to get people onto your waitlist, or interested.   I mean marketing to people who have already expressed interest.  People are busy. They forget to apply. They forget to pay.  72-hour, 24-hour, and 2-hour reminders work wonders.
1461061579689148423 2021-11-17 20:00:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ The community software space needs help  If you want synchronous conversation, you're left hacking together a bunch of tools.  - Member directory - Resource center - Events - Real-time conversation  IMO, there is not a single company doing all of this extremely well.
1461061575419351040 2021-11-17 19:59:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ It's rewarding  We already have hundreds of member wins and stories of new business being closed.  People are seeing dramatic growth in their social media following and pipeline.  It feels amazing to be helping people that put their trust in me.
1461061572156170251 2021-11-17 19:59:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ It's time-consuming.  I spend 8-10 hours per day working in the community, which is a lot given the current MRR.  The upside is that more members don't necessarily equal more work.   As this scales, I believe community management will provide me with more time.
1461061540875022347 2021-11-17 19:59:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Synchronous conversation is intense.  We chose Discord (then Slack) because I had a hypothesis that synchronous conversation would be important.  It seems to be proving true so far, but there are complaints about it being overwhelming.  I wish I had done more research.
1461061537867735053 2021-11-17 19:59:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Early culture is key  We put people through a robust application process to deeply understand who they are.  We set expectations 3x on who should join and who shouldn't.   We emphasized the importance of creativity, participation, etc.  Our first 4 cohorts are amazing.
1461061535443390471 2021-11-17 19:59:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Outcomes matter  It's critical that everyone is focused on the same outcome.  I have 130k followers on LinkedIn, so some people applied just to hang out.  Those members don't engage as much because the outcomes we're working towards aren't why they joined.   Be thorough.
1461061531211374594 2021-11-17 19:59:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My private community just passed $11k MRR in 6 months.  Thinking of creating your own community?  Here are my top 7 learnings:  [🧵thread]  https://t.co/rSYC2DScO6
1460969914659921924 2021-11-17 13:55:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona I do, and my favorite is the automation that powers my advising business. AirTable + Zapier + Gmail + Stripe
1460967743960895489 2021-11-17 13:47:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona Heyooo
1460961981553422342 2021-11-17 13:24:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Wednesday to everyone recapturing their time through automation.

1460761268055384068 2021-11-17 00:06:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lifewithzak @aaraalto Appreciate your support, Zak.
1460759729119145985 2021-11-17 00:00:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cedric_design It's not about follower number, IMO. It's about signals from your audience. Once you start to get the same question multiple times over, you know you're getting somewhere.  There is no hard and fast rule, just signals inside of the noise.
1460758932000018435 2021-11-16 23:57:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PedroElEstoico I'm way ahead of you. 🍻

1460697489913298949 2021-11-16 19:53:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yakirhirsch Welcome, Yakir. Thanks for reading.
1460697385500348418 2021-11-16 19:52:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StansellAndrew Sure. I grew a nice following on LinkedIn back in 2019. I did 10-15 coaching calls to really learn what problems people had. Then I took all of those problems and put them into two courses, which have now grossed over $300,000 in sales in 18 months.
1460687953395597322 2021-11-16 19:15:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @William3Willis 1. Fear 2. Overcomplication 3. Choosing technology  I get lost in a lot of those things. It's when I keep it simple that I usually perform best.
1460687817919578115 2021-11-16 19:14:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Pranjaltweeets Much appreciated, Pranjal. Thank you.
1460687751876075524 2021-11-16 19:14:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morkly_othniel I'm so glad it was helpful, Othniel. Thanks for reading it.
1460687653872021516 2021-11-16 19:14:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JSeym0ur Expertise is so subjective.  High school math teachers aren't usually world-renowned mathematicians. They just know more than their students.  That's how I view coaching/teaching.
1460674595967672325 2021-11-16 18:22:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VCTweeting Much appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read it. 🙌
1460673724013809665 2021-11-16 18:18:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Chantyy86 That's amazing. Glad to hear you did that, Santiago. Keep pressing the gas down. 🔥
1460670959229280257 2021-11-16 18:07:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvainrub I'd probably spend my time in places like @makerpad and @IndieHackers or on Reddit threads with no-coders.  Talk to them about their challenges and see if what you're building solves them.  Doesn't mean they'll buy. But it's a signal.  Then, build a lean, cheap, fast MVP to test.
1460669305071284226 2021-11-16 18:01:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @diego5flores Appreciate you sharing, Diego 💪
1460668246206648323 2021-11-16 17:57:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneDessai Great question. A better word for "no-brainer" is "impulse buy".   If something is mildly interesting to me and it's $50, I'll probably buy it on impulse. If it's $250, I won't.  I think $30-$99 is a good "impulse buy" range.
1460666124173987840 2021-11-16 17:48:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kevinbooyens It's a great way to simply get started. You can evolve very easily over time, which is great.
1460666088442806272 2021-11-16 17:48:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VladPasca5 Appreciate you reading it, Vlad!
1460666046168412163 2021-11-16 17:48:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JohnathanBarnes Yes, this is exactly how I do it.   Coaching is hourly, one-off stuff and consulting/advising is retainer based.
1460663419636432900 2021-11-16 17:37:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LearnEveryyDay Thank you, Jason. Appreciate you sharing it.
1460658209111396354 2021-11-16 17:17:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Get started.   👆🏻That's the key  If this was helpful, feel free to RT or give me a follow.  I'm  building 4, one-person businesses to over $5M in revenue.  Have any questions? Ask away.   Happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading.
1460658206875729929 2021-11-16 17:17:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ Set up your systems  - Create useful content - Drive people to the product - Upsell 1:1 coaching packages  With this simple system it's only a matter of time before you add a 3rd income stream:  - Consulting - Community - Physical products - Cohort-based coaching  Next?
1460658204837392394 2021-11-16 17:17:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/ Raise your rates  With a lower-priced product, you can now increase your coaching rates.  When people want coaching, you can coach.  When they don't, tell them about your digital product.  You now have an offering for different learning styles and price points.
1460658202626899973 2021-11-16 17:17:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Build a digital product  Your 2nd income stream is your first digital product. Focused on the most common problem above.  Take someone from problem to solution in 45 minutes or less.  Keep it focused.  Single problem → single solution  Price it reasonably to build trust.
1460658200534032392 2021-11-16 17:17:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Listen for commonalities  This is a key step to creating your 2nd income stream.  Your goal when coaching is to listen for the most common problems of your students.  - Write down every problem you hear - Dive deeper to understand them - Keep a running list  This is the gold.
1460658198411632652 2021-11-16 17:17:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Promote it  It's unlikely you'll get clients just because your business exists.  Instead, find easy ways to promote it.  When your new followers ask you questions, tell them about your coaching business.  When you write content, share a link at the end.  Simple stuff.
1460658195337293830 2021-11-16 17:17:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Create a service business  A simple coaching business can be your 1st income stream.  Put up an MVP landing page and use @stripe to collect payments.  The key? Make the pricing a no-brainer.  You're not looking to get rich here, you're looking to learn. (more on this)
1460658157081051140 2021-11-16 17:16:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Create content  Next, it's time to establish credibility.  Here are some easy ways:  - Teardowns - Tweet threads - Step-by-step guides  Show the people 2-3 years behind you that you understand their challenges &amp; have solved them before.  This will gain you a small following.
1460658154102996999 2021-11-16 17:16:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Find the "you" from 2-3 years ago  Your goal is to find people who are just like you, but much earlier in their journey.  Where do they hang out online? Try places like:  - Reddit - Twitter - LinkedIn - FB Groups  If you can't find them, use tools like @sparktoro to help.
1460658129637720070 2021-11-16 17:16:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Identify your interests  Inside of the list you just created, will be things you loved doing and hated doing.  Sorry, but misery doesn't scale.  Choose something you built skills in, that you also enjoy doing/talking about/writing about.  This will be your focus.
1460658122624802824 2021-11-16 17:16:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Eliminate the "fallacy of expertise"  When you get started, you can't worry about "am I an expert?"  If you do, you'll never get started.  Instead, make a list of your accomplishments, big and small, over the last 2-3 years.  What skills did you learn during this period?

1460295977605242886 2021-11-15 17:17:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant It’s important and often forgotten.
1460295256587522048 2021-11-15 17:14:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMKhateeb You nailed it, man. Can’t think of a better way to describe it than this.
1460295124966117388 2021-11-15 17:14:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jkristobans Same here. It’s one of the toughest lessons to learn.
1460295023820517378 2021-11-15 17:13:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ImraneDessai It certainly can.
1460292591350599683 2021-11-15 17:04:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don't sell a digital product without building some credibility.  Instead:  - Figure out who you love spending time with - Talk to them about their challenges - Learn how to solve them - Share what you learn - Repeat  Do this, and you'll build a wonderful reputation.  Then sell.
1460256827917144073 2021-11-15 14:42:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @domm Love seeing my hometown embracing technology and thinking forward.   Nice work, @domm   Massive congrats.
1460239536693338113 2021-11-15 13:33:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growwithsahil 💯 Happy Monday, my man.
1460239455344803845 2021-11-15 13:33:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ItsBogdi It’s amazing how networking has shifted and changed.   The possibilities are now endless.
1460239314848206851 2021-11-15 13:32:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pheadrick Same. What a massive reduction in time and expenses.
1460237202739367937 2021-11-15 13:24:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Monday to everyone collaborating with people they've never met IRL.
1460066584664453121 2021-11-15 02:06:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup This is one of the best things I’ve read in a long time.   (Translation: this resonates)  Well done.
1459931460031365128 2021-11-14 17:09:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mr_M_E @MoneyGrowthBiz Thank you my man!
1459897112565624832 2021-11-14 14:52:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena Love it, Melissa. I’m working to look through the same lens.
1459891457876185104 2021-11-14 14:30:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency Thank you for the nice feature, my man. 🙌
1459889172626427908 2021-11-14 14:21:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Sunday to entrepreneurs bouncing back from a failure.
1459602321462210562 2021-11-13 19:21:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ash_lmb Absolutely, Ash.
1459597131531096065 2021-11-13 19:00:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat I absolutely love that.  I did the same at previous roles. Some people never made it, some people became CEOs. They all view me as someone who helped them...
1459595959726444545 2021-11-13 18:56:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Entrepreneurship so often feels like a Karma game.  I'm convinced that helping others over the course of your career is the single greatest investment you can make.  Those that succeeded without this are the exception, not the rule.
1459555620764454917 2021-11-13 16:15:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Massive thanks for including me here, Aadit.
1459532079390240780 2021-11-13 14:42:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn I'm looking to add a new revenue stream soon.
1459532006107365382 2021-11-13 14:42:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MentalWeapons Ha. Glad I managed to make it happen.
1459526773855641606 2021-11-13 14:21:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Saturday to everyone using the internet to fire themselves from their job.
1459249156724334592 2021-11-12 19:58:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LeighNeys Anything Sandler-related is great for fundamentals and best practices.  Challenger Sale is really great as well.
1459246393290330116 2021-11-12 19:47:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Umm...  https://t.co/8vLbe2Ql24
1459227373740638211 2021-11-12 18:31:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenpratley @pauldm @tanyamoushi Gumroad was always my choice because there is almost no friction in getting started. Teachable requires building out the page and what not.
1459217436071313414 2021-11-12 17:52:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LofbergHenrik @ArrigoLupori Try starting with learning Sandler selling. It has a lot of fundamentals that work extremely well.
1459208136166977538 2021-11-12 17:15:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArrigoLupori And once technical founders realize that learning sales is a lot like learning other skills, it becomes less intimidating.
1459207483646525451 2021-11-12 17:12:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jkristobans Absolutely. You must.
1459207410753720326 2021-11-12 17:12:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Denis__Shatalin @NotechAna @Natalie_Furn @bubble @nocodelife @JelmerPe @HainingMax @5harath I absolutely love that, and I greatly appreciate the offer. I'll likely take you up on that.  Thank you.
1459174757383999514 2021-11-12 15:02:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Denis__Shatalin @NotechAna @Natalie_Furn @bubble @nocodelife @JelmerPe @HainingMax @5harath Unclear at the moment, tbh.
1459165548227530771 2021-11-12 14:25:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto I'm so excited that you launched this. I could feel your stress on launch day/night, through the computer!
1459159843860885516 2021-11-12 14:03:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tgs0376 Well, shit. Thanks, man. 🙌
1459155288162979848 2021-11-12 13:45:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena I'll never understand those who root for others to fail. It's a karma game out here.
1459155214037049344 2021-11-12 13:44:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pslearn_io Such a great way to say focused.
1459155164535963656 2021-11-12 13:44:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn Right back at you, man.
1459150021417385989 2021-11-12 13:24:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Friday to entrepreneurs hitting MRR milestones.  Watching you build your freedom in real-time is electric.
1458877093727637505 2021-11-11 19:19:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StephenFerrin @growthcurrency @ShaanVP Appreciate you! 🤛
1458875436243595271 2021-11-11 19:13:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @melissa_scatena True story, Melissa.
1458875405847474177 2021-11-11 19:12:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pslearn_io Never learned more...
1458875378555047945 2021-11-11 19:12:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aflorescpywrtr Take action. Listen. Iterate. Repeat.
1458875338189115406 2021-11-11 19:12:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackseyy Pretty simple.
1458875313358839822 2021-11-11 19:12:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SaaSTux Nailed it. Do things in reality, solve problems you only imagined.
1458875246984019976 2021-11-11 19:12:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrookeTansley Ha. Love that. The less you scare yourself, the more likely you are to start.
1458872691776237572 2021-11-11 19:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> All those questions you have about entrepreneurship get answered when you just start.
1458799487921577985 2021-11-11 14:11:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aakashg0 Literally, the truest.
1458794895137808389 2021-11-11 13:53:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MattMHarriman Call in the sitter!
1458794795439214595 2021-11-11 13:52:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn My favorite days, and I've got them back-to-back.
1458794394937704453 2021-11-11 13:51:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Thursday to everyone with a clear calendar because they learned to say no.
1458546394067881993 2021-11-10 21:25:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VCBrags Nice fit. Rocking it proudly.
1458546331891519490 2021-11-10 21:25:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aflorescpywrtr @VCBrags Thanks, Arnold!
1458546308315328525 2021-11-10 21:25:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor @VCBrags I don't believe so. I think it's a custom piece that Jennifer picked out.
1458541411075346432 2021-11-10 21:05:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If this is what you get for writing Twitter threads, I’m gonna keep writing.   Thanks for the swag, @VCBrags 👏👏👏  https://t.co/btch1DkClQ
1458520722427494405 2021-11-10 19:43:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaakkojar You're probably right, but once you figure it out...
1458515441341566990 2021-11-10 19:22:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Once you learn how to build a simple business that generates $4k to $5k per month, it becomes so much easier to replicate and handoff, replicate and handoff.
1458510809919889414 2021-11-10 19:04:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you can create one $50k business, you can probably create 10.
1458479813681889285 2021-11-10 17:00:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ratfink6923 @michaelaubry I wish there was a community tool built specifically for synchronous communities.  Once you choose Slack or Discord as your communication platform of choice, you're left cobbling together a bunch of other pieces to support it.
1458219463325765637 2021-11-09 23:46:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @t_recsch @gumroad No.
1458214520388833281 2021-11-09 23:26:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TractionConf_io Absolutely. Shoot me a note to justinwelsh@hey.com   Thanks for reaching out.

1458188428642762754 2021-11-09 21:43:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nonstack Appreciate that, man!
1458164441401417728 2021-11-09 20:07:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nonstack @outseta Here's a really good article written by @GeoffTRoberts that goes deep into how I use Outseta.   https://t.co/EAvITZI64v
1458147989650821127 2021-11-09 19:02:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MakadiaHarsh Awesome list!
1458147921799663622 2021-11-09 19:02:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mehulkapadia_7 Thanks for reading it!
1458128695936307206 2021-11-09 17:45:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DewJ72458282 Nearly all of these tools have free versions and paid versions.  Most of them are around $15ish per month if you want the paid versions.  The most expensive one is $70/month.
1458127496881319947 2021-11-09 17:41:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VladPasca5 Thanks for reading, Vlad!
1458123359221395459 2021-11-09 17:24:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MattNBenson Significantly less. I just took last week off to travel and didn't do a single client meeting.
1458121953387204615 2021-11-09 17:18:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Let's get me in there...I'll sign up today.
1458121439060578305 2021-11-09 17:16:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @therahmanashiq Appreciate it, Ashiqur!
1458121383582609411 2021-11-09 17:16:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen Of course. Your software has been huge for me. 🔥
1458119345725448195 2021-11-09 17:08:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @InspiredByWayne Appreciate you sharing, Wayne!
1458118572715151367 2021-11-09 17:05:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BellKanaar Appreciate you, Kanaar!
1458118494566895619 2021-11-09 17:05:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @saurabhg @zapier I have an entire workflow that supports my advising business. You can find it in this great @makerpad blog that came out the other day.   https://t.co/skrcHjpVDn
1458118272382025735 2021-11-09 17:04:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @usefathom Tryin' 😉
1458118125250129928 2021-11-09 17:03:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bushwik @damengchen Ooh, great add. Thanks, Todd!
1458116068094906371 2021-11-09 16:55:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Well, that's all for today.  If this was helpful, feel free to RT or give me a follow.  I'm currently building 4, one-person businesses to over $5M in revenue.  Have any questions? Ask away.   Happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading.
1458116064768929796 2021-11-09 16:55:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 12/ Zapier  No list would be complete without @zapier   Never has one tool made me feel like the whole world of technology is at my fingertips.  From building simple pass-through Zaps, to complex, multi-step Zaps, Zapier makes anything possible by combining technologies.
1458116063074340867 2021-11-09 16:55:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 11/ Notion  @NotionHQ is basically the master hub for my whole life. In Notion I:  - Host my roadmap - Manage my to-do list - Write all of my content - Store my process docs - And much more...  And I'm still learning how to use it most effectively.
1458116061191102467 2021-11-09 16:55:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ HypeFury  @Yannick_Veys added new features that have recently turned it from good to "I can't live without this".  Scheduling Tweets, crafting threads, being inspired, sending to other social media, running sales...  It does everything for the content writer.  A must-buy.
1458116059224018948 2021-11-09 16:55:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I  Strong testimonials are a great way to improve conversion.  Nothing makes it easier and more impactful than  https://t.co/DNeY0WF8u7  I embed it in my course, and users can leave video/text testimonials that automatically appear on my landing pages.
1458116057139396608 2021-11-09 16:55:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Loom  @loom is my favorite tool for:  - Building video process docs - Building out my online courses - Doing video walkthroughs for my community - Teaching someone how a piece of software works  Simple, easy to install, and tracks visitor/watcher analytics.
1458116055193296909 2021-11-09 16:55:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Fathom Analytics  Looking at Google Analytics can be confusing for some folks.  @usefathom is simple, privacy-first, cookie-free, and GDPR compliant.  Plus, with just a glance, I know exactly what is impacting my website traffic.   Great service.
1458116052764790784 2021-11-09 16:55:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Calendly  @Calendly means I don't need a VA for scheduling, nor do I need any time-consuming back and forth.  Anything that requires scheduling a meeting, a simple Calendly embed works wonders.  I also drop it on my website for paid coaching calls.
1458116050927685639 2021-11-09 16:55:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ AirTable  @airtable keeps my entire advising business thriving and organized.  Collecting information through forms, automating email triggers, building Kanban charts, and collaborating with my wife are just some of the things I love doing to manage my business.
1458116048138424330 2021-11-09 16:55:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Outseta  Thinking about launching a community or SaaS product?   @outseta is your tool.   A CRM, payments, subscriptions, email automation, gated content, segmentation, etc...  Outseta is loaded with great features and functionality at an extremely fair price.
1458116041947729926 2021-11-09 16:55:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Canva  @canva has made me into my own personal graphic designer.  Whether it's Twitter banners, icons, logos, landing page graphics, Instagram posts, you name it...  Canva makes it as easy as drag-and-drop to start designing.
1458116035018739712 2021-11-09 16:55:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Gumroad  For digital products, nothing is easier and faster than @gumroad  I can think of a product/service and have it fully embedded on my Carrd landing page in less than 10 minutes.  This lets me start pre-selling fast to get the validation I need to continue.
1458115997525848076 2021-11-09 16:55:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Carrd  @carrd is the fastest and easiest way to build websites.  It's great for personal sites or standing up landing pages quickly.  I use it for nearly everything I do because it makes getting started extremely simple.
1458115989271371787 2021-11-09 16:55:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I’ve done over $1M in income in 2 years as an entrepreneur.  And I didn't write a single line of code.  My 12 "must use" no-code tools:  [🧵 thread}
1458102497311084545 2021-11-09 16:01:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 "Be authentic" and "add value" are platitudes that require a lot more context.  Owning a niche is where it's at. A niche of one.
1458084103664848896 2021-11-09 14:48:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki You'd better love talking to them and be fully invested in solving their most pressing problems.  If you've got those things, you're going to be in a much better position to succeed long-term.
1458083362887843853 2021-11-09 14:45:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GerardDawson3 Yep. Get it out there and see what people want to know more about.
1458083306038341645 2021-11-09 14:45:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @isthisReda Ship early and often. Increase the surface area of your luck.
1458075002012635143 2021-11-09 14:12:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Tuesday to everyone increasing their luck by shipping often.
1457849078201688065 2021-11-08 23:14:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndyDidorosi I don’t sell to doctors anymore but you’d be surprised.   - reimbursements going down - schedule density at an all-time low - more tech requirements that cost big $$  No promotion = bought by a hospital or beaten by competitors.   2x the work, 50% of the income. Brutal.
1457847923321065473 2021-11-08 23:10:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexgarcia_atx  https://t.co/CkhhJYGFKt
1457812500565594113 2021-11-08 20:49:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sleepy_l0c0 @GeorgeNoble07 I wish I could sell myself that.
1457800926400417793 2021-11-08 20:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Batulkr_ I don’t think that’s the issue at all.   I see plenty of successful entrepreneurs who sell a solution to a pain they never personally went through.   The market eliminates fakers.
1457795396500000768 2021-11-08 19:41:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano Not with the way I approach entrepreneurship.  I'm not trying to build a unicorn.  If I can build 4 companies that do $250k in annual revenue, even if they stay stagnant...I'm pretty happy.
1457795153163259909 2021-11-08 19:40:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trevorgodfrey_ I'm actually writing a thread on my entire no-code stack for tomorrow. Stay tuned and it will be helpful.
1457787791392215043 2021-11-08 19:11:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dougzhotmess The best way to learn is to get started.
1457787724698570765 2021-11-08 19:10:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trevorgodfrey_ Yep. Everything I build is no-code. Just get started quickly and validate the problem/solution.
1457786634707996673 2021-11-08 19:06:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KathWertheim @Uber @lyft As someone who cannot code, all I really think about is tech-enabled services.   If you can build that, the next big idea is just one thought away.
1457785552527265794 2021-11-08 19:02:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChristineCarril The more you can find existing, poorly operated ideas and fix them...the more likely you are to think of that big idea when you least expect it.
1457785414865932291 2021-11-08 19:01:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano Looking at it through this lens has allowed me to see so many new opportunities where I used to see nothing.
1457784276288634882 2021-11-08 18:57:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You don't need a flashy new idea to build a business.  Go find:  - Antiquated industries - Slow companies - Poor service  Use technology to do a better job and you'll likely start chipping away.  A much easier lens to view entrepreneurship through.
1457783680860975108 2021-11-08 18:54:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @derekmertins Always.
1457783632358113280 2021-11-08 18:54:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenpratley It should be so hard, that the customer can't figure it out. Who can?  You.
1457783547121463301 2021-11-08 18:54:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertbalazsi No existential pain, no sale.
1457783476078321668 2021-11-08 18:53:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aflorescpywrtr Yep. I'm most interested in what keeps them up every night.
1457783394226479109 2021-11-08 18:53:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeorgeNoble07 100%. The bigger the pain, the more I'm willing to pay.
1457755863377223683 2021-11-08 17:04:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Too many entrepreneurs are selling products or services for problems they haven't validated as painful.  The more existential the pain, the more people buy.
1457752527416475648 2021-11-08 16:51:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayd3sai @amandanat @ChrisWalker171 @camilletrent @davegerhardt Thank you, my man. Funny enough, I’m most commonly referred to as a marketer. I’ll take it. 👏
1457731133026807809 2021-11-08 15:26:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MXPPPE Thanks for reading it. 🤛
1457709198872023040 2021-11-08 13:58:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mr_M_E Appreciate you, Brian!

1457704711784648707 2021-11-08 13:41:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Love it. Can't wait to see it launch, man.

1457701527066451971 2021-11-08 13:28:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ronyfadel Thank you, Rony. Right back at youl
1457700640101216257 2021-11-08 13:24:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Monday to everyone diversifying their income streams this week.
1457464387669737475 2021-11-07 21:46:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CreateGrowRep Glad to see you’re back on LinkedIn. What a mess.
1457372997837369350 2021-11-07 15:42:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Sunday to those of you building an intentional life through solopreneurship.
1456983044993212418 2021-11-06 13:53:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JayMacFounder Appreciate it, Jay. Happy Sat.
1456982649348804612 2021-11-06 13:51:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Saturday to everyone working to impress themselves, not others.
1456672505058533378 2021-11-05 17:19:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjaythecreator Probably not. Good point.
1456664369866199052 2021-11-05 16:47:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lesgreys Appreciate that, Les. Lmk how it goes!
1456661890998939652 2021-11-05 16:37:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Supreet84421577 I’ve found nearly all advice is contextual.   Universally, I’d say understanding your customers will always get your farther than relying on expert opinions.
1456658084047294465 2021-11-05 16:22:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @disknotifier Don't listen to me, listen to them.
1456658016170876939 2021-11-05 16:21:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @isthisReda Their words certainly matter more than someone without a whole lot of context.
1456655789175754753 2021-11-05 16:12:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Less time listening to experts.   More time listening to customers.
1456612676180848648 2021-11-05 13:21:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Great stuff, Dickie.  Join a few communities and watch for the most common questions.   Dig in, and look for the clear gap in knowledge and then fill it.  Great writers solve problems with clear and concise language and guidance.  Love this.

1456387483919396874 2021-11-04 22:26:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sophietherose Working for myself.
1456359573141524482 2021-11-04 20:35:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @enoch_lambert 1. Saying no frequently 2. Building out automation 3. Lessons in trust and pricing 4. Providing excellent customer service
1456354026463928323 2021-11-04 20:13:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RionMartin Both of mine were VC-backed and the learnings were insane. I learned more than I ever had...until I went out on my own.  Something about working for yourself that forces learning to be so much faster.
1456353161233502213 2021-11-04 20:10:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @frederik_vl 👍🏻
1456336512216358918 2021-11-04 19:04:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I spent 10 years working for entrepreneurs and 2 years being one.   The latter taught me 100x more.
1456322569842446343 2021-11-04 18:08:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DadaMacroSamjho @yadavajay @sharthok_c @sairam2698 @ritendn @megha_panghal @thea_mercs @khushbuu18 @heyanant_ @noman_webdesign @east_wali @dagorenouf Thank you 🙌🏻
1456305784418148356 2021-11-04 17:02:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5 steps to a one-person business:  1. Talk to people 2. Understand what they need 3. Create content that helps them achieve 4. Service them one-on-one to learn solutions 5. Package those solutions into a product over time  Talk → understand → create → service → productize
1456275826572283905 2021-11-04 15:03:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertbalazsi @Natalie_Furn Thanks to both of ya'll. 💪

1456231286683717633 2021-11-04 12:06:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramsri_goutham Amazing work. Keep it going, my man.

1456227321468399616 2021-11-04 11:50:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy Thursday to everyone diversifying their income.

1455971716602212356 2021-11-03 18:54:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdgarSifuentesT Can’t replicate the meetings I’ve had by sitting at home on camera.
1455883610314133505 2021-11-03 13:04:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Absolutely one of the most helpful workshops we've had in the community.  So many actionable takeaways that I'm going to implement for my next digital products.   Thanks again, Matt.
1455692143905935369 2021-11-03 00:23:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yesmrtn Build in public and the writing problem solves itself.

1455611488421490692 2021-11-02 19:03:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SocialQui 100%. Meeting great people through public building is a win.
1455603475300167686 2021-11-02 18:31:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn Great point
1455601350104862723 2021-11-02 18:23:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The upside of building in public:  - More intrigue - More attention - More conversations - Better feedback loop  The downside is what people will think of you.  Once you realize they don't, the downside goes away.
1455566121306890246 2021-11-02 16:03:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeoffTRoberts The whole world is one big marketing funnel. You’re either building one or in one.

1455557546375323648 2021-11-02 15:28:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn @adamspiers Thanks for the kind shout! 💪🏻

1455505781927858178 2021-11-02 12:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonleowsg Had one major thread that drove a lot.
1455281503504588804 2021-11-01 21:12:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Synnovatia A few thousand in revenue that is directly attributable but I'm not worried about bottom line or ROI right now at all.   I'm building for the long game.
1455277959854628884 2021-11-01 20:57:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonsustar Thanks, Jon. Say hello to Molly for me!
1455267148763443217 2021-11-01 20:15:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dayvo_ec Carrd, Stripe, and Airtable so far.
1455254969842556940 2021-11-01 19:26:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Hunckler Gotcha.  1. Don't know, but probably 95%+  I haven't been good at interacting with other accounts. If you look at my recent Tweets, you'll see the engagement comes from them.  2. I don't believe any of it was repurposed. Maybe a few lines here and there, but mostly fresh.
1455251095396225026 2021-11-01 19:11:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Hunckler Do you mean was my content original or repurposed?
1455203946436440070 2021-11-01 16:03:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @philostar I think it's likely that work becomes more fluid. I don't think about it as 4 or 5 days, rather, how do I get my work done successfully?   I don't do polls, but you could try one.
1455203679351476230 2021-11-01 16:02:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort Damn. That's a lot to live up to :)
1455202404996104193 2021-11-01 15:57:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @philostar Tweet every day and stay focused on your target audience.  Every week or so, share a thread that goes deeper into what you've learned/are learning.
1455199143723479044 2021-11-01 15:44:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcesarromero Awesome, appreciate the support, Cesar.
1455196304750096388 2021-11-01 15:33:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LiamKircher #3 is unacceptable.
1455195593173872656 2021-11-01 15:30:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LiamKircher 3 buckets of no shows IMO.  1. Reaches out and says they can't make it: I'll book again.  2. Doesn't show, reaches back out with a very valid reason: I'll book once more.  3. Doesn't show, doesn't reach out: I'll never book again.  Wasting someone's time is worse than $$.
1455194052215836679 2021-11-01 15:24:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks In-depth threads seem to work the best but require the most effort. Outside of that, just sharing what I'm working on and staying on message consistently.
1455193453822980108 2021-11-01 15:22:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mr_M_E Trying.

1455193209072652297 2021-11-01 15:21:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @volodarik Thanks so much, Aleksandr.
1455193153384992783 2021-11-01 15:20:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VissvaAlan Thanks, Vissva. Appreciate it.
1455193066952876034 2021-11-01 15:20:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @connor_skelly_ Appreciate it, Connor!
1455193006894632974 2021-11-01 15:20:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamcesarromero That seems to be the formula.
1455192963739537422 2021-11-01 15:20:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jimmydouglas Pretty pumped myself, Jimmy.
1455180755659853826 2021-11-01 14:31:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypertrophydoc I'm finding that out very quickly.
1455180657395748872 2021-11-01 14:31:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennis_geelen Very much appreciated, Dennis. Thank you.
1455178342072729609 2021-11-01 14:22:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona The guy who influenced the me the most is Daniel Vassallo. I quit my job shortly after he did and stumbled on his content and it resonated.
1455178102997389315 2021-11-01 14:21:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rohangilkes That’s super nice, man. Thank you.   Just trying to catch up to folks like you 🙌🏻
1455176790566227973 2021-11-01 14:15:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Look at you go! Keep it up man.
1455175431250972672 2021-11-01 14:10:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness Ha. Hardly. Just getting my sea legs.
1455174752453242886 2021-11-01 14:07:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 12 days ago, I decided to write daily on Twitter for one year.  2.12M impressions and 5,014 new friends later...   This appears to have been a smart move.  https://t.co/AvgcyBPj02
1455152586034753542 2021-11-01 12:39:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonleowsg Yep - check my pinned tweet, and also on my website:  https://t.co/64c9clqIuz
1455149497407967238 2021-11-01 12:27:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonleowsg It hasn't always been a prerequisite but is certainly becoming more so.
1455142876749443074 2021-11-01 12:01:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonleowsg I have an advising business that takes about 4 hours per week or so.  I have 2 digital products which require no time.  I run a community that requires 7-10 hours per week.  This new idea is a tech-enabled service business that I could likely outsource.  So, not too thin.
1455092616547209220 2021-11-01 08:41:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tdinh_me 👋
1454983406492717060 2021-11-01 01:27:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sachin_ramje Congrats Sachin! Signing up now.
1454980890828972035 2021-11-01 01:17:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePupOfWallSt I don’t. Should I?
1454970756853547008 2021-11-01 00:37:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shresth3Avishek It’s a tech-enabled service so no major buildout required.
1454943068851945476 2021-10-31 22:47:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brian1625 @chrishlad Other people are laughing.   Cue mine.
1454938649326407680 2021-10-31 22:29:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrishlad It’s something that blends into the background but when you isolate it and think about it you’re like…wait, what?
1454937710171459584 2021-10-31 22:25:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrishlad Laugh tracks.
1454928816686698496 2021-10-31 21:50:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yosoyMH Promote it to a small section of my email list or my community and then put it through the process, create process docs, look for problems, get feedback etc
1454892293585047552 2021-10-31 19:25:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alixedi Amazing! So, we're not alone in our inspiration? :)
1454891984624234499 2021-10-31 19:24:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sachin_ramje Boom. can't wait to see it!
1454891313808257027 2021-10-31 19:21:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor @sachin_ramje I'm going to soft launch it inside of A&amp;I for a big discount just to get some feedback on the idea and execution.
1454891064293265409 2021-10-31 19:20:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aflorescpywrtr Fry it up. 🥓
1454890964380704768 2021-10-31 19:20:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @leanderhowardii Same. I go to the gym maybe 2-3x per week, but I love a good walk (plus I've had back surgery twice so walking is best)
1454890868314361858 2021-10-31 19:19:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nevin1901 Yeah, I get that. My brain doesn't work quite that way, but at least you know.
1454890752023142402 2021-10-31 19:19:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @isthisReda It was pretty exciting (and it made the walk much faster)
1454890655340171264 2021-10-31 19:18:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @suryasays Where you living nowadays?
1454890614416412677 2021-10-31 19:18:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sachin_ramje Thanks man! Love your ability to execute on illustrations quickly and easily.
1454880251000016899 2021-10-31 18:37:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypertrophydoc It’s as if i can think 10x more clearly. I love a good long walk with a smart partner.
1454879773881143296 2021-10-31 18:35:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @eraldocavalli Sounds like the good doctor broke it down really well.
1454879455202193415 2021-10-31 18:34:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Yeah. I look forward to getting it done!
1454879361484607489 2021-10-31 18:34:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheAlexBowen I walk every day. It’s the best exercise for thinking imo
1454879271458070528 2021-10-31 18:33:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mahek_MD I love it. Appreciate that insight!
1454878354033762305 2021-10-31 18:30:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @InfinityMastery Thank you! Me too.
1454878310085836807 2021-10-31 18:29:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mahek_MD Same. My wife pulled this one out of me just by asking good questions.  My brain was free from distraction so I could effectively think through it.
1454877455764926465 2021-10-31 18:26:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Brainstormed a new business idea during a 6-mile walk with my wife today.  - Domain purchased - MVP site in progress - Soft launch in a few weeks  Taking walks is a business cheat code.
1454557875486003203 2021-10-30 21:16:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sonnybyrd My take is to overdeliver at a great price (whatever you feel comfortable at) and then to grow your price over time as you build trust.
1454557054413197315 2021-10-30 21:13:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sonnybyrd Mine can run 2 hours, but I've taken amazing courses that are 45 minutes long.   The longer, the less likely people are to finish.   So, when you're starting, just get someone from point A to point B quickly and easily.
1454554192748728331 2021-10-30 21:01:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tanyamoushi I do video courses recorded on Loom and GDrive/Notion. Keep it pretty simple.
1454546747724869638 2021-10-30 20:32:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_DaveyRussell @ishverduzco I'm looking to buy in VT. Would love to learn more though.
1454506225148772356 2021-10-30 17:51:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ishverduzco Buy a BnB.
1454500030585393159 2021-10-30 17:26:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Most people don't want to learn "everything". They want to learn how to get from point A to point B.
1454498700747812870 2021-10-30 17:21:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brie_e_anderson Don't think about it as selling.  Instead, teach people how to do something over the course of time. Share your expertise.  After doing that for some time, package your learnings up and offer it at a good price.
1454498465246023685 2021-10-30 17:20:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sachin_ramje Absolutely, my man.
1454493299415392267 2021-10-30 17:00:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @seempaq Nice. Where can people find it?
1454493229215371270 2021-10-30 16:59:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UnleashTheKnow_ Thank you. Not even a hack really...just a more simple process than people think.
1454489202108903425 2021-10-30 16:43:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Nice. Hypnosis sounds pretty serious.
1454487976973684742 2021-10-30 16:38:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Digital course launch 101:  - Topic you could talk about unprepared - Presell via landing page first - Focused on one outcome - Timebox 14 to 30 days - Keep it short (45 min.) - Beta group + feedback - Ask for testimonials - Upsell coaching  Start one this weekend.
1454484922899517443 2021-10-30 16:26:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Thanks so much for sharing my thread, Aadit. Massive appreciation.
1454207948239015944 2021-10-29 22:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrew_correll_ Nice work! 🔥
1454202259097665537 2021-10-29 21:43:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fortelabs Certainly more attainable than most believe.
1454196848860803072 2021-10-29 21:22:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justinmooretfam It’s both. (See tweet above)
1454196766748856329 2021-10-29 21:21:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justinmooretfam Per year originally. Moved to $99 per quarter to get some optionality.
1454191401349140490 2021-10-29 21:00:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reneefishman At the time (late 2018) I thought of Twitter as a place to get news and I had a few friends writing on LinkedIn.   It just sort of happened without a whole lot of thought behind the choice.   My community has a LI lean but it’s all about the creator.
1454182740316889093 2021-10-29 20:25:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agrisworks Many, many examples. Go follow @Gumroad and pay attention to what creators they shine their light on.  Great way to learn about people creating income from their knowledge.
1454174036506943494 2021-10-29 19:51:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ES738AN @sahilypatel  https://t.co/hHQctr3loY
1454173878843056135 2021-10-29 19:50:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann @amandanat @brandonthezhang @aaditsh I book people's time simply to get an outsider's eyes on my business.  I've found I have tunnel vision, so someone who isn't super close to my business can usually come in and offer a very valuable perspective.
1454173432766210050 2021-10-29 19:48:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EdLatimore The best way to be interesting online is to be interesting offline.
1454172355962548229 2021-10-29 19:44:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @goodideasspread I've always just priced my stuff at the rate that I would feel comfortable paying for, and what I feel comfortable asking for. That's basically my whole strategy.
1454170514579206145 2021-10-29 19:37:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth It becomes empowering when you realize it’s true.
1454169635532820492 2021-10-29 19:33:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @goodideasspread What would you feel comfortable paying for it?
1454169075144433675 2021-10-29 19:31:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kenwtong My wife and I are looking at investment properties. I'd buy that. If I would, so would a thousand other people.
1454164744726798337 2021-10-29 19:14:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tonyplasencia3 @DiffusionMe That's awesome. I love it. Going to check that out.
1454161350733750279 2021-10-29 19:00:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WebWallen Get after it, Daniel. I'm sure there is plenty of good stuff there.
1454160934562324482 2021-10-29 18:59:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaakkojar Semi-guilty.
1454160092539072516 2021-10-29 18:55:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trevorgodfrey_ Yep, or just PDF it and make it $15 just to validate. Toss it on Gumroad. If people buy it, go deeper.
1454158791839264772 2021-10-29 18:50:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Brady_The_Flynn I found an old sales playbook I built. 80 pages. Could likely turn it into a template and sell it for a few hundred bucks and a few hundred times.
1454158259145871364 2021-10-29 18:48:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister Even if something is worth just $10, that's just 100 customers over time.
1454158132448567299 2021-10-29 18:48:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sahilypatel Yeah. I'm 40, so I chose Google Drive. Probably should have said Notion. Haha.
1454157789081767940 2021-10-29 18:46:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SocialQui Things you know and have documented have value to people who don't know them.
1454157676980670473 2021-10-29 18:46:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jsizzle_0 Google Drive, Notion, wherever.
1454157465994543110 2021-10-29 18:45:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone has at least $1,000 of side income just sitting on their Google Drive.
1454151350946877451 2021-10-29 18:21:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith @dvassallo @MeetKevon @AprilynneA @brennandunn Thanks. Checking it out now. Much appreciated.
1454145113341538305 2021-10-29 17:56:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aakashg0 @LinkedIn Check out what @andreasjonssonn is building at @getshieldapp
1453829590770765834 2021-10-28 21:02:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayd3sai Yep! I love both @NotionHQ and @airtable. 2 of the most important tools in my stack.
1453807109716549637 2021-10-28 19:33:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sebastiaanluca @optimized3x Landing page + mailing list/social media following/relevant industry sites
1453794170464780294 2021-10-28 18:41:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @optimized3x Presell before you build anything.
1453791532247654403 2021-10-28 18:31:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @isthisReda There's a lot of harm in not testing.
1453789421459976202 2021-10-28 18:23:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ES738AN It’s better than being addicted to an idea that never takes off, ya know?
1453787900596785163 2021-10-28 18:17:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Running a one-person business means knowing what not to work on.  Idea validation has never been faster &amp; easier.  - Domain (Google): $12/yr - Website (Carrd): $19/yr - Payment/delivery (Gumroad): Free  Always spend $31 before you go deep on something people don't want or need.
1453726457385996302 2021-10-28 14:12:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aakashg0 99% of people fall off over time.   Sometimes that strategy can simply be to outlast everyone.
1453726322803367938 2021-10-28 14:12:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Crypto16Dini Last man standing.
1453725549914849283 2021-10-28 14:09:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone is looking for a shortcut, so the short game is fierce.  Playing the long game is significantly less crowded.
1453707571341168640 2021-10-28 12:57:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Great list, Dickie.  People spend so much time on content without spending nearly as much on the format.  Getting both right means more people reading and ingesting your knowledge.
1453477578656858116 2021-10-27 21:43:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @florinpop1705 This is awesome. Love this idea!
1453467425463226379 2021-10-27 21:03:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichelleCaira I had been actively building my audience for about 1 year. I feel like building out your audience is key to getting everything else right.
1453467178553028614 2021-10-27 21:02:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Oljaandjelkovic My favorite game is How Much Time Can I Spend With My Wife?
1453449272511369217 2021-10-27 19:51:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vijayswamidass I'm not a religious man, but I sure like that.
1453449205436006401 2021-10-27 19:51:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMKhateeb 100%.   I've been trapped in this game before and it all starts with comparison. It's a mindmess.
1453449058614456334 2021-10-27 19:50:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayd3sai @dingraps I think most people are aware but assume the barrier to entry is too high, when it's never been lower.
1453435241843015681 2021-10-27 18:55:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reneefishman No reason other than a few friends had built a following their and I saw an opportunity to use it like social media vs. how everyone else used it (resume, jobs, promotions, etc.)
1453435052424105986 2021-10-27 18:54:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reneefishman I actually wrote an article about loneliness when launching my community:  https://t.co/rVLSozERec
1453433985913298947 2021-10-27 18:50:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dingraps The only way to "have" something else is to create it (or be lucky enough to inherit it, which most of us aren't).  There has never been a better time to start creating your own luck.  If you love the game, then there's no issue to solve.
1453433142841384964 2021-10-27 18:47:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisFranco I like that...
1453431222072451081 2021-10-27 18:39:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reneefishman Of course. If there is anything helpful I can share about how my wife and I work/support each other, feel free to ask.
1453431104761913348 2021-10-27 18:39:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A lot of people I know sacrifice their lives to win an imaginary competition with their peers.  What's the point of winning a game you hate playing?
1453430370821627912 2021-10-27 18:36:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reneefishman 100% she's an enormous part of it.  When I say "one-person business" I meant to refer to the fact that I technically have no employees.  My wife and I support each other's businesses in many, many ways outside of just staying organized.
1453363927388233728 2021-10-27 14:12:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush Thanks, Dickie. What you're doing is certainly an inspiration to me. Appreciate the kind words, and look forward to sharing more.
1453359742785572868 2021-10-27 13:55:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I’d love to figure out how.   Want to see if we can put our heads together and make it happen?
1453358672818675715 2021-10-27 13:51:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Thanks, Nicolas. Appreciate it.   FYI, a lot of my community members are absolutely raving about Ship 30 for 30.   Say it’s the best program they’ve been involved in. Congrats man.
1453325006537216009 2021-10-27 11:37:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Started out with one business and then came across your content.  Diversification then became the goal.  Thanks for shedding a little light on my story with your audience, Daniel. Cheers.
1453143087816056833 2021-10-26 23:34:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marcusgrimm None of those things, specifically.  Just one course that I think tells my students how to get from point A to point B as quickly and easily as possible.  Focusing on anything else is just a waste of time.
1453132772416098309 2021-10-26 22:53:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @suryasays Thanks, my man. 👋  I think about our time at PublicStuff often. I hope you're doing extremely well, Surya.
1453122374673571847 2021-10-26 22:12:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MelaniesLounge Thanks so much for taking some time to read it, Melanie.  Always appreciated.
1453112332167548930 2021-10-26 21:32:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dfgentile No, all Twitter/LinkedIn style short posts.  Once in a while I'll write a blog and then turn it into a thread (like this) and then many micro pieces as well.
1453108831798669317 2021-10-26 21:18:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Scribblerpoet Super kind, man.  Every single day I question whether I know anything.  Hearing nice things like this makes it easier to continue to share. Appreciate it.
1453107552619794440 2021-10-26 21:13:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Scribblerpoet It's not a bad idea.   Candidly, I don't really want to scale. I like small, not big.  Minimum responsibility while maintaining current revenue/income production.
1453107182778687496 2021-10-26 21:12:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @conner_xyz I'm not. Sounds like I should be?
1453103903969628168 2021-10-26 20:59:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Yannick_Veys Thanks, Yannick. Btw, loved using @hypefury to make this thread easy to push out.  Took 5 days to get the copy correct, but just a few minutes to load it up and get it sent out.  Cheers to building great products.
1453102479894319107 2021-10-26 20:53:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @will_mannon Appreciate you reading Will.
1453102427918450688 2021-10-26 20:53:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VeryGoodCopy Hey Eddie - thanks so much, man. I hope you're well.
1453101847829434370 2021-10-26 20:50:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dfgentile Great questions.  I started entirely on LinkedIn and slowly moved people to email. (although not as much as is recommended)  I've learned to write pretty quickly after 3 years of creating content. I write 5-10 pieces each weekend and dedicate 45 minutes per AM to engage.
1453100524908187649 2021-10-26 20:45:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DanielleMorrill Thank you so much, Danielle. Appreciate it.  You're a legend.  So pleased to know you read this.
1453097711713099784 2021-10-26 20:34:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PiotrPiwowar1 Jak zmieniły się czasy.
1453094994349371403 2021-10-26 20:23:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyitsalexsu Thank so much, Alex. Really appreciated!
1453092406686007299 2021-10-26 20:13:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Brennen_Smith_ Thanks, Brennen. Generally, I find that customers are best for adjusting your compass.
1453089939785142273 2021-10-26 20:03:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @roberttpierce That's awesome. I'm so glad you did and appreciate you taking the time to read it.
1453089863260164098 2021-10-26 20:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Sc0ttThegreat Thanks, man.
1453088485833953282 2021-10-26 19:57:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Sc0ttThegreat Thank you. It's a much skinnier pre-pandemic Justin.
1453087990868238340 2021-10-26 19:55:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @B2Bsalesandmkg No need. Plenty of ups and downs. It's just about staying in the game.
1453085498864513033 2021-10-26 19:45:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lesroco That's an awesome compliment. Thanks, Les.   No selling, just sharing here.
1453082526805897223 2021-10-26 19:34:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trinefalbe I jumped into the deep end, but not because I thought I had it all figured out.  I burned out at my executive role and needed a break.  I was sort of forced into figuring it out.
1453082353186844678 2021-10-26 19:33:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GenZGenYmix 1. Almost all free tools.   https://t.co/jp5YZeUqnl  2. I make it a priority by putting it in my calendar and sticking to it.
1453081963603111937 2021-10-26 19:31:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @milmoneycoach30 I believe I was the first, but who knows...I'm sure there was someone before me.  I started using LinkedIn in 2019, the way people use Twitter.  Needless to say, I stuck out like a sore thumb.
1453081773756276744 2021-10-26 19:31:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MemeCodeMoney Haha. I love this :)
1453081707922567168 2021-10-26 19:30:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mriley_builds @dunkhippo33 Appreciate it, Michael.
1453081635558154250 2021-10-26 19:30:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itthinx Thank you very much.
1453077434786586626 2021-10-26 19:13:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcooch Thanks, and thanks for sharing it, Mike. Cheers.
1453076552460218371 2021-10-26 19:10:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jeroen_Lampe Bedankt om dit te delen!
1453075013989511183 2021-10-26 19:04:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @goeringm Thanks for sharing, Megan.  My way is just 1 of a million different paths. I hope people feel encouraged to find theirs.
1453074023320010753 2021-10-26 19:00:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LarsMatthys Much appreciated, Lars!
1453071008068509706 2021-10-26 18:48:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeoffTRoberts @dvassallo Today I have 2 packages:  2x monthly meetings: $4k 4x monthly meetings: $7.2k  I used to scope projects at $1k per hour, now I just advise.  For the majority of the time, I carried 8-10 clients at a time.  Retainers are 90 days long and then month-to-month.
1453070128766144513 2021-10-26 18:44:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danielsalmeronm No, I just haven't spent the time looking into it, to be honest.  I wish I had a better answer other than that.
1453069997618651137 2021-10-26 18:44:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @biz_sunny It's not 880k per year. It's 880k over 27 months.  Not just copywriting, but also a good reputation in the industry, and some connections I've made over time.
1453067631846645762 2021-10-26 18:34:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @guapmof I don’t charge. I put people through an inquiry form and make sure they meet my niche before I’ll schedule something.
1453067003145621518 2021-10-26 18:32:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @guapmof For my consulting business?
1453066519081111559 2021-10-26 18:30:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen @jmcmillen89 Thanks for making it work seamlessly and easily.
1453066144693342209 2021-10-26 18:29:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @biz_sunny Yep. I have very minimal business costs.   I build all my own websites, do all my own copywriting, and have a few subscriptions software products that I use.  I don't travel or do business meetings/dinners.
1453065368398974981 2021-10-26 18:25:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 I embed  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I (thanks, @damengchen) right into the Teachable module and students can record a visual testimonial.  Those videos are added automatically to my website.  Insanely valuable for purchase improvement.  https://t.co/w2QjLAAu6O
1453064259034927110 2021-10-26 18:21:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gozieiheanacho Thank you so much, Iheanacho. I appreciate that.
1453064184565014528 2021-10-26 18:21:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto Thank you.  Congrats to you as well on your launch, Aaron.  ✏️
1453064036917125121 2021-10-26 18:20:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto Very much appreciate you sharing, Aaron. Thank you.
1453063967065182212 2021-10-26 18:20:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson Candidly, not much. I leave it to the affiliates to do their thing.  I'm sure investing time would make it better, but investing my time elsewhere is more valuable at the moment.
1453062919265136646 2021-10-26 18:16:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UnleashTheKnow_ Appreciate it!
1453061850036379649 2021-10-26 18:11:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Super kind of you to share, Jacob.  Many thanks.
1453061795455844360 2021-10-26 18:11:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Too kind. Thank you, my man. Lots of hesitation before sharing. Glad I did.
1453060775841521664 2021-10-26 18:07:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GeorgeNoble07 @YouActualized Thanks, George!
1453059870752706565 2021-10-26 18:04:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JMorch Certainly. This was just my path, but the lessons can likely be applied elsewhere.  Good luck!
1453059698433957890 2021-10-26 18:03:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @quinnjmiller 💪
1453058761724203014 2021-10-26 17:59:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdrienneNakohl Thanks, Adrienne. Much appreciated.
1453057776456978433 2021-10-26 17:55:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heydannypeavey Thanks, Danny! Hope all is well.
1453057697553715211 2021-10-26 17:55:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisRocas @dvassallo I actually moved from consulting to advising. I've stopped doing deliverables or projects completely.  Now, I act a lot like an equity-based advisor, I just take cash.
1453057517580439560 2021-10-26 17:54:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealexbanks Thanks so much, Alex. It's been a fun ride. Thanks for tuning in.
1453050238021816328 2021-10-26 17:25:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor I think service businesses are the best place to uncover product ideas, yes.
1453048281739694086 2021-10-26 17:18:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister Thanks so much for reading this long one!
1453046526620672006 2021-10-26 17:11:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith @dvassallo It happened to be around 20k followers on LinkedIn, but now that LinkedIn is more saturated, that's like 40k-50k followers today.  It's less about followers though, and more about the signals. If people are hitting your DMs regularly asking about the same thing...that's a sign.
1453045494293401606 2021-10-26 17:06:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hustlenconquer Appreciate it!
1453045406573674496 2021-10-26 17:06:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith @dvassallo I won't speak for him, but it certainly was critical for me.   None of what I do would have been as impactful had I not spent time building an audience somewhere.
1453041462166294588 2021-10-26 16:50:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vk_operator @SullyBusiness I'm not well-versed in this, but I believe @BrendanHufford is.
1453039886160863236 2021-10-26 16:44:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vk_operator @SullyBusiness You've already created the content.  Better off sharing it wherever you can, ya know?
1453039690886623234 2021-10-26 16:43:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DwijaBaxi Thanks so much, Dwija.   No unicorns here. Just a decent lifestyle business.
1453034607952244741 2021-10-26 16:23:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OmarMKhateeb You never once interacted with me, but here's my $1,497 masterclass.   I find that approach to be the opposite of what I think will continue to work.
1453032960979087370 2021-10-26 16:17:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandondigital Thanks, Brandon. Same here, man.   I feel like I'm still at the very beginning of this journey.
1453032795383734290 2021-10-26 16:16:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CalebBillesbach Appreciate you as a customer, Caleb 🙌
1453029837413797893 2021-10-26 16:04:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm not sure what's next yet, but I'll be sharing as I figure it out.  If this was helpful, feel free to give me a follow.  If you have any questions, ask away.   Happy to give out as many helpful tips as I can muster today.  Thanks for reading.
1453029834922340356 2021-10-26 16:04:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. I still keep 2-3 consulting clients that I love on retainer.  2. I don't do any paid advertising of any kind.  3. I don't have any employees, but I do have a wife that helps me stay very organized.
1453029830908338185 2021-10-26 16:04:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Finally, here's what my business revenue looks like after 2 years and 3 months:  Consulting: $880k Products:  $341k Community: $81k (collected)  (many thanks to people like @dvassallo for his portfolio of small bets strategy)  A few last notes of potential interest 👇🏻
1453029828102393859 2021-10-26 16:04:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 14/ Created optionality  I'm loving the community but realize, like anything, that love may not last forever.  Yearly subscriptions meant I'm on the hook for 12 months.  To create optionality, I moved to $99/quarters.  Now I'm always 90 days away from stopping.
1453029824830844934 2021-10-26 16:04:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> *Extra snippet:* @GeoffTRoberts  at @outseta wrote a really great article about building the community with automation to $40k+ in just 48 hours here:    https://t.co/EAvITZI64v
1453029822968565772 2021-10-26 16:04:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 13/ Built a community  As sales picked up, my interest in consulting faded.  I was doing $2k per day in info products and wanted to run with that.  I opened a private community for LinkedIn creators and charged $199.   Those who completed my course were prompted to join.
1453029820753973255 2021-10-26 16:04:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 13/ I began creating an army  At the halfway point of my course, people are encouraged to leave a testimonial and sign up for an affiliate program.  I built the same automation at the conclusion of the course.  I have 102 affiliates generating roughly $20 per month, per person.
1453029818774216705 2021-10-26 16:04:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 12/ Marketed aggressively  With 100% of my LinkedIn content focused on audience growth, and a product directly related to that content, sales took off.  My previous course grossed $75k in 15 months.  The second version has grossed $186k in 3 months.  Next up...
1453029816479911940 2021-10-26 16:04:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 11/ Tripled down  After the course was outdated, people started asking for a new version.  I rebuilt the course, but this time charged $150.  The earlier $50 price was my "trust tripwire".  I charged $50, delivered 100x worth the price, and built trust w/ a loyal customer base.
1453029813560696856 2021-10-26 16:04:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ Ran with it  Over the next 15 months, I sold about $75k of the course.  I posted about audience building on LinkedIn and found other ways to continue to land consulting clients. (VCs, news sites, blogs, SaaStr, etc)  Even though it felt confusing, I continued to run with it.
1453029810792509447 2021-10-26 16:04:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/ Made my first product $$  I put the product for sale on Gumroad on April 16th, 2020.   In the first month, I made $10,482.   I was shocked.  I now had my first digital product, but it was in a totally different niche than my service business.  Honestly, this confused me.
1453029809051815943 2021-10-26 16:04:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Tested a hypothesis  I had organically grown to 20k+ followers on LinkedIn &amp; people wanted to know more.  I had a hypothesis that this would be an easy info product I could create &amp; sell.  I put together a short course for $50 (more on price later) &amp; wrote posts about it.
1453029800310939654 2021-10-26 16:04:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Kept my eyes and ears open  Something really interesting happened.  In an attempt to find common problems to productize, I started rereading my LinkedIn DMs.  I had some repetitive questions about SaaS sales, but I also had an inbox jammed with questions about LinkedIn.
1453029797848915976 2021-10-26 16:04:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Reduced my time  With new rates, I could have worked the same and made 2x as much.   Instead, I chose to work 50% of the time and make the same.  I used that extra time to figure out how to scale automated income.  My goal has always been to get my time back.
1453029795428773900 2021-10-26 16:04:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ 2x'ed my rates  With a well-defined niche, some happy customers, and testimonials, I 2x'ed my rates.  I started creating more content that was even more targeted. This led to more conversations with ideal-fit prospects.  I said no to any company outside of my niche.
1453029792769585160 2021-10-26 16:04:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Found my ideal customers  Inside of your customer base is more signals.  What are the commonalities between the customers you love and those who love you?  Mine were early-stage SMB SaaS companies in the healthcare space. A space I was experienced in.  That became my niche.
1453029789430865921 2021-10-26 16:04:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Built a service business  My experience building SaaS sales teams was resonating. So I began creating more and more content about that.  Founders sent me DMs asking questions.   I responded to every single one.  Once I had prospects in my funnel, I started consulting.
1453029787430232066 2021-10-26 16:04:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Honed in on signals  Inside of all of that noise were some signals.  Sometimes I bombed, sometimes I struck a chord.  The more I looked at what resonated, the more I doubled down.   This allowed me to understand what people cared about.
1453029782631895043 2021-10-26 16:04:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Last week my little one-person business crossed $1.3M in revenue.  It took 810 days, I ran zero paid ads and operate at a ~98% margin.  Here are the 14 steps of my strange journey:  Hope it's helpful to someone.  [🧵 thread]
1452960662519492610 2021-10-26 11:29:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness You're no dummy, my man.  People are so busy saying shitty things about it, that they don't realize the potential.  It's massive.
1452659279408865288 2021-10-25 15:32:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JLBellefeuille That's a helluva driving force. I love it.
1452646083281231874 2021-10-25 14:39:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Synnovatia Yep. Feels like profitability could be an outcome of better/faster.
1452627818614038537 2021-10-25 13:27:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CalebBillesbach Thank you, Caleb.
1452627606453489672 2021-10-25 13:26:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every time you have an infuriating customer experience, write it down.  A list of problems = a list of opportunities  Then solve one problem:  - Better - Faster - Cheaper  Ideas are packed inside of frustration.
1452611469074391049 2021-10-25 12:22:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaakkojar Saying 1 thing 1,000 ways &gt; saying 1,000 things 1 way
1452394967134048267 2021-10-24 22:01:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto Your products are super meaningful. My wife is jazzed about the newest one. Looking fwd to it.
1452341433143283713 2021-10-24 18:29:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mar15sa This is an awesome thread. Thank you for sharing!
1452336631940358162 2021-10-24 18:10:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mar15sa Love that idea of "personally optimized". I'm still attempting to move toward that more frequently.
1452333710108418058 2021-10-24 17:58:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DavidVanMtl That's a great share.  Learning, tinkering, building...all things I loved doing at early-stage startups.  The ability to do those things with a bit of flexibility and freedom throw-in has made solopreneurship a lot of fun.
1452333194741698566 2021-10-24 17:56:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor That's what drives me.
1452330811110404118 2021-10-24 17:47:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uluhonolulu I love to work. I feel lost without something to drive towards.   I just want it to be my thing.
1452330434247942151 2021-10-24 17:45:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StackOnTheLow Ha. Same.
1452329061171273728 2021-10-24 17:40:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My goal as an entrepreneur was never to work less.   It’s always been freedom, flexibility, and meaning.  What’s yours?
1452083964244545541 2021-10-24 01:26:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness @JayMaxweII Love it.   Keep it going. An underrated place to grow.
1452082871389368320 2021-10-24 01:21:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness @JayMaxweII Looking fwd to hearing your thoughts 🙌🏻
1452074898755661838 2021-10-24 00:50:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shl I have no doubt.  Will share my thoughts as soon as I’m done.   Appreciate you writing it.
1452030020235448323 2021-10-23 21:51:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> P.S. I've also been a long-time @gumroad user.  I signed up on March 13th, 2020 and because it was so easy, I made my first dollar online that day.  17 months later, I'm over $323k in sales.  Here's hoping this book unlocks a little more.   I'll keep you posted.
1452030019270742016 2021-10-23 21:51:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I bought it because he talks about entrepreneurship in a way that resonates with me  - I don't want to raise $100M - I don't want to build a unicorn  I just want to help people and continue to diversify my portfolio of small, profitable, one-person businesses.
1452030015441412098 2021-10-23 21:51:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Confession: I don't read a lot of books.  Especially books on business &amp; entrepreneurship.  I find most of them to be 200+ pages of recycled blog posts and fluff.  I just received The Minimalist Entrepreneur by @shl   I haven't been this excited for a book in a while.  https://t.co/tnVYnVzlXW
1451651427554762756 2021-10-22 20:47:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hq_storage Appreciate it, Josh. 💪
1451647584938995718 2021-10-22 20:32:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stevenshills20 I get invited to a lot of podcasts I don't want to do or that aren't relevant.  That's my process doc for saying no.
1451630577862561804 2021-10-22 19:24:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IgorRanc Generally no formula. Go in and.m check out interactions.   Everything is templatized though.
1451618502956228617 2021-10-22 18:36:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heydannypeavey Spin up an email. That’s what I did.   Not my email.
1451609084906647565 2021-10-22 17:59:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lori_bolo Yep. Here are some of my process docs:  Mostly customer service issues, but also saying no to things and creating weekly emails to my community.  https://t.co/BoHJruQz2q
1451605928718053380 2021-10-22 17:46:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_talalahmad @AfenoBright I have an advisory business, built 2 digital products, run a paid community, and do 1:1 coaching.
1451580227059163160 2021-10-22 16:04:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel It's so 101, that I kept forgetting to do it.
1451576000383524872 2021-10-22 15:47:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @erikbison @LemonpieFM @HatchEdits @tferriss @Jason @davegerhardt Underrated Tweet already.  Everyone should read this. We all wake up each morning with the ability to create our own luck.   And creating it has never been easier than it is right now.  The upside is infinite while the downside is almost non-existent.
1451570399024668680 2021-10-22 15:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @panphora Hey David - Check out this article on Indie Hackers by @Yannick_Veys    https://t.co/5d9XFXdJfD  Worth a read for your predicament. Hope that helps.
1451546195197845505 2021-10-22 13:49:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaakkojar This looks great. I'm going to check this out on my flight today. Thanks for sharing, Jaakko.
1451542398723571715 2021-10-22 13:34:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zlatanvano @integromat @RowsHQ This is awesome!
1451542358860906510 2021-10-22 13:34:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SullyBusiness @loom It's so helpful. I love it.
1451538377141018627 2021-10-22 13:18:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've saved 15+ hours this month by looking for low-value, repetitive tasks in my business.  My simple solution:  - Identify the task - Record a Loom video - Store in Notion w/ instructions - Teach someone on Fiverr to help - Reroute all of my customer service emails  Freedom.
1451365028830105601 2021-10-22 01:49:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @awilkinson This is one of the best threads I’ve read in awhile. Kudos to you.
1451345326430883845 2021-10-22 00:31:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 I realize after traveling for the last 2 weeks I may be making very little sense. If that’s the case, disregard 😂
1451344600422129667 2021-10-22 00:28:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Bad bosses demand performance because they get off on power. It shows.   Great bosses demand performance because they understand it’s their responsibility to drive. It shows.   The power comes from the hierarchy.   How you behave with that power defines you as a boss.
1451343023955193865 2021-10-22 00:21:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Just as many bosses loathe power but demand performance.   Who hates the boss then?   Under-performers.   Pay attention to who loves and hates the boss. That’s where you learn more about who they are.
1451324940695838720 2021-10-21 23:10:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SocialQui I’m not advocating you learn everything from books.   Go learn by doing.
1451323657272311810 2021-10-21 23:04:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sonnybyrd Mine is Google and Twitter and trying.
1451321383275933706 2021-10-21 22:55:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blcooley And if you do, you’re doing yourself a massive disservice.   Learn to problem solve. Get far. Then ask.
1451321162219278338 2021-10-21 22:55:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @blcooley Everyone is a mentor. They are helpful but only to the extent the mentee is willing to try first.   When the mentee gets stuck the mentor helps.   But don’t ask for help if you haven’t even tried.
1451320208132608003 2021-10-21 22:51:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pheadrick If you can’t teach yourself, you’ll always be a liability to someone.
1451319449676652549 2021-10-21 22:48:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The most important skill to learn is how to learn on your own.  Mentors are great, but overrated.  Mentors work well when you've reached a ceiling of teaching yourself everything you could possibly know about a subject.  Learn to learn and you've built a life-changing muscle.
1451318556776353797 2021-10-21 22:44:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays You were a star. The feedback has been phenomenal. I learned so much myself, Sean.   Your valuable time is much appreciated.
1451313706252574724 2021-10-21 22:25:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush The most compelling one-man marketing show I’ve seen is @CJ_Johnson17th
1451291190972850176 2021-10-21 20:55:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MemeCodeMoney Haha. Love it :)
1451290586967838721 2021-10-21 20:53:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MemeCodeMoney I love John Welsh.
1451289526698131460 2021-10-21 20:49:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MemeCodeMoney Meme your way to fame.
1451288985871978508 2021-10-21 20:47:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AfenoBright - eBook - 1:1 coaching - Digital course - Freelance writing - Doing logo design - Writing a paid newsletter - Rebuilding landing pages - Building no-code software - Running a paid community - Sponsorships on your podcast - Cohort-based coaching program
1451288629154811904 2021-10-21 20:45:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you can influence people online, you have a head start on entrepreneurship.
1451212928724647941 2021-10-21 15:44:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harleyf Agreed. You can build a 6 or 7-figure business (or a diversified portfolio of businesses) in your sweats. Wild.
1450998481011752964 2021-10-21 01:32:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst Dear Zachary.   It's the best movie you'll never want to watch a second time.  It tests your soul. Deeply.
1450975103299342337 2021-10-20 23:59:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CryptoCobain This is the greatest 2-act play ever written.
1450968976943689731 2021-10-20 23:35:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mike_Klemmer It really is. Fail fast and course correct. All the same things people do as operators.
1450967213331128327 2021-10-20 23:28:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Limited downside and enormous upside.
1450965829433143302 2021-10-20 23:23:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justincardillo Amazing, congrats! Keep me posted on wins and struggles. Always happy to share what I’ve learned.
1450962980561113089 2021-10-20 23:11:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you’re a successful operator you likely have the skills to be an entrepreneur.   So much of building on your own is listening, testing, fixing, and testing again.   Stuff you already do.   Has there ever been a better time to try?
1450856894399188999 2021-10-20 16:10:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisRocas Awesome. I've read Deep Work. Will check out Lean Analytics. Appreciate it!
1450855957525929986 2021-10-20 16:06:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisRocas Very cool. Any particular favorite reads?
1450850529697992713 2021-10-20 15:44:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amandaemmanuel More fun and more profitable. 🤷‍♂️
1450849787197145094 2021-10-20 15:41:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Entrepreneurship is a compounding skill.  - The more problems you solve, the more you see.  - The more problems you see, the more solutions you create.  - The more solutions you create, the better they get.  Remember that it's a lot of fun to play the long game
1450839637027606531 2021-10-20 15:01:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 @darentsmith @dvassallo That's what I do. Most of my revenue comes via LinkedIn.
1450618097459769348 2021-10-20 00:21:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sonnybyrd 😂
1450617202718257152 2021-10-20 00:17:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sonnybyrd I’m potentially a major letdown.
1450526376910639104 2021-10-19 18:16:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kim_Currier_ My fave! Coming back in 6 weeks and it’s the first place I grabbed a res at.
1450518595675508743 2021-10-19 17:45:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith @dvassallo In my experience this was true. Build one to stabilize and then expand. I’m sure there are others who did it differently, but that was ky path.
1450513608891420673 2021-10-19 17:26:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor Definitely. That’s what I’m suggesting.
1450513280036921345 2021-10-19 17:24:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @darentsmith Looking fwd to it.
1450513163569582083 2021-10-19 17:24:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kharp04 Agree. People ask me and I don’t really know what to say.
1450513092023042056 2021-10-19 17:24:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor Sure. Instead of building one large business that increases risk (i.e. consultant) build several streams.   - Consultant - Advisor - Coaching - Info product  - Community - SaaS product  Etc.   Lower income per but less risk.
1450512566967574535 2021-10-19 17:21:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith @dvassallo He’s the person who turned me onto thinking this way.   I was going deep into one business and then expanded to 5. Built each of those to nice revenue milestones and just keep adding.   Joined his upcoming cohort based coaching program to learn more.
1450476894693085199 2021-10-19 15:00:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliQOfficial @morganhousel The last part is often the hardest. I get pretty wrapped up in “keeping up with the Joneses” and need to remind myself how important it is to do things I love. Not what other people love.
1450473174404116494 2021-10-19 14:45:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your self-employed income goals are more likely to be achieved with a portfolio strategy.  Think 4-5 smaller income streams.  Provides much greater flexibility and reduced risk when compared to one big bet.
1450449700805652484 2021-10-19 13:12:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LindsayTrombley Of course, that's fine.   As long as nobody else is telling them they weren't cut out to be entrepreneurs.
1450293571379240960 2021-10-19 02:51:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SalesRebellion Much appreciated homie. Hope your travels are going extremely well 💪🏻💪🏻
1450166844325826568 2021-10-18 18:28:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nft_token Awesome. Thank you 🤘🏼
1450166777284075522 2021-10-18 18:27:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timbarnes10 Saw it online and submitted an inquiry. Might just swing by. Thanks man.
1450161575608868865 2021-10-18 18:07:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickB2005 Love Zero Gravity. Jennifer and I have sweatshirts from there that we love.
1450160360691011586 2021-10-18 18:02:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DavidVanMtl Think I'm gonna head over to Penny Cluse now for a late lunch. Thanks!
1450157812428988418 2021-10-18 17:52:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @connorcirillo Heck yeah. Awesome. Thanks, Connor. 👍🏻
1450156868786167811 2021-10-18 17:48:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I just got to Burlington, VT and this is a slice of heaven.  Plan is to drink good beer and do some writing.   If anyone has been here and has recs (or you're here) LMK.  🍺
1450119263994384385 2021-10-18 15:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @businessbarista Cohort.
1450112160600838146 2021-10-18 14:50:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kharp04 Good on ya for doing it. Ignore the doubters and just flourish instead.
1450096946299949062 2021-10-18 13:50:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theyouthfulguy Yeah I feel like it comes off as a weird self-serving statement.   Almost reminding the person saying it that they are special.
1450095444076466189 2021-10-18 13:44:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GradyTeske Ha. Feel you here. I can't stop. Just layering on more and more.
1450095090366652418 2021-10-18 13:43:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GradyTeske Agreed.
1450095054010437634 2021-10-18 13:42:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GradyTeske Yeah definitely. Both very hard.  But this idea that "not everyone is meant for it" has always struck me as strange.  What people are really saying is "I don't think most people have it".
1450094514165665793 2021-10-18 13:40:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GradyTeske Entrepreneurship is not "leaping".  You can easily be an entrepreneur without doing so.   Go build a $500/month side hustle. You're an entrepreneur. No leap required.
1450093954293190657 2021-10-18 13:38:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Alec_Coughlin Or just starting anything.   We've pigeon-holed the term entrepreneur, but I think so many people would benefit from just starting something they own. Anything.
1450093201411411972 2021-10-18 13:35:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> "Entrepreneurship isn't for everyone".  Are we sure?  Maybe starting a venture-backed SaaS company isn't for everyone, but entrepreneurship?   Seems like something everyone should participate in.
1449839679994531840 2021-10-17 20:48:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adammarx13 Yep. Everything easy to you is difficult to someone.  It's all about finding out who those "someone" are.
1449829306662805511 2021-10-17 20:06:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Remember that everything you think is obvious is worth money to someone else.  Have a great Sunday.
1449473357364318212 2021-10-16 20:32:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmckinven Same. Went for a 2-hour walk. Came back to $750 in product sales.  My mind is blown every single day.
1449471349987155971 2021-10-16 20:24:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AltumCode Yep. I'm at almost 2.5 years. It's been an incredible experience.   Can be wildly unpredictable but that forces me to be adaptable as hell. I love that.
1449467958166708224 2021-10-16 20:11:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dagorenouf @Imene_Maharzi I hear that guy is full of shit.   Could be a rumor though.
1449467620357459969 2021-10-16 20:09:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EricJorgenson This resonates for sure.   I think the main difference is that being employed hardly ever deviates. It's likely 40+ hours forever.   I've been able to gradually decrease my hours each quarter working for myself.   Hope the trend continues.
1449463551748415490 2021-10-16 19:53:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister That's awesome. Bonding over business. Love it.
1449463395959382016 2021-10-16 19:52:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pheadrick Just enjoying the ride as long as I can stay on it! Thank you my man.
1449460229012434944 2021-10-16 19:40:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's a wild feeling every time someone buys something you created online.  Spend a little of this Saturday building towards that.  You'll never regret it.
1449140833018654729 2021-10-15 22:31:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scott_bair @gettimewell @captioncub This is dope. Love it.
1449135687211655173 2021-10-15 22:10:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonleowsg @felix12777 @dagorenouf @empirepowder @d__raptis @vensykrishna I'm a former executive sales leader who left SaaS and built out 4 different businesses. None of them are technical:  1. Info product 2. Private community 3. Advising 4. Coaching  So, yep! What about you?
1449135224999366656 2021-10-15 22:08:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen @theKevinShen @AprilynneA @janet_yen1 @MeetKevon @jmckinven Excellent, thanks, Damon. Giving all of these great folks a follow. 🙌
1449081096403132426 2021-10-15 18:33:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_shanicesj Appreciate it!
1449028742630756359 2021-10-15 15:05:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LiamKircher @SullyBusiness @SqueegeeGod @johnny3terson @StrongpointRich On it! Appreciate it.
1449014500330557443 2021-10-15 14:09:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_its_greg @SalesRebellion It's a deep rabbit hole on YouTube.
1449011256183173126 2021-10-15 13:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SalesRebellion My take is that most people are really bad interviewers.   We need a Nardwuar of sales interviewers.   Look him up if that doesn't make sense.
1449007067658862596 2021-10-15 13:39:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mike_Klemmer Definitely. I'm looking specifically to follow folks who share good info on Twitter and come from a non-technical background. Love learning about no-code and low-code builders.
1449005704543670279 2021-10-15 13:34:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Lamacorn20 @AngeZanetti @felix12777 @nicode_it @dagorenouf I've built 4 (1 product, 1 community, advising, coaching) businesses and I don't know how to write a single line of code.
1449004258716749835 2021-10-15 13:28:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Lamacorn20 @AngeZanetti @felix12777 @nicode_it @dagorenouf These are great, thanks. I follow some of these folks already!
1449003120529391641 2021-10-15 13:23:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsjustamar That earned ya a follow for sure. Thanks.

1448999415851663368 2021-10-15 13:09:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andymewborn Gimme someone to follow my man :) Help a guy out.
1448998444681543781 2021-10-15 13:05:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @dinofavara @stephegger @stevenshills20 @rjmsalespro @optimized3x @NoDegreeDotCom @JWellsCFO @MiaKiraki Love it, thanks, Jason. I'll give these folks a follow.
1448996797179912197 2021-10-15 12:58:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm extremely inspired by non-technical entrepreneurs building their own small businesses.  I'd like to start seeing more of them in my feed.  Who should I be following on Twitter?
1448749927996268549 2021-10-14 20:37:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tyleramarcus @schlaf Very much so. 🍺🍺
1448709124900986883 2021-10-14 17:55:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf ☀️Winter: Los Angeles 🛕Spring: New York 🌲Summer: Portland 🍺Fall: Burlington
1448685602900226052 2021-10-14 16:22:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @weirdlyy_funnyy 2 hours in the zone makes for great production.
1448685519882399746 2021-10-14 16:21:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Steve_P_Brady Whatcha pondering?
1448685460918882304 2021-10-14 16:21:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliMirza2k It's the fastest way to learn. All of the things you're wondering about become much clearer.
1448685313321316355 2021-10-14 16:21:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister Simple procrastination.  Feeling like I was moving the ball just by thinking about it.
1448683013202591749 2021-10-14 16:12:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> After tinkering with an idea for months, I finally just took some action today.  Accomplished more in 2 focused hours than in 60 days of wondering.   Reminder to self: Just start.
1448643487914672133 2021-10-14 13:34:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarketingMax Shopify store incoming.
1448642176565514243 2021-10-14 13:29:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarketingMax The entire world is one big marketing funnel.
1448608342612525057 2021-10-14 11:15:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theyouthfulguy That's what I believe. Also, sometimes growth isn't necessary to achieve your ultimate objective.
1448435747401388033 2021-10-13 23:49:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sunglassesface Here's an example of a post where I tell people about my product and encourage them to buy:   https://t.co/fOPwY2nSLq
1448434508953440261 2021-10-13 23:44:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sunglassesface No ad. Just a simple social media post encouraging people to buy.   I've never run an ad before.
1448430222454530049 2021-10-13 23:27:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen Apple, here I come.
1448429741351051264 2021-10-13 23:25:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliQOfficial Definitely. No magic hacks here.  But, even if you're new, you're likely to see much bigger revenue when you ask and provide a compelling reason.
1448426007669714952 2021-10-13 23:10:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann Pinot or an IPA. 🍺
1448424053476315136 2021-10-13 23:02:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann Come on now. Dive in! 😉
1448423630032019459 2021-10-13 23:01:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann I produce about 21 pieces of unique content each month and generally ask about 3-4x per month. So, yes. Sounds about right.
1448422844153704451 2021-10-13 22:58:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen My pleasure.
1448422749135855618 2021-10-13 22:57:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann Just a social media post asking people to buy (obviously outlining their challenges and how my products solve them). That's about it.
1448422422496088064 2021-10-13 22:56:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heydannypeavey A post that asks people to buy basically. I don't do any advertising at all.
1448421804918333440 2021-10-13 22:54:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @diegoquendoo Absolutely. "If you build it, they will come" is not a good product marketing mantra.
1448421304663781383 2021-10-13 22:52:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen First of all, I love this.  Anyone who doesn't understand the value of time and the challenge of context switching is likely not that busy.  Second, I'm absolutely loving  https://t.co/DvQZfAOj2I  My wall is huge and it's such wonderful social proof. Thanks for building it.
1448419275375403011 2021-10-13 22:44:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In the last 30 days, I've promoted my digital products only 2x.  Results:  - Avg. daily sales w/o promotion: $697 - Avg. daily sales w/ promotion: $4,860  7x difference per day.  Revenue doesn't just happen.  To build anything, you'd better get comfortable with promotion.  https://t.co/2ShrCr7Lsk
1448411535236374531 2021-10-13 22:13:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonmpearl Rock on, man. Keep doing you. 💪
1448381482100301825 2021-10-13 20:13:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jayd3sai That’s a great point man. I guess I am!
1448371615235035148 2021-10-13 19:34:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @aaditsh @florinpop1705 Looking forward to it 🔥
1448365145856565256 2021-10-13 19:08:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dunlapandco Ain’t nothing wrong with that.
1448365053456027649 2021-10-13 19:08:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamdavidlevai Awesome. I’ll have to dig back in. Thx!
1448360333878468615 2021-10-13 18:49:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamdavidlevai I own it and have skimmed it a bit, but never sat down and gone cover to cover. Recommend?
1448354882315034629 2021-10-13 18:28:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrosephPoole I’m a solopreneur so I choose between income and time for the most part.
1448345032369528835 2021-10-13 17:48:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn I just want my revenue to stay stagnant while decreasing overall effort.
1448344811640139783 2021-10-13 17:48:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Deciding not to scale doesn't make you any less of an entrepreneur.
1448076550583291906 2021-10-13 00:02:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattboneal The more resourceful, the better. It's a great look at how you handle difficult situations.
1448056495552311296 2021-10-12 22:42:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram @TomBilyeu @LazyLionsNFT @SpaceBoysNFTs @DonteCrypto @metaguardians We should connect more on this.  I'm about to go down a rabbit hole, but I feel like I just showed up to class halfway through the semester...and I'm an exchange student...who doesn't speak the language...
1448054725346217986 2021-10-12 22:35:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram What Discords are you hanging in?
1448054539807072258 2021-10-12 22:34:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @emotf I find that learning is often procrastination when depending on others to teach.  Those who are proactive in teaching themselves are generally biased toward action.  So, execution comes around.
1448053129736491012 2021-10-12 22:29:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The smartest entrepreneurs I know aren't always "smart".  But they are always autonomous.  Learning how to teach yourself is underrated, underappreciated, and often overlooked.
1447906982120337409 2021-10-12 12:48:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sweatystartup @mattragland This you? Or someone you know?
1447554303275806724 2021-10-11 13:26:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jkhasson An internet connection and a willingness to put yourself out there...that's it.
1447547636907708417 2021-10-11 13:00:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith To me, it's amazing how little friction there is to taking part in some of the best conversations in the world.  Wild.
1447543628474298371 2021-10-11 12:44:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SaasDemosKing Hell yeah.
1447538286977851393 2021-10-11 12:23:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregsroche Creating luck requires a simple internet connection. That's just wild.
1447536219446026248 2021-10-11 12:15:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Each morning, I wake up with this realization:  Creating your own luck has never been easier than it is right now.  The upside is infinite while the downside is almost non-existent.  It feels foolish not to embrace this opportunity.
1447201397410250752 2021-10-10 14:04:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn Much appreciated, Natalie. Right back at you re: Twitter. I plan on being a bit more active on here, so it's nice to find folks enjoying my stuff elsewhere. 🙌
1446894905012457482 2021-10-09 17:46:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @SACHIN_RAMJE @Nicolascole77 @dickiebush Thanks, fellas. Really nice to be mentioned with these extremely talented guys.
1446556790750068736 2021-10-08 19:23:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ned_Arick Basically, I help founders avoid expensive mistakes.  Provide an external set of eyes on their GTM, process, systems, etc.  It's not too dissimilar from a board of advisors, except I take cash, not equity.
1441175751764496391 2021-09-23 23:00:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarketingMax @awilkinson I was at ZocDoc for 5 years in various leadership roles and then built PatientPop from $0 to $50M in 4 years. Team about 140.   Not looking but happy to help out here.
1440655323853832195 2021-09-22 12:32:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency Thank you, my man. Appreciate the kind shout out, and been really exciting to watch you grow. Keep it going. Cheers!
1438641993001938947 2021-09-16 23:12:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram Don't sleep on LI 2021 - 2022.
1438638531593834496 2021-09-16 22:58:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @leone_baron @sahilypatel That's a fantastic question, and the answer is "Exile" from The Long Pond Studio sessions...
1438585934765772801 2021-09-16 19:29:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sahilypatel While everyone on Twitter is dumping on LinkedIn, I'm currently at $3.54 per profile visit.  🤷‍♂️  https://t.co/qfSbL8FrXY
1437462984046034944 2021-09-13 17:07:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AwesomeInfoProd Appreciate this!
1437418634515820548 2021-09-13 14:11:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JuiceboxCA You know you’ve made it when someone refers to you in a negative way as a “guru” (quotes and all) for simply sharing your past learnings.
1437070925468364803 2021-09-12 15:09:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CooperKraussKC Congrats, my man. The first of many. Now it’s about feedback and iteration. Get after it.
1436756627642716163 2021-09-11 18:20:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarrisonGarrio @BrianFeroldi @BusMadeSimple Appreciate that, Garrio! Cheers.
1434500315190022145 2021-09-05 12:55:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SACHIN_RAMJE @dickiebush @Nicolascole77 @arvidkahl @aaditsh Thank you, my man. 💪
1433181031767609349 2021-09-01 21:32:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dzeyeneric Teachable will send them out!
1433154867430834189 2021-09-01 19:48:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @made_in_cosmos I feel like burnout is less ab “working hard” and more about lack of control.    Tech companies are chaotic, immature, and often have a poor foundation.   This means continual problems, and an incredible amount of pressure.   People I know in tech fear for their jobs routinely.
1432358912720769025 2021-08-30 15:05:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @gumroad @jmikolay Thank you!
1432351656843358211 2021-08-30 14:37:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gumroad @jmikolay Just paid upfront for the year. Any action needed on my end?
1431631374562299904 2021-08-28 14:54:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @delivreal @kimmiko_james @neilpatel @MeetKevon Thanks so much for the nice feature, man. Newsletter is looking excellent.
1431274557038542853 2021-08-27 15:17:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JuiceboxCA @mkobach Best thing I’ve read today.   Maybe, for me, it was just the timing, but this really hit.   Nice work.
1430914580981633027 2021-08-26 15:26:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki @microacquire @pipe God bless this is good.  The news? Yes.   His performance? Even more so.   Congrats Andrew and @harryhurst
1430649357972525070 2021-08-25 21:52:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @MikeyMHook Bucks are super young. Should be a good game. I think it will actually be close!
1430231037683150853 2021-08-24 18:10:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Great share, Matt.   Solopreneurship sure is a rollercoaster. There are days when being employed feels a lot easier, but then I remember how much time I get to spend with my wife.  Keep at it. 💪
1430190508446523400 2021-08-24 15:29:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @contentigniters Appreciate it, Mike!
1430154046669733896 2021-08-24 13:04:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays Glad you enjoyed it, man. LinkedIn is a goldmine.
1429777631768154116 2021-08-23 12:08:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn @mattaltobell Thanks, everyone. LMK how it goes 🙌
1428436979008606215 2021-08-19 19:21:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmikolay Love this Justin. Congratulations! 🙌
1426229201678569476 2021-08-13 17:08:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattlady @web Keep your head up, Matt. I feel ya.
1425963774360621060 2021-08-12 23:33:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @damengchen Digging your product. About to upgrade.   Keep bringing it.
1425957994743975943 2021-08-12 23:10:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman Aww shit. Thanks, man. I appreciate you.
1425938545412354058 2021-08-12 21:53:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Love using @outseta to set up my private community.   Read about how I built automations using this powerful tool.
1424824159968927757 2021-08-09 20:05:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy customers &gt; customers &gt; comments &gt; engagements &gt; views  Dollars over dopamine.
1424068840984567809 2021-08-07 18:04:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Yeah, that's a great point.   I just keep running into people who are literally charging their previous full-time OTE divided by 2080.  That's guaranteeing 40 hour work weeks to make the same money. 2x that and give yourself half the week back.
1424062402417541123 2021-08-07 17:38:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 It feels like most freelancers I talk to underprice themselves.  With a better understanding of how their business maps to a niche and a better sales pitch, they could turn that 100k into 200k without additional clients.  More money + more time to focus on scalable products.
1423666829646512134 2021-08-06 15:26:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @tibo_maker @irachdaoui I think you can be polarizing without offending anyone or pissing off your workplace.  It's just challenging, that's all.
1423664559081103366 2021-08-06 15:17:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CSMikeCardona @tibo_maker @irachdaoui I like ruffling feathers. We all have strong opinions. I just share mine openly.   I stopped caring about what people thought about me when I realized they weren’t.
1423662015994908672 2021-08-06 15:07:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tibo_maker @CSMikeCardona @irachdaoui I’m glad less people use it 😂
1423661038449332226 2021-08-06 15:03:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tibo_maker @CSMikeCardona @irachdaoui If you're in b2b or b2c and you're not on it, you're missing out.  An observation about Twitter is people spend an exorbitant amount of time criticizing LinkedIn (much of it warranted) when they could spend their time leveraging its reach.  I treat LinkedIn like Twitter &amp; win.

1419659418854174727 2021-07-26 14:02:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandondigital I use a simple template email and just ask.   There's a stat that says something like 80% of customers are willing to give a testimonial but only 30% do.
1419356856586280971 2021-07-25 18:00:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo Ice cubes AND celery, Trish?   Lord.

1418904580507701266 2021-07-24 12:03:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SACHIN_RAMJE @aaditsh This is amazing, Sachin. 🔥🔥  Thank you so much. Loving your illustrations.   Keep it up man.
1418683216773492742 2021-07-23 21:23:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays Appreciate you man. Likewise re: email marketing and products.
1418671243067281414 2021-07-23 20:35:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays For example, I just finished a paid call with Sean 👆🏻even though we have a cordial social media relationship.  I would never think of asking for his expertise in email marketing for free. It's how he makes his living and his advice is worth the payment.  Keep doing you. 🍻
1418670851893907461 2021-07-23 20:34:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort But, one-sided requests:  "Hi - we've never met, but I'm trying to accomplish this specific thing that you usually charge clients for. Can I have 30 minutes for a totally one-sided conversation? Thanks in advance!"  This is what I was driving at.   LMK if that makes more sense.
1418670384849825793 2021-07-23 20:32:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort I probably should have added some more context here, which is my fault. Here's what I mean:  If there is a mutually beneficial conversation to be had, reach out and suggest it. I certainly take free calls all of the time.  I believe our relationship started this way  1/2
1418591263104831488 2021-07-23 15:18:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @levani_tev @daedalium I'm not suggesting introductions. (at least not my intention - perhaps I could have been more clear)  I'm saying when people whom I've never interacted with before reach out and want 15 minutes of non-mutually beneficial time.  How do you think about that?
1418578466828587008 2021-07-23 14:27:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonmpearl Same. I just grabbed a beer with a guy a few weeks ago and formed an acquaintanceship. A few days ago I needed his help so I just paid him. Everyone’s busy.
1418576662321635331 2021-07-23 14:20:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianSexton13 If I accept free calls with every stranger who asks instead of spending time with my wife, then I’ve got my priorities backward as a family man.
1418575863147384839 2021-07-23 14:16:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @levani_tev How so?
1418563357989294080 2021-07-23 13:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis That's probably the right answer.
1418563307036975107 2021-07-23 13:27:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana I've reached out to 2 people I don't know this week with asks.   I've offered to pay both and gladly did.
1418561506564878341 2021-07-23 13:19:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Whenever you ask a stranger for their time, you should proactively offer to pay them for it.  Let it be their decision to give it to you for free.  Why doesn't everyone understand this?
1418376120928460806 2021-07-23 01:03:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yongfook I feel like from a word:value perspective, this is the most valuable tweet I’ve ever read.
1418240163780743169 2021-07-22 16:02:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you want to start putting a unique spin on your content, check out @aaraalto   He’s great at distilling ideas into sketches. Fast.   You’ll love his stuff.
1418233319054090242 2021-07-22 15:35:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto Amazing. Thank you! @Its_Jenn_Here
1418224452051996676 2021-07-22 15:00:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto Showing people how simple investing can be.
1417952411533127681 2021-07-21 20:59:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlfieIsaMarsh @digitalpratik @AliAbdaal @petermckinnon Ahh..appreciate you, Alfie!
1417857707818815493 2021-07-21 14:43:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @healthonpeak The easiest way to do something well is to start by doing it poorly.
1417857035304067075 2021-07-21 14:40:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The more you try, the more you fail.  The more you fail, the more you learn.  The more you learn, the better you get.   As usual, it all starts with trying.
1417634863499423749 2021-07-20 23:57:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StephEgger A lot. It's definitely dependent on building a large following.  But that's why I advocate people invest in doing so.
1417618449279369224 2021-07-20 22:52:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ybhrdwj I almost never add anyone. I have 110k followers but only about 15k connections, 75% of which have come from them connecting to me.
1417618058798145538 2021-07-20 22:50:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ybhrdwj I've been growing it over time for about 31 months now.
1417544818599804928 2021-07-20 17:59:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simoncasciaro @Cokedupoptions @agazdecki @microacquire Found it in the appendix.
1417543434101985291 2021-07-20 17:54:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Cokedupoptions @agazdecki @microacquire Fixed.  https://t.co/umk3pAYCUb
1417537629822795776 2021-07-20 17:31:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CRigoudis August 4th! Might get it done early.
1417522020493955080 2021-07-20 16:29:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Very proud to be a part of this raise.  @agazdecki is doing big things.
1417501091244216326 2021-07-20 15:06:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @col_fink Haha, no worries man.   I did build a $50M sales org so I DO know how to find corporate clients (but don't focus much on it anymore);
1417496293128167426 2021-07-20 14:47:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister @trykarat Yeah the card is just a wedge like the Square dongle.
1417495524278685697 2021-07-20 14:44:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trykarat @StevenTrister Was great to have a chat. Thanks!  Cheers.
1417494811347669001 2021-07-20 14:41:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister @trykarat Oh yeah! It looks absolutely great.   https://t.co/o4pmESCU0q
1417494003952635916 2021-07-20 14:38:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @thealibilawal @trykarat It is weighty as hell.
1417493858993201159 2021-07-20 14:37:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StevenTrister @trykarat Just got it about 10 minutes ago so haven't used it yet.  Onboarding was seamless. Rewards seem killer.
1417493181306970126 2021-07-20 14:34:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal @trykarat Card is REAL nice...Hefty.
1417492233016778758 2021-07-20 14:30:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Arrived today looking fresh.  Thanks, @trykarat  https://t.co/ITLHsHXe9c
1417492225798418442 2021-07-20 14:30:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Saw that @trykarat raised $26M from Union Square Ventures.  Connected w/ their CEO over Zoom, and just scored their new credit card for creators.  https://t.co/sJczobdxAj
1417484273066684424 2021-07-20 13:59:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @col_fink Sure but I know people making 6-figures selling courses on how to make balloon animals.   Also, Twitter is jammed full of people selling “How to Twitter”  The platforms aren’t too dissimilar in that regard.
1417475540085321729 2021-07-20 13:24:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hnabimedia Appreciate it!
1417475428437086213 2021-07-20 13:24:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano True :)
1417475083770109954 2021-07-20 13:22:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In case you're wondering...  Of the $60k in sales:  - $45k came from LinkedIn - $14k came from my email list - $1k came from random other places  It's a powerful platform if you use it right.  If you wanna use it how I use it. 👇🏻  https://t.co/53lVT9nCxa
1417475082025246723 2021-07-20 13:22:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> LinkedIn is underrated.  Here's what I've done so far in July:  - Built a course page - Wrote 1 post on LinkedIn - Wrote 1 email to my email list - Drove 2.8k+ to the landing page - Converted ~19.5% into customers - Sold $60,322 worth of the new course  Creators are missing out.  https://t.co/5dNXzmLxU8
1417289102060408832 2021-07-20 01:03:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @randfish This is an incredibly interesting perspective.
1417284763870707713 2021-07-20 00:46:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mistamor If that’s true, why do you think everyone parrots “Be authentic!” ?
1417282264128446466 2021-07-20 00:36:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector I like that.   (Warning: I’m wrong a lot)  😂
1417281606465773576 2021-07-20 00:34:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector I agree. I’ve been using “income” a lot.
1417281447946227715 2021-07-20 00:33:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @9Flare Right. That would be fine.   But the bigger point here is that most marketing is inauthentic.   Sexy people on the beach don’t drink Coke.  Runners don’t drink Michelob ultra.  Most dinners at Olive Garden aren’t 10 multi-cultural people.
1417280902632296449 2021-07-20 00:31:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector I only mention it because I struggle with the exact same two words.
1417280361629982720 2021-07-20 00:29:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector I like it but don’t love the slash between audience and business.   Comes across as non-committal. One word is probably better than the other.
1417276762258612228 2021-07-20 00:14:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays My gameplan is just die last.
1417276039089250304 2021-07-20 00:11:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano Depends on what you mean by underrated but I’ve always felt NYC &gt; SF
1417275216221323273 2021-07-20 00:08:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @9Flare “2020 was a tough year for all of us…so here at Dyson Vacuums, we’re ready to start 2021 clean…with a sale!”
1417274122879520776 2021-07-20 00:04:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MoniqueVilla “How do we manufacture authenticity??”   - Every CMO
1417273455578341376 2021-07-20 00:01:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Exactly.   Coca-cola isn’t the drink of choice for gorgeous people on a beach, but you wouldn’t know that from their marketing.   Buzzwords are getting to be too much for me.
1417272675035189249 2021-07-19 23:58:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If "be authentic" is such good marketing advice, then why is every commercial completely inauthentic?
1417155076490137607 2021-07-19 16:11:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OneJKMolina I vacillate between thinking I’m the greatest and thinking I’m terrible every single day.   Seems normal.
1417144318947700743 2021-07-19 15:28:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Bluegirlpdx @corprteUnicorn They don’t. They usually disagree.   But when they do, then we work together.
1417138485203554304 2021-07-19 15:05:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @corprteUnicorn This is why I require payment upfront.
1417120043830321156 2021-07-19 13:52:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort At my favorite bar in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, the bartender gave me a free beer each time I came in.  I moved to LA and didn't get a free beer for 4.5 years.
1417108040810123272 2021-07-19 13:04:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SandeshChahar4 Yep. Good point.
1417099424657022980 2021-07-19 12:30:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Probably @dvassallo   I appreciate the way he thinks about living.
1417099315244412931 2021-07-19 12:29:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandondigital Definitely. I went to college and loved it.
1417098519744233477 2021-07-19 12:26:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter is like college, but with better professors.
1416810867925073925 2021-07-18 17:23:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @stefanpalios @jmcmillen89 @RohunJauhar @rohangilkes Dig that well. 100%.   Looking forward to it 🙌🏻
1416795639640465411 2021-07-18 16:22:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thekarangovani Hell yeah. That's a great way to spend a bit of your weekend.   Keep at it, Karan.  🙏🏻
1416779583937040394 2021-07-18 15:19:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sean_specie @jasonvana Oh shit, congrats!
1416778220117049344 2021-07-18 15:13:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Oh 💯  I've got an inbox jammed with notes saying people made $$ after buying a course of mine.  Gold.
1416772449950130178 2021-07-18 14:50:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the_drew Amazing! Glad I could be a small part of the inspiration.
1416767698952990728 2021-07-18 14:31:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SACHIN_RAMJE Love it. Thanks for sharing, Sachin!
1416767650668191745 2021-07-18 14:31:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmoserr When I get a note in my inbox saying how my product helped jumpstart something new like side income, or building a following....rad.
1416765489976680449 2021-07-18 14:23:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's an amazing feeling every time someone buys something you created online.  Spend a little of this Sunday building towards that.   You'll never regret it.
1416206215579901961 2021-07-17 01:20:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Thanks, Nicolas. I’m nowhere near the prolific writer that you are, but I’ll continue to write every single day until I am.   Always appreciate your support 🙏  Cheers.
1416127376522633216 2021-07-16 20:07:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @whit4th Travel.
1416126360498712576 2021-07-16 20:03:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @THETYFRANKEL Appreciate it man.   Launch at $60k in 10 days 👀
1416099552462004231 2021-07-16 18:16:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hansolopreneur Thanks, Ric. Very much appreciated. 🙌
1416058056081870848 2021-07-16 15:32:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano @zeroto1k1 It's basically my whole strategy 😂
1416057978940280837 2021-07-16 15:31:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matttillotson Basically. Me too.
1416057940734320640 2021-07-16 15:31:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dionnecf Love to hear that! Glad I could be impactful in some way. Keep pushing fwd ⚡️
1416044277113757705 2021-07-16 14:37:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mhkaraa Glad it helped. ⚡️
1416038290491379715 2021-07-16 14:13:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto I'm rooting for you, too. ⚡️
1416037142434885634 2021-07-16 14:08:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @atbacher Me too. Just tweeting to myself. 💪🏻
1416036793544282114 2021-07-16 14:07:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @datavisandcomms Sounds like 90% of managers.
1416036426068676616 2021-07-16 14:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zeroto1k1 Mine too. Just tweeting at myself over here
1416034715333799937 2021-07-16 13:59:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cedricstamour Thanks, Cedric. 💪🏻
1416034641081929729 2021-07-16 13:59:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SACHIN_RAMJE The beauty is in the truth, too.
1416033590832418823 2021-07-16 13:54:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I don't know who needs to hear this, but you're overcomplicating it.   Have a great Friday.
1415855075348598784 2021-07-16 02:05:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @katherine_roan If you can do it well, and teach others to do it well...you've got a business.
1415734473526763520 2021-07-15 18:06:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SidelineAff It takes us all a long time, unfortunately.
1415671725417586698 2021-07-15 13:56:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Once we realize this, so much action can be unlocked.   Your knowledge IS valuable AND worth paying for.
1415666249678430212 2021-07-15 13:35:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Imene_Maharzi @ArlanWasHere Haha. I'd invest in her in a heartbeat. ❤️
1415665674068897795 2021-07-15 13:32:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Same with advising SaaS founders on sales. Most of what I teach is so obvious to me but so not to them. Which is awesome. It's a massive win/win.
1415665104419495937 2021-07-15 13:30:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Imene_Maharzi @ArlanWasHere Oh, for sure. Certainly not "up and coming" :)   I've been following her stuff forever. Love it 💪
1415663733880274947 2021-07-15 13:25:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJonFedor It's amazing how much money knowledge we all have (and don't take advantage of)
1415663624560029705 2021-07-15 13:24:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zhero_World Oh, 100%. Language is just one...so great.
1415483945584582659 2021-07-15 01:30:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @corprteUnicorn All lowercase name. Ahead of his time.
1415482851869478917 2021-07-15 01:26:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @corprteUnicorn Ellipses X 2!
1415438587194138630 2021-07-14 22:30:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlfieIsaMarsh @alexxmichaelss Yeah we chatted outside! It was great meeting you then.   Love what you're doing man. Thanks for the nice compliment. 💪🏻
1415434774349557760 2021-07-14 22:15:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlfieIsaMarsh @alexxmichaelss I love Alfie!
1415414375490408455 2021-07-14 20:54:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJackForge @sabrinaesaquino Love it. Thanks!  Following now. Cheers.

1415387361488277504 2021-07-14 19:06:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmoserr @BlogElijas Just one more...
1415387255867428873 2021-07-14 19:06:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JayAtSwpely @JaredMcbeath Jay's great. Love his stuff and follow on LinkedIn.  Wasn't following on Twitter. Now I am.

1415386021181657095 2021-07-14 19:01:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nileshsurana @thestartupgyaan Cool, thanks. Gave him a follow to check out his stuff.
1415385651508305925 2021-07-14 19:00:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @LayahHeilpern Just gave her a follow.  Looks like she's a bit ahead of "up and coming" though!
1415385536026513414 2021-07-14 18:59:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmoserr @ctwtn Love that.  Jeremy is putting out fire stuff...

1415384039289147401 2021-07-14 18:53:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MADEKarubiu @meanminji Following.
1415383682723024900 2021-07-14 18:52:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman The obvious choice, really...😉  Thanks, Tom. Love the NFT stuff you're putting out.  (Does calling it "NFT stuff" make me sound out of touch?)
1415383484714176518 2021-07-14 18:51:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WalkerLucas Well played, sir.
1415383243667431429 2021-07-14 18:50:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Who is an up-and-coming creator you would invest $10k in?   (with zero hesitation)
1415345671461289988 2021-07-14 16:21:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CJ_Johnson17th @lapsley_rob I’ve been laughing at this comeback for 10 straight minutes. 😂
1415344930097147904 2021-07-14 16:18:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyOnuoha Well done. 👏
1415331318968299526 2021-07-14 15:24:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmoserr Amazing. Looks like a fantastic product, Jeremy.   Congratulations!
1415313396476547074 2021-07-14 14:13:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brookecmartin Ha. Thanks!
1415312303893909505 2021-07-14 14:08:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GerardDawson3 I figure it's good consistency there. Didn't bring it here...
1415309122480844810 2021-07-14 13:56:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheDharmaDesign Thanks so much.   Following these have helped me tremendously. Glad you enjoyed it.  Cheers.
1415307950432870401 2021-07-14 13:51:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal I appreciate you, my man 🙌  Thanks so much...
1415305327210221577 2021-07-14 13:40:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Well, that's all I've got today.   I hope these tips help you write better content.  If you liked this, feel free to give me a follow.  Or check out my long-form content at  https://t.co/vCOnWlCOTz  I write often about solopreneurship, writing, and creating.  Cheers.
1415305325763129351 2021-07-14 13:40:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ Don't break lines in the middle. Write better lines.  Lines don't  Naturally break  Like this  Learn to shorten your sentences &amp; deliver value fast.   Gimmicks and hacks make you look "gimmicky" and "hacky".
1415305324425216002 2021-07-14 13:40:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/ Good content + bad hook = little readership  You can write the best content in the world, but if you can't get people to stop and read it?  You don't get reap the rewards.  The best way to write good hooks?  Study other great hook writers.
1415305322642558977 2021-07-14 13:40:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Write for a small niche in the beginning  People like to say things like, "I write for founders."  Founders? Which ones?   Tech? Agency? Seed round? Series A? B? Pre-revenue? $100M+? B2C? B2B?  Start small, expand later.  "No niche is too small if it's yours" - Seth Godin.
1415305319794708487 2021-07-14 13:40:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Create a lot of noise, look for signal  Publish early, publish often, and look for what resonates.  Be careful though.  Engagement can be misleading. Look for:  - Comments that indicate a full read - Repeat commenters - Purchases from content
1415305318402203649 2021-07-14 13:40:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Cut 30% to 40% of what you write  There isn't a reward for most words written.  The reward comes when people finish your content and take the intended action.  Try and make a point in as few words as possible.  Need more words to go deep? Go long-form.
1415305317038977031 2021-07-14 13:40:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Choose pronouns  Don't write "at" people.   Write "to" them.  Use words like "you" and "yours" rather than calling people "salespeople" or "marketers".  Make it personal.
1415305314350485507 2021-07-14 13:40:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Use simple words  Nobody wants to grab a thesaurus when reading short-form.  Plus, the more easily you can explain something, the better you understand it.  Stop trying to impress. Start making an impact.
1415305313050193931 2021-07-14 13:40:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Write for mobile  Make sure your content is "chunky".  Use shorter sentences, add some white space, and make it easy to skim.  Tip? Write ON mobile.
1415305311972249610 2021-07-14 13:40:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've done 46M+ impressions on my written content in 2 years.  Here are 10 valuable writing lessons...  [🧵THREAD]

1415287692896657409 2021-07-14 12:30:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Although I didn't leave recently (August of 2019), your content played a major role in it.  I'm a former tech executive who went $0 to $50M ARR and then burned out.  Now, I help creators build out their own businesses to do the same.   Cheers, Daniel.

1415041287133270016 2021-07-13 20:11:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bentossell @nocodedevs “At least you did something worth copying!”  Sure…but how about ya don’t?
1415029261048717314 2021-07-13 19:24:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @JaviEug As much as I love CDMX I’m still new the saas scene down there.
1414938803945545736 2021-07-13 13:24:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dtoddhart Yep. I’ve found it to be the opposite actually.
1414935156205531138 2021-07-13 13:10:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Zhero_World But so often we decide for ourselves that what we have isn’t valuable.   Such a wasted opportunity.
1414934449771405312 2021-07-13 13:07:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kevinbooyens What comes easiest to us is often the thing you can charge the most for.   We just assume everyone knows already...  A missed opp for sure.
1414931373887041541 2021-07-13 12:55:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everything obvious to you is worth money to someone else.  Have a great morning.
1414693021547999238 2021-07-12 21:07:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays 100%.   What’s next, and what is easiest/most automated?

1414356163609628674 2021-07-11 22:49:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jason I see people in my network moving from standard roles with less flexibility to more flexible, creativity and knowledge-driven roles.  Even if you make less, the free time returned is worth more.

1414238672870912003 2021-07-11 15:02:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ReadWrite_Run I can imagine! Appreciate you sharing.   The 50s? Lightning I'm sure...
1414238314006294533 2021-07-11 15:01:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ideaeconomy Appreciate it, John!
1414237125097127945 2021-07-11 14:56:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Well, that's all I've got on my 40th.  While I'm bummed to leave my 30s, my wife always reminds me:  "Not everyone gets to be 40."  If you liked this, feel free to give me a follow.  Have a great weekend.  Cheers.  🎂
1414237123729784839 2021-07-11 14:56:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 20/ Nearly everyone is winging it.  Are some people light-years ahead when it comes to their thing? Of course. Elon, Steve Jobs, etc.  But most people who you admire are still figuring it out.  Every day, just plugging along. As nervous as you are.  Find comfort in that.
1414237122353975301 2021-07-11 14:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 19/ Consistency trumps all traits.  There are lots of skills you can learn.  But as a pure trait?  Consistency is tough to beat.  Athlete, businessperson, creator, etc.  Do your thing every single day and reap the rewards downstream.
1414237121037012998 2021-07-11 14:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 18/ You can't say yes to everyone.  I've learned that saying yes to everyone means saying no to yourself and the people you care the most about.  A 15-minute brain pick with a stranger or 15-minutes more with your spouse?  It should be that easy of a choice.
1414237119694786571 2021-07-11 14:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 17/ Money is not the root of all evil.  Money is simply the key to unlocking whomever you are as a person.  Get your hands on some money so you can be the best version of yourself.   Help other good people get theirs too.  Bad people with money are what's evil.
1414237118281314309 2021-07-11 14:56:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 16/ Time is the single greatest asset.  It's a cliche for a reason.  Of all of the things I wish for, having more time is number one by a long shot.  My 20s moved fast, my 30s moved so much faster.  I wish I would have appreciated time at a much younger age.
1414237116893077509 2021-07-11 14:56:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 15/ Divorce from anyone who drains you.  As I mentioned before, your environment is critical to success.  People either add to your energy or subtract from it.  You'll spend 10x more time dealing with the subtractors.  Cut early.
1414237114149920775 2021-07-11 14:56:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 13/ Don't spend time with people who don't reciprocate.  My therapist put it best when she told me this:  "Reciprocity is an indicator that someone is invested in the relationship."  Thanks, Erin.
1414237112816193538 2021-07-11 14:56:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 12/ If you can't teach yourself, you'll always be a liability.  If people have to spend their time teaching you simple things that you can learn on the internet, you'll always be considered a liability.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living.  Autonomy is a differentiator.
1414237111457222659 2021-07-11 14:56:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 11/ 10% of people will hate what you do no matter what.  I've seen it in every industry and with every creator.  There is a group of people that will always dislike you and your mission. No matter what.  Focus on the 90%. Not the 10%.
1414237110224113669 2021-07-11 14:56:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ There is absolutely nothing wrong with being selfish.  Can you be selfish to a fault? Probably.  If you always put the needs of others over yours (and your families), life will be more difficult.  Give and take.  Or get taken advantage of.
1414237108819005454 2021-07-11 14:56:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/ Everyone has knowledge that other people will pay for  The idea that you have to be an "expert" or have a certificate to teach or sell something is a fallacy.  Expertise is linear.   You can make a living helping those earlier in the journey than you.
1414237107522969600 2021-07-11 14:56:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Getting 1% better at something means leaping millions.  1% of the total internet-connected population is 46M people.  Continue to get 1% better each month, quarter, year, and you're making significant strides in the overall ecosystem.
1414237104708767746 2021-07-11 14:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ The most important skill to learn is how to learn on your own.  Mentors are great, but they are overrated.  Mentors work well when you've reached a ceiling of teaching yourself everything you could possibly know about a subject.  Learn to learn and you're unstoppable.
1414237103278366721 2021-07-11 14:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ It's difficult to build a work ethic without the right environment.  Everyone talks about "hard work" and "outworking the competition".  It's tough to forcefully create this behavior.  Curate your environment and the behavior is a more likely outcome.
1414237102057791493 2021-07-11 14:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Comparing yourself to others is the easiest way to get distracted.  You can only control how successful you are, not how successful someone else is.  Be the best version of yourself, not a better version of someone else.
1414237100791107586 2021-07-11 14:56:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ 100% of people are out for themselves, even if it doesn't appear so.  Most people might find this pessimistic, but I just find it realistic.  Curious about someone's motivation? Look at how they are incentivized.
1414237098056425472 2021-07-11 14:56:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ The 2nd biggest difference between success &amp; failure is persistence.  Successful friends and peers of mine have almost always been doing their "thing" for decades.   Not just years.  Most people give up in the "I suck at this" phase without considering the long game.
1414237096957513734 2021-07-11 14:56:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Today I turn 40.   Here are 20 helpful lessons I've learned during my life.  [🧵THREAD]
1413892497923846144 2021-07-10 16:06:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theothercole The latter.   Had very few expectations. Just took a solo trip away from my family with the hopes that the free time combined with the energy of the city would help produce something.   It wasn’t perfect, but a new product idea emerged.   And I just love it there.
1413891565391646724 2021-07-10 16:03:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theothercole Went to Mexico City for 5 days to be creatively inspired.   Lots of creativity. More tacos.   Highly recommend.

1413560128536723460 2021-07-09 18:06:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stacyannhayles A truly genuine person wouldn't make assumptions about someone after reading one thread without knowing a single thing about them.  But hey...maybe you'll get some engagement, Stacy.  Good luck.

1413074460018630664 2021-07-08 09:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BikoSpeaks Absolutely, Shaka.

1412972020791488513 2021-07-08 03:09:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @William3Willis Appreciate you, my man. You get to 667 yet? :)
1412971403851309056 2021-07-08 03:06:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> As launch night winds down, approaching $28k for the product launch.  Expect to hit $30k, which was my ultimate goal.  So many thanks to all of my 102k+ friends that support me on LinkedIn, especially the 300+ in my private community.   So appreciative ❤️  What a day...G'night.  https://t.co/l1MMgIOTb1
1412957103577341954 2021-07-08 02:09:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StroutMotivateU Polls get extremely high engagement on LinkedIn.  While great for dopamine, they are not very good for building a long-term, tight-knit audience (IMO).
1412953408747806721 2021-07-08 01:55:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MatthewRDoan Appreciate you, my man. What an awesome compliment. Thank you!

1412884755121680385 2021-07-07 21:22:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonmpearl Thanks so much, Jason. It's been a fun 30-month journey.  Your support is legendary.
1412882016274690051 2021-07-07 21:11:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeKedrec  https://t.co/IObPEsR1ji
1412880694821363712 2021-07-07 21:06:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you enjoyed this thread, you should:   1. Follow me, I tweet about solopreneurship and leveraging LinkedIn.  2. Grab my new product, The LinkedIn Operating System if you want to join me.  Coming August 4th.   https://t.co/cEWxLIoROT
1412880692669603840 2021-07-07 21:06:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10/ My thoughts...  Twitter folks dump on LinkedIn all day.  You're almost guaranteed engagement if you do.  But you should consider the alternative.  Hang at the cool kid's table or look for the opportunity?  I'll be over here moving toward $30k.  (Obligatory @Gumroad Shot)  https://t.co/Fuktj0vobR
1412880683232542722 2021-07-07 21:06:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 9/ Collect social proof in real-time  People said incredibly nice things on my LinkedIn post today.  So, I took those compliments and started adding them to my website in real-time.  The conversion started increasing dramatically, almost immediately.  This was huge.  https://t.co/BseKrVaJMM
1412880672277123074 2021-07-07 21:06:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 8/ Then hit your email list  I followed up with an 8:15a email to 6,900 people.  So far, have a 45% open rate, which is one of my best.  I use Ghost to deliver it cleanly to their inbox and wrote some "curtain copy" to entice.  $5,500 through email.  https://t.co/C8op8obIDT
1412880662323818498 2021-07-07 21:06:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7/ Engage like hell  I spent 6 hours engaging with nearly every comment that came my way.  I answered every DM.  I answered every email.  All of this upfront effort will pay off downstream.  https://t.co/XSGGAgQByi
1412880652756652032 2021-07-07 21:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6/ Prepare your one ask  First, I published a LinkedIn post at 7:15a to my 102k followers promoting my new course.  30 seconds later, I asked my private Discord community (of LinkedIn followers) to support it.  I maybe make this ask ONCE a year.  https://t.co/mTdoFQqtXU
1412880643088785408 2021-07-07 21:06:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5/ Use the profile effectively  The "featured section" part of your LinkedIn profile is prime real estate to feature CTAs.   For today's launch, I primed it to reflect the product I released.  Then I drove people to my website with the next step...  https://t.co/R9plFxrnDI
1412880634347880451 2021-07-07 21:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4/ Be consistent + patient  I've posted every weekday for about 30 months.  I've been consistent with my niche, and patient while I grew.  Having 102k potential customers is extremely powerful.  When I make an ask?   💰
1412880633056010240 2021-07-07 21:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3/ Be bold  Everyone is bold on Twitter because that's the culture.  LinkedIn is buttoned up.  But it doesn't have to be...  I stick out like a sore thumb because everyone else is worried about their boss.  Come say something mildly polarizing &amp; watch what happens.
1412880631713861632 2021-07-07 21:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2/ Pick a sub-niche  I know it's hip and ironic to say that a niche doesn't matter, but every person saying that has no following.  Go deep on one subject.  Just like Twitter, be the:  "Writing guy" "Crypto guy" "SEO girl"  Same as Twitter. Works there. Works on LinkedIn.
1412880630426193924 2021-07-07 21:06:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1/ Treat LinkedIn like Twitter  LinkedIn has notoriously hacky content. So what?  That's YOUR advantage.  Instead of sharing boring job posts or resumes, come drop knowledge and teach.   Opportunity is literally everywhere.
1412880629302063104 2021-07-07 21:06:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter: LinkedIn sucks!  Me: $20k product launch in 9 hours.  All LinkedIn. Zero ads.  Here's how I use LinkedIn unlike anyone else.  [🧵THREAD]

1408502121973129218 2021-06-25 19:07:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush @tferriss Absolutely awesome. Congrats, Dickie. Cheering you and @Nicolascole77 on from Nashville. Keep it going, fellas.
1407361905598025728 2021-06-22 15:36:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmoserr Thank you for this condensed amazingness. 🙌
1407361192742600706 2021-06-22 15:33:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmoserr This is an absolute gem. Book. Marked.  🔥
1407029769590525959 2021-06-21 17:36:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays Pay it off every Friday AM.
1406381172939165697 2021-06-19 22:39:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dan_copy @Nicolascole77 Right. But that’s just another way to describe a niche…  https://t.co/G7Itiz66mt
1406374287091638276 2021-06-19 22:12:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 I think you’re both correct.   The idea that you can’t “find a niche” isn’t true. There are plenty of ideal customers in a very specific niche, waiting to be served a solution to their problems.  You can also create one and teach people why they need what you’re providing.
1405947357317971976 2021-06-18 17:55:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ejordanill @jackbutcher Nice. I lived on Westside Ave &amp; MLK for the last 3 years, just left for Nashville. Enjoy that course, Eric!  Happy Father's Day. Cheers.

1403880802874793989 2021-06-13 01:04:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf @boburnham From a creative perspective, it’s one of the best things I’ve watched in years.   The laughs were just a bonus.   I feel like this is the future of creating online.
1403845658986135554 2021-06-12 22:44:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ideaeconomy Appreciate you including me in the newsletter, John. Cheers. 🍻
1403758071105605645 2021-06-12 16:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HackItMax Oh gosh. I hope he’s ok. That’s awful news. Thanks for letting me know.
1403757340390735881 2021-06-12 16:53:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HackItMax What’s this in reference to?
1403743998292942850 2021-06-12 16:00:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @InspiredByWayne I didn't, no. I wanted to have real-time conversations, plus I don't particularly like Facebook as a company.
1403542504448876548 2021-06-12 02:39:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Was a lot of fun on this end, man. Thanks for providing so much value to the audience. Great strategic and tactical advice.
1403151620179955712 2021-06-11 00:46:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MuhamedSci You should have an email from me. Check your spam just in case.
1402735949482766341 2021-06-09 21:14:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcilmarketing @Dmurr68 Ha. It's not really meant to be savage per se.  The vacation message has links to all sorts of free stuff I've created, my paid courses, coaching calls, my community, etc.  Most LinkedIn DMs are just asks for my time, so this handles it well.
1402735530949939207 2021-06-09 21:13:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegetssocial That's cool. I spend a lot of my time helping people, so the word "grift" stung a bit.   It's the opposite of what I stand for.  I do believe lots of people buy "stuff" because that's just our culture...but that's just my thoughts. Doesn't make them right.  Cheers, Dave.
1402734467849064452 2021-06-09 21:08:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 I put up an away message and redirect them to my email...which has a vacation message up permanently.
1402712710043815937 2021-06-09 19:42:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegetssocial @FindTroy It's weird to call a suggestion that people build something of their own a "grift" when you run a marketing service for small business owners...
1402707350977495042 2021-06-09 19:21:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FindTroy @InspiredByWayne I’ve done both in my life.   #2 has certainly been more rewarding.
1402699611362504705 2021-06-09 18:50:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 FWIW, I like Discord. They desperately need threads, but Slack is just too "worky" for me. I want this to be fun.
1402699466197643264 2021-06-09 18:49:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @jmcmillen89 That's how I felt about it.  My audience is on LinkedIn, and that's basically async chat already. I post something. They comment. I comment back later.  Part of the whole value prop is conversation.
1402634833956950016 2021-06-09 14:32:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel Thanks, Jessie. Appreciate the read and share. Cheers.
1402614975366062081 2021-06-09 13:14:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman Thanks, Tom! Appreciate you intro'ing me to much of the tech that I'm using. Cheers 🍻
1402614321075548163 2021-06-09 13:11:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Well...that's all so far folks.  If you enjoyed this thread, you should:   1. Follow me. I tweet once or twice a week about my solopreneur journey.  2. Subscribe to my free newsletter where I break down audience and income growth tactics.   https://t.co/64c9cl975Z
1402614319808843780 2021-06-09 13:11:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7// You must market hard  I don't just mean to get people onto your waitlist, or interested. I mean marketing to people who have already expressed interest.  People are busy. They forget to apply. They forget to pay.  72-hour, 24-hour, and 2-hour reminders work wonders.
1402614318403751938 2021-06-09 13:11:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6// The community software space needs help  If you want synchronous conversation, you're left hacking together a bunch of tools.   - Member directory - Resource center - Events - Real-time conversation  IMO, there is not a single company doing all of this extremely well.
1402614316994469889 2021-06-09 13:11:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5// It's super rewarding  We already have dozens of member wins, stories of new business being closed, and people seeing dramatic growth in their social media audience.  It feels amazing to be helping people that put their trust in me.
1402614315606175747 2021-06-09 13:11:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4// It's time-consuming.  I spend about 10 hours per day working in the community, which is a lot given the current MRR.  The upside is that more members don't necessarily equal more work. As this scales, I believe internal community management will provide me with more time.
1402614314188513281 2021-06-09 13:11:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3// Synchronous conversation is intense.  We chose Discord because I had a hypothesis that synchronous conversation would be important.  It seems to be proving out true so far, but there are certainly complaints about it being overwhelming.   I wish I had done more research.
1402614312829480962 2021-06-09 13:11:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2// Early culture is key  We put people through a robust application process to deeply understand who they are.  We set expectations 3x on who should join and who shouldn't. We emphasized the importance of creativity, participation, etc.  Our first 2 cohorts are amazing.
1402614311575384064 2021-06-09 13:11:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1// Outcomes matter  It's critical that everyone is focused on the same outcome.   I have ~100k followers on LinkedIn, so some people applied just to hang out.  Those members tend not to engage because the daily outcomes we're working towards aren't why they joined. Be thorough.
1402614309205594117 2021-06-09 13:11:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My private community passed $4k MRR in less than 4 weeks.  230+ members chatting in real-time on Discord.  Some things went well.  Others? Not as much.  Here are 7 takeaways from my first month as a community builder. //thread🧵//  https://t.co/Q1J7Nlt2gp

1400452494778535943 2021-06-03 14:01:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WalkerLucas @kyleplacy Probably. But there are a few 😀
1400451532248608777 2021-06-03 13:57:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy For every person I’ve coached from entry level sales to the Executive suite, there’s another person who hates my guts.   There is a fallacy around being loved by everyone because it sounds nice in a book or blog post.

1399732683723493376 2021-06-01 14:20:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool It's like your lead scorer hating your point guard.   Silly.

1398731071521501191 2021-05-29 20:00:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kingermukesh I mean real honesty and transparency.
1398730499519094794 2021-05-29 19:58:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Social media is not much different than mass media.   Well crafted, intentionally designed narratives to an audience of people ready to eat it up.  There is a huge opportunity for 100% transparency in the market.  Who will capture it?

1397987671390130176 2021-05-27 18:46:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @briannekimmel I live in Nashville and you nailed it. Great place to work remote.  Interesting museums, live music venues, businesses are open, great beer and food cultures.  A bonus? Tons of nature.
1397940688084426753 2021-05-27 15:40:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lennysan @shanebreslin @BGroat I second this. I wrote every morning for 300+ mornings and showed people how to actually get better at things before I ever asked for a cent.   I was in the fortunate position of being employed throughout that part of my journey.

1392287533426520065 2021-05-12 01:16:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis So happy to have you as a part of it, Edward.   Enjoying watching your journey and happy to help support it.
1392286287282024452 2021-05-12 01:11:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Tgunner14 Super excited, Tom. Thanks for being a part of it.
1392286114149449729 2021-05-12 01:10:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tweetsbyejordan Thanks man. Super stoked.
1392285717477433344 2021-05-12 01:09:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Took my private creator community live today.   156 members from 18 countries just jamming on Discord.   Couldn't be happier with the results.  Community is where it's at.
1391848401772457986 2021-05-10 20:11:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst  https://t.co/Pkb2ulicW0
1391783989556436996 2021-05-10 15:55:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel @TeamJohnH Definitely.   My goal is to use as few tools as possible. Challenge is finding something with high-energy synchronous conversation combined with other useful tools like email, member directories, repositories, subscriptions, etc. Just doesn't seem to exist.
1391777486430683137 2021-05-10 15:29:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @MissJaymeB Send her our best! 💪🏻💪🏻
1391777349482516489 2021-05-10 15:29:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessievbreugel @TeamJohnH Nice. I'm carrd + outseta + Discord + Crowdcast + MailerLite + Airtable. 🤦🏼‍♂️
1391016139887718401 2021-05-08 13:04:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl IMO still needs to feel more like a painkiller.  The first sentence calls out frustration but by the time I'm done reading it, I should be feeling it more in my chest.  I should be saying, "Wow, I MUST have this book", because this guy gets my challenges.  Just my two cents.
1391014238068658179 2021-05-08 12:56:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl I often gravitate towards text that highlights my challenges and attaches emotions to them.  Pain + amplification of pain can ultimately feel existential. (A bit harsh of course)  I feel like adding some of this could better get the prospective reader to lean in and take notice.
1390761422712229888 2021-05-07 20:12:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fultlt Do you mean step one, creating the meat of the content?
1390465820388732929 2021-05-07 00:37:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays @gillideon Thanks, man. My first product I did a great job at this, but made my 2nd one a bit too long. Completion rate much lower but still great response and reviews.   Ya live and you learn.
1390363015825043457 2021-05-06 17:49:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman Congrats, Tom!
1390141119925833730 2021-05-06 03:07:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy I know very few marketing leaders who understand sales.   I know very few sales leaders who understand marketing.  Almost none of them understand customer success.   “Marketing Twitter” got ya’ll way too confident. 😉
1390086265266188290 2021-05-05 23:29:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thepatwalls @businessbarista @tobi Love me some starter story.
1390069379782557705 2021-05-05 22:22:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 "That's easier said than done."  Isn't everything?
1389667040747823105 2021-05-04 19:43:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @whatsyouryat Just DM’ed you a code to move up and buy one.
1389342042443194368 2021-05-03 22:12:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush  https://t.co/mZIGGI4xoM
1389303694093656071 2021-05-03 19:39:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @derrickreimer @scottbsales @Ashwin_7 @Calendly @savvycal_ Shitty outreach and the power dynamic associated with calendar links are 2 different things though.   Nobody likes shitty outreach.   People with big egos dislike calendar links.
1389301199309090817 2021-05-03 19:29:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ashwin_7 @scottbsales @Calendly @savvycal_ It’s not the average user who hates it. It’s mostly VCs and CEOs (painting with a broad brush though)
1389298579483893763 2021-05-03 19:19:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales It’s incredible the ego it must take to hate on a win/win, efficient, organizational tool. But, I see it all of the time.
1388592680939266050 2021-05-01 20:34:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @whatsyouryat I do.  I’ll send over.
1388530376403005440 2021-05-01 16:26:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy Build a barrier on top of the nest using sticks and logs, the same way you might build a fire in a fire pit.   Shred up some grass and cover the sticks and let them be.   Keep your dogs away.
1387899321278926849 2021-04-29 22:39:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NaveenDewda @Edition_so @SlackHQ I am. I’d love to learn more about what you offer. I’ll DM you.
1387879160933240840 2021-04-29 21:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NaveenDewda @Edition_so @SlackHQ Any chance you integrate with Discord?
1387835175988510720 2021-04-29 18:24:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tyleramarcus @mcilmarketing Sure, but the content here on Twitter can be terrible as well...it just feels weird how much hatred there is.  It feels slightly elitist, to be honest.
1387814681742610438 2021-04-29 17:02:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcilmarketing I'm not sure.   It's weird to spend SO much time hating on something that you feel is inferior...
1387782350772256769 2021-04-29 14:54:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henrystanley Ahh. Shield Analytics.
1387774676894617610 2021-04-29 14:24:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tweetsbyejordan @CircleApp Appreciate it! If I was going for asynchronous communication it’d be a top choice.
1387774284039397379 2021-04-29 14:22:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tweetsbyejordan @CircleApp Circle is clean and easy but doesn’t have the energy I’m going for.
1387761030588207108 2021-04-29 13:29:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @henrystanley I think it’s called ShotSnapp
1387749498735276037 2021-04-29 12:43:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThatChristinaG Yes please. Launching mine in 2 weeks.
1387728629707182080 2021-04-29 11:21:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OpheDuvillard Looks awesome. Let me know when it's in English! :)
1387708707564310533 2021-04-29 10:01:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Always happy to help. It's a great question.
1387706325220663296 2021-04-29 09:52:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Advisor: Provides advice, generally ad hoc. i.e. call me if you are making a tough decision.  Consultant: Generally works on a project &amp; provides a deliverable. i.e. set up this CRM  Coach: Works 1:1 with a person to develop skills over a period of time with an outcome in mind.
1387703818255835136 2021-04-29 09:42:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman @geneva Yeah, definitely.  Still feels like a major opportunity to build a true all-in-one.  Checking out Geneva now. Thanks, Tom!
1387702053250740225 2021-04-29 09:35:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rosiesherry @OrbitModel This looks really interesting. Checking it out now.  Thank you, Rosie!
1387699812561309696 2021-04-29 09:26:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @anthilemoon @mrbenjaminhoppe @CircleApp I would personally prefer asynchronous conversation, but I've seen too many creators make the move and lose the energy of Slack/Discord, which their members didn't love.  Appreciate the note on Circle. I would love to be wrong about it because it's clean and easy to use.
1387597970598674433 2021-04-29 02:41:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realdavidlobo Super interested.
1387561440874319876 2021-04-29 00:16:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @seempaq @Discordapp Yes please. This what I want.   I love discord. I just need more membership features.
1387560447772176385 2021-04-29 00:12:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mrbenjaminhoppe @CircleApp IMO, zero of this.  Very low engagement.   No events platform unless you integrate with Luma.  No member directory.   No resource center.   Sorry I just don’t get any circle hype.
1387557120401420290 2021-04-28 23:59:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @spencerfry @mattragland @podia If you build this, I will come.
1387556921604022274 2021-04-28 23:58:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CPAAccelerator I'm talking about a creator community, i.e. real-time online chat/audio/video with your community members like Slack/Discord.
1387556683770212354 2021-04-28 23:57:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SideBizGuy Yep - these pains are exactly why I wrote this.  Give me a true all-in-one solution for managing a community, not some Zapier-hacked-together-nonsense coupled with manual member kicking :)
1387555653271625728 2021-04-28 23:53:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SideBizGuy How do you revoke access when someone cancels their membership?
1387555060628996098 2021-04-28 23:51:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SideBizGuy Part of a community is the ability to share relevant resources amongst the members (IMO) so looking for that as a feature.
1387554216336629764 2021-04-28 23:47:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SideBizGuy Topics (as far as I can tell) leads to an ability to post, create a poll, write an article, etc.  I'm looking for a Google Drive-style resource center that isn't...well..Google Drive.  https://t.co/QexxiemgwS
1387553238396833792 2021-04-28 23:44:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ginab @Ali_Merchant @JWellsCFO @MightyNetworks I'm super impressed with MN.   I just wonder how it will grow (especially given the recent funding announcement) to truly be the flexible solution for creators.  I'd love more flexibility in resources/directory management.   But, honestly, it's the best I've found.
1387551919628066825 2021-04-28 23:38:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MightyNetworks I'd be happy to use MN if they met my needs re: member director flexibility, ability to navigate a resource center, and interaction.   Happy to chat with someone there to see if I'm missing something.
1387551340247855105 2021-04-28 23:36:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JWellsCFO  https://t.co/PykJDTx5wh
1387551230357016581 2021-04-28 23:36:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant @JWellsCFO @MightyNetworks @ginab I've tried MN.   - Not a great resource center solution. - The member directory lacks significant flexibility - Energy is low compared to Slack/Discord  Happy to be very, very wrong about all of this.
1387550286697336834 2021-04-28 23:32:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SideBizGuy How do you host a resource center that is easily navigable in MN?
1387549202578911233 2021-04-28 23:28:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JWellsCFO - Interactive platform - Member directory - Resource center - Events  On top of this, I don't want a third party billing software that can't kick people if they churn.
1387548363676082176 2021-04-28 23:24:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Request:  An all-in-one creator community platform.  I don't know a creator running a successful community that isn't hacking it with a bunch of point solutions.  I'm open to pleasant surprises though.
1387173302586773505 2021-04-27 22:34:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher Damn dude. That’s a nightmare.   Sending good vibes and hopes your way.   Of all the stuff on Twitter to get suspended, this?? Ridiculous.
1387083639767371786 2021-04-27 16:38:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ishverduzco @hackthehood Most people jump on a consulting call and then update their profile to flex.   It's a flexy world out there. 🤷‍♂️
1387082933475946498 2021-04-27 16:35:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ishverduzco I advise for a living.   If you're doing it right, you can't be employed full-time.
1386801360352464897 2021-04-26 21:56:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TrentAnders0n @KieranMajury @ScottDikkers Fantastic post. Love the takeaways and feel honored to be featured.  Thank you 🙌🏻
1386734347697405956 2021-04-26 17:30:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @L_Coull Curiosity + willingness to act.   When students want to learn, but are also willing to add self-education to the education the teacher is providing, you have a great student.
1386705190594793474 2021-04-26 15:34:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @_Sales_Rebel_ Happy to chat through this.   I have a folder of over 500+ people telling me how the courses have changed the outcome of their success on social media and in making some income online.  Always happy to share those stories.
1385328693229281287 2021-04-22 20:24:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JuiceboxCA I'm surprised most of Twitter could pull themselves away from being hip and ironic long enough to dunk on someone with less than 1k followers.
1383775025396817926 2021-04-18 13:30:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @atsaminathan @danielmh13 @growth_student @HatchKolby @mkhundmiri @MeetKevon @srushtiuniverse @aaditsh @jmoserr @TeamJohnH @CJ_250marketing @samanthalcc @EliusSantos @jadesai94 Appreciate that 🔥
1383047265753911301 2021-04-16 13:18:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach Of all of your fabulous tweets, this one is my favorite.
1383036341534003200 2021-04-16 12:35:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency Don't yell directly at me so early in the morning.
1383030171373076481 2021-04-16 12:11:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arvidkahl @gumroad Awesome day, man. Congrats 🔥
1383029328800272387 2021-04-16 12:07:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SASHATEED Free info ≠ step-by-step guide to creating something meaningful
1382468777829339136 2021-04-14 23:00:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Haha. Put you in a tough position.
1382467793749168128 2021-04-14 22:56:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat I don't consider my guides "step-by-step". I consider them guidance that requires a smart and action-based person to execute.  I just think you're much smarter than the average person and unafraid of action.   Thoughts?
1382466759261818882 2021-04-14 22:52:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcilmarketing Ha. I need to @ everyone (myself included)
1382465591622131713 2021-04-14 22:47:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Anything worth accomplishing doesn't have a step-by-step guide on the internet.
1382448939547385862 2021-04-14 21:41:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @benbarbersmith I have 2,551 paying customers with 17 refund requests, so about 0.7%  My advice is low-cost, easily consumable, high-value digital products.
1382397695915130885 2021-04-14 18:17:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson I agree with that. That’s a poor student.
1382397648397815809 2021-04-14 18:17:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bartszczepansky @jadesai94 Exactly. Mostly it’s about opening up and giving things a chance.
1382397549164789761 2021-04-14 18:17:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drjonmusic Yep. Teaching requires a two way relationship.
1382381118486409216 2021-04-14 17:11:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jadesai94 Huge advantage.   It's advantageous to learn how to learn.
1382380179276886027 2021-04-14 17:08:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone is looking for the best teacher.  Very few people are becoming better students.
1382096273659019266 2021-04-13 22:20:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drjonmusic @DcapoVGM I guess I just think about perfection as unattainable.  I'll never attain it...so why strive for it?  I'd rather put out something that 60% of people love and 40% of people don't. And do it a lot. And learn a lot.  At least I know my 60% tribe...  Not sure if that makes sense?
1382078555748716548 2021-04-13 21:09:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 @allisonbraley Chicago to eat at Alinea Tulum Mexico City x 2
1382078468201062402 2021-04-13 21:09:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley We call those, "Nose to tail".
1382077672549974017 2021-04-13 21:06:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley I booked 4 vacations instantly. 🌴
1382077533089333255 2021-04-13 21:05:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcilmarketing Also, remember that all advice is contextual.  This worked for me, and some other folks I know, but maybe not for you.  Experiment. Everyone is different.
1382075361299726339 2021-04-13 20:56:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcilmarketing Package one of those into a $99 course.  If someone reaches out and asks you to do a call, tell them they can buy the course for $99 or take a call for $199.
1382075137592340481 2021-04-13 20:56:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mrcabasvidani SaaS sales SaaS leadership LinkedIn Growth Side Hustle stuff  That's it so far
1382057527353966594 2021-04-13 19:46:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcilmarketing What are you selling?
1382043060335415301 2021-04-13 18:48:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fultlt I don't. Whomever you are creating for does.  Are people engaging? Sending you DMs saying they love it? Writing you emails asking you more questions? Mentioning you in Tweets/posts/blogs, etc...?
1382042772459417602 2021-04-13 18:47:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mcilmarketing I would, yes.   Build an affordable product ($50) They need more help? Offer a more expensive call ($129)  Just examples.
1382042589168295936 2021-04-13 18:46:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MundoViews @itsKostasOnFIRE I didn't see it, but sounds awesome.
1382042524341170176 2021-04-13 18:46:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MargaretRyland I think there should be many signals before creating a product. I'm sure other people would disagree.  Creating for over a year before I "asked" worked well for me.
1382029043160211461 2021-04-13 17:52:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JeroenVDLoock Awesome! Glad to hear you're enjoying it.
1382028975569043456 2021-04-13 17:52:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itsKostasOnFIRE It doesn't have to be one year, that just worked really well for me. I think people want to rush it.
1382028881390100481 2021-04-13 17:52:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SACHIN_RAMJE I don't think you should shorten it...I think it's worthwhile to put in the time, IMO.  I like to launch an asset once a lot of people have asked me the same question over and over.  Then, I presell.
1382028684698267649 2021-04-13 17:51:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikaelfyi I built products/assets that were way too long and I let technology be a bottleneck, instead of keeping it simple.  Re: false, I realized you don't have to be an "expert" to make a sale. Just further along on your journey.
1382026670849282058 2021-04-13 17:43:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Building a small income stream is simple, but not easy.  My best advice?  Don't overcomplicate it.  - Create valuable content for a year. - Listen to what questions people ask. - Solve their question with a digital asset. - If they need more, offer a short call.  Keep it simple.

1382000122280747022 2021-04-13 15:58:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luqmaansa @SeanAnthonySays Depends. If people believe it takes 7 hours to solve a particular problem then maybe. I've found that people enjoy brevity, especially if it helps them solve a challenge in 30 minutes or less.  Outcomes vs. time
1381995255684284419 2021-04-13 15:38:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @SeanAnthonySays Thank you! 🙌
1381992415989538822 2021-04-13 15:27:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @SeanAnthonySays $30 to $50. I think more about outcome achieved than length of course.
1381987401988501507 2021-04-13 15:07:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays I know this to be true. My first course was 75-minutes long and has a 60% completion rate. My second was 3.5 hours and has a 40% completion rate. Need to get closer to 30-45.
1381957178274295808 2021-04-13 13:07:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @5harath Thanks, my man!
1381749395146833921 2021-04-12 23:21:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattlady Be calm. Be slow.   Realize the audience is filled with people who want to hear what you have to say.   It’s not an audition. It’s a support group.   Be real. Don’t know something? Say you’ll figure it out and get back to them.
1381745675772293120 2021-04-12 23:06:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool Even becoming acquaintances will work to start. Just show up and give a bit.   Add to the conversation. Connect. Help.   Friendship takes time.   Transactional is what you do when you don’t understand the long game is even possible.
1381740043216228357 2021-04-12 22:44:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianSexton13 Thanks, Brian. You as well, bud. Cheers 🍻

1381731462072963075 2021-04-12 22:10:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichellCClark If there is a group of folks feigning interest, my opinion is that that they are in the minority.  Most people are interested in furthering their own beliefs.   Not understanding the beliefs of others.

1381670030652358658 2021-04-12 18:06:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort I feel like this is all very meta and I missed it.
1381669195931324416 2021-04-12 18:03:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort To me, approaching a scenario without any interest in how the other side feels or why they feel that way is so strange.   I’m usually naturally curious as to how 2 people could be so far apart on one topic.

1381636016491139072 2021-04-12 15:51:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau Most people don’t even fake curiosity. They just simply aren’t interested in why other people feel the way they do.
1381602186317213696 2021-04-12 13:36:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy Loved doing this especially when I was running a pacific coast team from the east coast.  I woke up at 5am (2a PT) and knew I had 7 hours before my team even walked into their office.  Magic.

1379153111579832324 2021-04-05 19:24:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Nasvhille real estate high already. Bought my house for $287 a sq. ft and it's over $300 now.  Chattanooga is beautiful &amp; much cheaper, plus has a good tech scene with companies like Ambition. @BTrautschold could probably add more.  Want to buy a place together in Boise? :)

Low-cost, good people, decent climate, low natural disaster rate, improving food scenes, decent tax rates, etc.

I'll just write a bunch of nonsense just to keep my streak going.  Outside of the few hours I spend daily writing and creating, I have specific hours for client work.

1377293716772257799 2021-03-31 16:16:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickStagge I’d prefer optimism in the face of reality vs pessimism.
1377271136610832393 2021-03-31 14:46:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @landforce @DrewbixMusic It could, but this was more a figure of speech to highlight the speed at which optimists move into action.
1377269799462576134 2021-03-31 14:41:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrewbixMusic @landforce Definitely. I usually had “fail fast” metrics installed.
1377262445446725633 2021-03-31 14:12:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scholz_felix Take a lot of people a long time. I wasn't always the optimist.  Became one when I realized most problems can be solved with some creativity + optimism.
1377262294237872130 2021-03-31 14:11:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tibo_maker I like being the person that says, "how can we?" in a room of "Here's why this won't work..."
1377261947331174405 2021-03-31 14:10:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BenjaminPutano I'm generally the optimist and have been through plenty of moments of being "wrong". It can be embarrassing.  In the end, when you get it right? 10x the feeling in the opposite direction.
1377261531436552194 2021-03-31 14:08:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EhabJames I've been surrounded by pessimists in a situation that requires optimism. It's brutal.
1377260994368573440 2021-03-31 14:06:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Optimism is a business superpower.   Optimists solve problems before pessimists finish talking about why it can’t be done.
1377035705327697926 2021-03-30 23:11:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyblake Haha..I didn't really need a clarification but I appreciate it.  I'm glad that you became an "electronic person" 🙌
1377035064094175233 2021-03-30 23:08:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyblake I'm getting a lot of mixed messages between football and basketball here.  Can you please clarify?
1377033890464940035 2021-03-30 23:03:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisWalker171 Exactly what I'm trying to do.  You on the Twitter now? 🙏
1376926219271340033 2021-03-30 15:56:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HackItMax So proud to be a part of this, Max. Thanks for giving me the option. Keep up the great work. 🚀
1376896186041430017 2021-03-30 13:56:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hi_rankin I moved to TN from CA and I can vacation the entire blazing summer with the tax savings ☀️ was a no brainer. (I still miss good sushi and Mexican food)
1376882957798023173 2021-03-30 13:04:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lots of people love the outcomes and hate the inputs.  That's a backward life right there.
1376684079823872003 2021-03-29 23:53:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @siudavid_ @jmikolay You won't regret it. Appreciate you!
1376683171635466242 2021-03-29 23:50:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm not sure there is a better aggregator of high-quality conversation than Justin.  His ability to listen, organize, and distribute is really impressive.   A must-follow, IMO.
1376663745909424128 2021-03-29 22:33:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf @5harath @5harath you're getting so much great love lately.   Couldn't happen to a cooler (and better) dude.   Congrats!
1376601642209017861 2021-03-29 18:26:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattxml Probably. It’s just weird bc I went there with the sole intention of business. I just couldnt get in the zone. Maybe the idea of fun was just too distracting?
1376567670808711171 2021-03-29 16:11:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto Congrats, Aaron. Looking forward to following your journey.
1376543414695649286 2021-03-29 14:34:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IGrabill I think it's partly the pressure. When creativity and alone time hit at the same time, I have to harness the hell out of it.
1376542107721170946 2021-03-29 14:29:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickStagge Ha. Same here.   "Oh...there it is."  Probably what happened with my epiphany.
1376541645789872133 2021-03-29 14:27:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @valsopi I feel like it very much could be.  Like my brain was just locked for 72 then opened up on the car ride home.  Was the retreat a success? Debatable.
1376541114270945282 2021-03-29 14:25:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JWellsCFO Yeah, that's better. Ha.
1376540608546885638 2021-03-29 14:23:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @studioofchange It was not tremendous, tbh. But, that's ok. Next time!
1376540477596565522 2021-03-29 14:23:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JWellsCFO Maybe vacation wasn't the right word, but it was a trip specifically meant to focus on my business.
1376540313846743041 2021-03-29 14:22:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @studioofchange That's what I learned, the hard way, this past weekend. I guess you simply can't force the creativity...
1376539538076663811 2021-03-29 14:19:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's hard to plan "deep work."  I went on vacation this weekend specifically to focus on my business.  For the entire 72 hours, I struggled.  On the ride home, feeling dejected, I had an epiphany that I'm now working on back at home.  The lesson? When the moment hits, grab it.
1376341377731166208 2021-03-29 01:12:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush This 👆🏻  Started writing each morning almost 3 years ago.  Just show up. Produce what’s expected. Every single day.  That’s it...
1376274892329484297 2021-03-28 20:47:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MJ_Macchiarelli @gumroad Thanks, Mike!
1376274790160404486 2021-03-28 20:47:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SensitiveBiz Thanks so much, Caroline. I catch myself in the same lie. “Everyone has already heard this...” but we know that’s not true. This always helps me stay on point.
1376177374950211588 2021-03-28 14:20:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 @AliQOfficial I don’t have much experience with either. I’m a Ghost user and enjoy it aside from some minor complications.
1376132584229441542 2021-03-28 11:22:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamjonjackson @Concept2Brand I was referring to monthly recurring revenue, yes.
1376116222429958145 2021-03-28 10:17:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kola_aina Really appreciate the nice shoutout, Kola, and for sharing your story. Keep living your “why” 🔥
1375970655900995587 2021-03-28 00:39:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto Hell, I'm excited for you, Aaron! You deserve this. Keep it going. 🙌
1375905988767801353 2021-03-27 20:22:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I love seeing people Tweet about MRR milestones.   Watching folks build their own freedom in real time is electric ⚡️

1375613196632006657 2021-03-27 00:58:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisRackley Just saw this on Google Maps. Legit?

1375611677551509505 2021-03-27 00:52:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kreigs Heard about this. I think I read that there is a sausage and cheese french toast??
1375607268956381190 2021-03-27 00:35:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjkmccaffrey We’re loving it so far. Insanely cool.

1375606967272677380 2021-03-27 00:33:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamVazquez Headed to Admiral tomorrow. Hell yeah!
1375602307946151943 2021-03-27 00:15:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cld516 Looks super cool. Don’t know if I can fit it in but I’m only a 4 hour drive. Might come back in a few weeks.
1375601554288427011 2021-03-27 00:12:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dalbertcpa @chocolatefetish Someone was just telling me about this. Can’t wait.

1375597947459624964 2021-03-26 23:58:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeKMiami Awesome. Thanks!
1375597899095101443 2021-03-26 23:57:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeKMiami Just walked by this place.
1375596157217468417 2021-03-26 23:50:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I just got to Asheville, NC and this is a little slice of heaven.  If anyone has been here and has recs, LMK.
1375434910891180038 2021-03-26 13:10:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @akshayy27 It's interesting. I haven't...  I probably should. Any chance you could fwd me a specific piece of copy (like this one?)
1375431948924022786 2021-03-26 12:58:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GerardDawson3 Ha. Amazing. I didn't even know that.
1375429374162386949 2021-03-26 12:48:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Really great stuff, Daren.  I'd add to keep it focused on the transformation. Taking people from point A to point B.  Cheers 🔥
1375427134781587462 2021-03-26 12:39:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkhundmiri @copy_ai Given the team of @PaulYacoubian and @heyblake, I think they are going to be a massive success.  I do still believe people will need to know how to write great copy in the end.
1375425352114245634 2021-03-26 12:32:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Writing good copy is the white button-down of marketing.  It will never go out of style.  A true classic.
1375228606281039876 2021-03-25 23:30:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy @awilkinson 75 with a slighter lean towards wine and beer?
1375219017762414609 2021-03-25 22:52:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @awilkinson I don’t know, because I’m not 69.   Great question, though.
1375204647925858308 2021-03-25 21:55:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LenaSesardic @gumroad @ajlkn Interesting. I haven’t found that to be a problem. Might retest?  Anyways, site looks great!
1375197108068843523 2021-03-25 21:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LenaSesardic @gumroad Lena - have you considered the embedding option built into Carrd for Gumroad rather than redirecting?
1375182424666210310 2021-03-25 20:26:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays @GerardDawson3 @JamesonCamp @justinmooretfam Hey Sean - nice to meet you, and would love to connect. Headed out for a long vacation tomorrow but could do week of April 5. I'll DM ya.
1375156358429995012 2021-03-25 18:43:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GerardDawson3 Excellent point, man. I hadn't considered that specific type of testimonial on the checkout screen. Really interesting.
1375155799803228166 2021-03-25 18:41:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandondigital I sometimes care about features if I'm looking for a specific thing for a reason I've identified as important.  I love testimonials, but they need to be positioned the right way.  "Justin's XYZ is amazing!" is much less helpful than "I used Justin's XYZ and grew my income by 5x."
1375154260074192899 2021-03-25 18:34:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Great social proof shows the transformation of your customers, not the feature of your product they love.  Features might create interest.  But transformation creates sales.
1375151270126882819 2021-03-25 18:23:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jason My ethernet cable + Google Fiber 2 gig has been a game-changer.   10/10. Highly recommend.
1375145815388389385 2021-03-25 18:01:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Feel like @agazdecki is your guy.

1375079269961990147 2021-03-25 13:37:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Plus, it allows you to share your journey publicly.   I've been watching you write for years, so it's been a joy to simply watch you get better and more popular - all in real time.
1375073119673712641 2021-03-25 13:12:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dickiebush It's a great question to ask yourself. I'm hoping you'll share your thoughts as you work through it, Dickie.
1375063663942397957 2021-03-25 12:34:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @akshayy27 Glad you're getting started, Akshay. It Will be something you're glad you did, I promise.
1375048585558044680 2021-03-25 11:35:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SankethYS Addition by subtraction. Keep it simple.
1374827561885241351 2021-03-24 20:56:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichaelWreath @Codie_Sanchez @Twitter Awesome. Thanks, Michael 🔥🔥
1374827422001070082 2021-03-24 20:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IGrabill @dvassallo Advisor: show up to meetings, work through challenges together.   Consultant: physical deliverables and projects.
1374816005571088396 2021-03-24 20:10:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @dvassallo Yep. I don’t do deliverables but I do help founders avoid incredibly expensive mistakes early in their GTM strategy.
1374815785026195463 2021-03-24 20:10:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @walkingriver @dvassallo It’s a great gig. Instead of taking equity I take cash. I push my rates up in my niche because I’m good at what I do in that space. 🤷‍♂️
1374814463724023811 2021-03-24 20:04:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abrowning100 This is exactly what I say to anyone who uses this very dumb statement.
1374814336158433280 2021-03-24 20:04:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo This is why I run a straight advisor vs. consultant model.   No deliverables. No in-betweens.   Just a few meetings with no prep.
1374806916006883328 2021-03-24 19:34:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattlady I’m so sorry, Matt. Been through this a few times and it never gets easier. Only time will heal. Super bummed for you.
1374770870086987779 2021-03-24 17:11:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> "Easier said than done" is what people say when they don't do things.

1374749037086310405 2021-03-24 15:44:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Excellent advice.  I've found the more that I write, the more a clear process helps me keep it succinct.  Print this out. Put it on your monitor.
1374748695388954627 2021-03-24 15:43:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Better yet, optimize for curiosity, hunger, and coachability and install your sales acumen into someone who is going to eat it up.   🔥

1374740640337174535 2021-03-24 15:11:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylevamvouris Correct. We pass back and forth and get to know each other's niches quite well.
1374740106725228546 2021-03-24 15:09:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylevamvouris Sure. Over time, I've created a small Slack channel where I have different consultants that each serves a particular niche.  When any of us come across a client that doesn't fit our ICP, we can share in the channel with the appropriate person.
1374737822951776264 2021-03-24 15:00:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5 simple steps to more $$ in your service business:  • Never turn down a prospect w/o an intro to someone else who can help.  • Jump on a call with that intro.  • Clearly articulate the ICP you serve.  • Create a Slack channel for introductions.  • Repeat.
1374733400989433859 2021-03-24 14:42:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliQOfficial Try my hack until something better is built. Works really well for me.
1374721743273783300 2021-03-24 13:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Let's build it. Could easily distribute via my network there.
1374720749949353985 2021-03-24 13:52:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ifesokiche Sure thing.
1374720716222959619 2021-03-24 13:52:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Yep - used to do this. Bookmarks have made it so much easier and it accelerates growth rapidly.
1374718983664979974 2021-03-24 13:45:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Just sent the latest installment of my newsletter to 4,187 solopreneurs &amp; creators.  - You can read it in 3 minutes - It tells you why LinkedIn has an interaction problem - It shows you how to fix it so you can grow  Read it here 👇🏻   https://t.co/kECa66fjZw

1374435012896989190 2021-03-23 18:56:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman @discord Happy to be in it. 🤜🏻🤜🏻
1374431878489382920 2021-03-23 18:44:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman @discord Just joined, Tom. Looking fwd to chopping it up with some brilliant people and getting very distracted.  🔥🔥🔥
1374430918081835009 2021-03-23 18:40:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThisIsParsons Take action → learn. Simple.
1374430846485024769 2021-03-23 18:40:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @effemegna Act. Observe. Iterate. Observe. Repeat.

1374424968151244801 2021-03-23 18:17:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DrJonMusic 100%. But people are so afraid to start that they read, watch, talk, etc...it's just a stalling technique.   Everything becomes so much more clear with action.
1374423088977256454 2021-03-23 18:09:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @patel_pankaj_ By doing something we learn more than traditional "learning" i.e. reading about it or watching videos about it.
1374421183781769218 2021-03-23 18:02:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When in doubt, take action.  Nothing provides clarity like doing something.
1374408481663422468 2021-03-23 17:11:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dr Congrats Dan!

1374389704540360709 2021-03-23 15:56:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EricJorgenson Came for the Naval.  Stayed for the sandwiches.
1374388883287281673 2021-03-23 15:53:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki As someone who loves the earliest days, I can 100% confirm this is true.  ‣ Move fast ‣ Try a bunch of stuff ‣ Ask a significant number of questions ‣ Whip up marketing materials on Canva ‣ Tell your story to customers - they feel the energy!
1374385678801195012 2021-03-23 15:40:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @coding_2A_Ron Not just the ask, but the disappointment when you say, "Ok - here's what I charge."  Believe me, plenty of people on Twitter have shamed me for thinking I should charge people for my time.  People are wacky.
1374377301492690963 2021-03-23 15:07:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drgurner That's a fair point. Would have to give it some deeper thought to make it a win/win.   Again, this isn't some idea to "get rich". I want to help people succeed and de-risk the investment on my side while being able to make some profit.
1374366257147969540 2021-03-23 14:23:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @drgurner Candidly, I'm not sure, Dr. Garner. Sort of a half-baked idea at the moment.  My goal wouldn't be to get rich here but to make a similar return to any other investment while simultaneously helping someone create a great life and business.
1374362075338801153 2021-03-23 14:07:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NoCodeNerd Exactly. Can I have your product for free even though we don't know each other?
1374361960557469700 2021-03-23 14:06:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tami__mcqueen I offer to pay any friend I have their full hourly rate, no questions asked.  I've even asked them to raise it a bit when I know they are underpricing themselves.  I'm getting tired of free "advice" requests from guys who have raised $50M in capital.
1374360814895968256 2021-03-23 14:02:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MichaelWreath It's a shame people even put artists in that situation.  Whenever I need help from a friend, peer, or former colleague I always say, "Just let me know what you charge for an hour and I'm happy to pay."
1374359007004098565 2021-03-23 13:54:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Asking self-employed people for free work does 2 things:  • Demeans the value of their business • Makes them spend time figuring out how to say no  Let's normalize paying people for their time, please.

1374143347783254017 2021-03-22 23:37:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @janet_yen1 @valsopi This is basically the structure I was thinking through...
1374120014140342276 2021-03-22 22:05:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victorluna @DannPetty Gotcha - thank you and appreciate you sharing.
1374116051332571139 2021-03-22 21:49:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool Ain’t that the truth. 🔥🔥
1374104810056781824 2021-03-22 21:04:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrishlad @shelisademuth @jackbutcher @theothercole Fun to discover great creators. Now just need to figure out how to invest in people legally.
1374103041641750535 2021-03-22 20:57:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @trippingwords Appreciate that. Been engaging daily with folks on LinkedIn for 3 years, so it's just a habit I brought over here.
1374102404027842566 2021-03-22 20:55:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @valsopi I'm not even really thinking about SaaS, tbh. I'm talking about a single creator who might be scaling a community, digital product, cohort-based coaching platform, etc.
1374101947297505286 2021-03-22 20:53:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LucrativeArt What's the pitch?? :)
1374101043030687750 2021-03-22 20:49:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @valsopi Probably three:  1. Scale their audience and product 2. Grow alongside them 3. Earn some income  I don't know about a quick exit. That seems to be the opposite of what I'd want to accomplish.
1374100482214486016 2021-03-22 20:47:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @smacmannis @AlexMasmej Yeah, someone else shared this too. I'm reading about it now. This is exactly the type of thing I've been interested in learning about.
1374100342896521216 2021-03-22 20:47:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TrentAnders0n @ishverduzco @DalosOrtiz @lukecannon727 Great list, Trent. I just added a few of these folks to my follower list. I already got an eye on Luke.

1374099026812018689 2021-03-22 20:41:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattlady @AlexLlullTW Going to take a look into some of the platforms folks have shared on this thread to see what options are out there.
1374098166426001410 2021-03-22 20:38:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hrishio @heybereket Yeah, he's awesome. A future (current) star!
1374098114760560640 2021-03-22 20:38:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith @PeterHollens Not familiar with him. Checking him out now. Thanks, Daren.
1374098003477282830 2021-03-22 20:37:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith I haven't actually looked into it. I don't even understand what the options are at the moment. Just started contemplating it with all of the unique new fundraising going on.
1374097850024464399 2021-03-22 20:37:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW I feel like even a 5k or 10k investment with a rev share agreement could be a win/win, ya know?
1374096764723154949 2021-03-22 20:32:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @smacmannis @AlexMasmej Thank you so much. Going to dive in. Much appreciated.

1374096234290495503 2021-03-22 20:30:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @victorluna @DannPetty When you say invested, mind sharing a bit more?
1374096093978431491 2021-03-22 20:30:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @smacmannis @AlexMasmej I actually haven’t heard of this. I’d love to read up on it though.   I think it’s simply how to get started, maybe?
1374095785743282189 2021-03-22 20:28:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MamdouhMoemin @LiamMews Just gave him a follow to see what he’s all about. Thanks!

1374094866620280834 2021-03-22 20:25:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickB2005 @ChrisWalker171 Thanks man. Had a blast. I’ll take that investment 😉
1374094051897643012 2021-03-22 20:22:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> All I want to do is invest in people.   Not companies. Just individual people.   I've come across so many unique creators.   I think a small check + some guidance would be all they need to get rolling.  If you could invest in one creator, who would it be?
1374091347779579911 2021-03-22 20:11:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh @heyblake @brandonthezhang @dickiebush @heydannymiranda I retweet when something stands on its own and I quote tweet when I need to add some context.   Pretty simple for me.

1374070093513158662 2021-03-22 18:46:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @johnfitch_ 100% on that. I'm considering taking a month off :)
1374060816488599554 2021-03-22 18:10:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Haha. Living through a bored life doesn’t exactly get me all jacked up.
1374060318394048513 2021-03-22 18:08:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Damn that’s a smart quote from Dad. I love it. 🔥
1374059768948604930 2021-03-22 18:05:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JuriaanKarsten Same here. I appreciate consistency more than almost anything. 🔥
1374059622974246918 2021-03-22 18:05:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JonathanAGraham A race worth running!
1374059110203801607 2021-03-22 18:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hrishio One of the toughest to learn.   Goes against everything that we feel in the age of “give it to me now”.
1374058438385307648 2021-03-22 18:00:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Success is an endurance race.  - Everyone can start something. - Most people can go hard for a few weeks. - Some people can stay consistent for a few months.  The long game?   Very uncrowded.
1374049895980670979 2021-03-22 17:26:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GerardDawson3 Position your business as outcomes not hours. That’s what I do on every discovery call with a prospect. Come armed with examples.
1374040292056297473 2021-03-22 16:48:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MattHogan123 I mean create a life where you don't always have to be scaling your business up to survive.   Create a life where instead, you can do less work and make enough to live comfortably.
1374029508697862145 2021-03-22 16:05:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LynGraft Lots of time talk. I like it.
1374028315191693315 2021-03-22 16:00:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Remember:  How you value your time is how others will value it.
1374023474432344065 2021-03-22 15:41:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @studioofchange Definitely. I can't tell you how many conversations I've had with people who had nearly an identical upbringing and career who tell me, "it doesn't work that way for me".

1374015324048220162 2021-03-22 15:09:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann Thanks, Zach. 🙌
1374015275356553221 2021-03-22 15:09:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ericjmlee It's the X factor in pressing "go".
1374015224899117059 2021-03-22 15:08:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EhabJames I've found it nearly impossible to convince otherwise, someone who has already convinced themselves.
1374013008775573512 2021-03-22 15:00:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every successful person I know believes in themself.  Every unsuccessful person I know believes the game is rigged against them.  It's cliché as hell, but mindset is everything.
1373993097202442240 2021-03-22 13:40:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dr Happy to be helpful if I can be, Dan.

1373685931727814666 2021-03-21 17:20:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abrowning100 Even better.
1373671678593613828 2021-03-21 16:23:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OzolinsJanis This is fantastic. Great job, Janis. Looking fwd to more 🔥🔥
1373665812385566730 2021-03-21 16:00:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JWellsCFO Sure, I just mean that income is meaningless without the context of spending. It's why so many athletes are broke as hell.
1373663544915419136 2021-03-21 15:51:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realBrookNash If people think they are going to naturally change their spending habits when they make more, they are fooling themselves.
1373660341838745600 2021-03-21 15:38:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RosserJobs Definitely. But it’s tough to out-earn shitty spending habits.
1373657615658532865 2021-03-21 15:27:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Brag less about income and more about expense reduction.
1373416898730287106 2021-03-20 23:31:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jonathanenlared @testimonialto Signed up recently and have a reminder to dive in. Thanks!
1373360748106244098 2021-03-20 19:48:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lexpaval I guess I use Google Docs so maybe I should just keep my mouth shut 😂
1373356519379582984 2021-03-20 19:31:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh I’m not even sure they take you from 80 to 90.   I feel like it’s an illusion of productivity. Doing a bunch of stuff in a Notion template feels great.   Building something with that time feels better. Just my opinion though.
1373351488777551875 2021-03-20 19:11:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EhabJames The idea that they are somehow a necessary part of a creators stack is weird. If you need a tool to be productive you might not actually enjoy what you’re creating.
1373348761775173635 2021-03-20 19:00:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You don't need productivity tools to be productive.  Just start.
1373344166441259014 2021-03-20 18:42:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @darentsmith Awesome. Drop me a note when it's out 🙌

1372535584518983680 2021-03-18 13:09:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I want to use Twitter in a more valuable way.   Here are some takeaways from recent growth:  → When small, teach don't philosophize. → Provide helpful feedback on people's products. → Create very real connections via direct messages.  All simple, but often overlooked.  https://t.co/wA0qK9dg6i

1372291225907257345 2021-03-17 20:58:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A weird observation about Twitter:  The content from smaller creator accounts is generally more valuable than large accounts.  I want to follow more small creators. Drop your 2-liner below:  → Who you help → What you help them do  Let's upgrade my feed.

1372179939756277764 2021-03-17 13:36:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Thanks, man.   I've told this same story 100x over so I figured I'd at least systematize it in case anyone was interested.
1372179787662422018 2021-03-17 13:35:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realBrookNash Thanks, Brooklin. Weirdly, Gary Vee does a great job at this. Everyone knows the story and some clips from it:  "D and F student" "Was told I'd be nothing" "Built Wine Library to $60M"  If you can pull out clips like this, it's in your brain.
1372179202313715720 2021-03-17 13:33:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kristofberg Agree with you. I’d love to see a better format or opening, but this question seems to be the norm. Might as well have a good story.

1372173447275630597 2021-03-17 13:10:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every podcast interview starts the same way.  "Tell us your backstory."  This is an opportunity to cover your boring resume or tell your story in a compelling fashion. To connect with the audience in a way that's human.  Here's my 7-step process for a compelling backstory.  https://t.co/bCuKfwi6YB
1372171735257251842 2021-03-17 13:03:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland About a year ago, I had a beer with a VC in LA who told me, "Want to go viral on Twitter?"  "Share your productivity hacks or your morning routines."  It's not actually about being helpful. It's simply about engagement.
1371900782958772225 2021-03-16 19:06:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KeevinOrourke At the moment, my wife. I plan on adding some folks to my team later this year as I dive deeper into content creation.
1371879582513643524 2021-03-16 17:42:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hrishio Happens to me all of the time. I'd rather it was great and late than terrible and on time.   But, I'm always shooting for great and on time.
1371879376644620296 2021-03-16 17:41:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bud_budross 100%. I hovered for a minute over the save button and then just deleted and simplified. Now, I'm super pleased.
1371878207222321156 2021-03-16 17:37:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Finished tomorrow's newsletter to 4.1k+ subscribers.  → Reread it  → Hated it → Deleted it → Rewrote it → Love it  Don't send out stuff you aren't proud of.   A second try can give new life to bad work.
1371809143749808128 2021-03-16 13:02:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In a world full of grifters, caring about people is a differentiator.
1371648630340390916 2021-03-16 02:24:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshcolter @tomosman @theSamParr @ShaanVP @myfirstmilpod Appreciate you sharing. Will absolutely check it out.
1371647261202128897 2021-03-16 02:19:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshcolter @tomosman I agree with you. But many communities are built around the popularity of the creator. Some are great. Some? Not so much. Just think we’re going to see a shift here soon in the entire community space.
1371595230143733761 2021-03-15 22:52:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caseywinans @MrJacobEspi @heybereket @jamierusso @mariodgabriele Well, shit thanks, Casey. I appreciate that.
1371595131099418625 2021-03-15 22:52:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndyBlackJnr Appreciate the kind words, Andy. LinkedIn is just like any other platform, IMO. Good users and bad users.   I've really enjoyed building an audience there.
1371505940126646283 2021-03-15 16:57:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nocodedevs Sweet. I'll bite. Let's do it. 🙌
1371496453181485060 2021-03-15 16:20:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Happy to be investing in a product I use &amp; love and a team I believe in.
1371486067321360389 2021-03-15 15:38:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn Not actually sure what it needs to feel like, but different.  I usually don't do this, but I feel comfortable pointing out the problem w/o a solution.  Most communities feel like mini social media platforms w/ a captive audience.  There has to be a better option.
1371480737401147399 2021-03-15 15:17:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency Consumption also tricks you into believing you’re doing work. It feels like you’re inching towards your goal, but in most cases you’re simply delaying.

1371449825682685952 2021-03-15 13:14:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hrishio @weekendclubHQ @charlierward Interesting. I'm going to check this out. Thanks for sharing!
1371449692899454977 2021-03-15 13:14:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman Gonna check this out later today. Appreciate you sharing, Tom.
1371449582962540551 2021-03-15 13:13:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomosman As free software allows similar interaction to big names (Clubhouse, Spaces) it's going to be harder to make a community actually stand out. It's going to require direct 1:1 or 1:few interaction that justifies a cost.  Still, I don't have the answer, just the observation today.
1371449179902468098 2021-03-15 13:12:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency I'm not actually sure, to be honest. I was talking about it with my wife last night...It feels like smaller micro-groups at higher price points (it's not scalable at low price), with more interaction is potentially the future?  I could be wrong though.
1371447841311223811 2021-03-15 13:07:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Many communities don't actually feel like communities.  More like being a ticket holder at an event with a popular speaker &amp; limited member interaction.  Quick speech. Photo afterward.  Very impersonal.  At peak saturation, addressing this will be critical in retention, IMO.
1371445198065172480 2021-03-15 12:56:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ReeseClarett13 Happy body, happy mind.

1371114413508456449 2021-03-14 15:02:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson It's from the book "Hell Yeah or No" by @sivers. I bought it a few months back and finally opened it today. I've been enjoying it all morning. Exceptional read.
1371111876835348490 2021-03-14 14:52:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat It's an interesting way to think. I often tell my story of being a tech executive. But, I haven't been one in almost 2 years. I'm OK with that. Making it the past allows me to be someone different in my future (and my present).
1371104732018786306 2021-03-14 14:23:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Relinquish your past to better embrace your future.  https://t.co/RUgpP4ljw4
1371074563170312194 2021-03-14 12:23:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @szlaszlo5 @gumroad This is amazing. 🔥 I absolutely love it. Thanks, Szilvia!
1370863886937776133 2021-03-13 22:26:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GuruAnaerobic @dvassallo It was from a 2nd product launch.
1370863824526569482 2021-03-13 22:26:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MrJayCroft @gumroad Nope. This is one year.
1370818223726280714 2021-03-13 19:25:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @AnkitP_tweets It's a great question, but I don't feel the need to make a product thousands of dollars to insinuate quality. Mostly because I've purchased so many high-quality/low-cost courses already.
1370817812864831488 2021-03-13 19:23:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SoruKhandelia @gumroad  https://t.co/DzX2ZVTWiV
1370817776781262851 2021-03-13 19:23:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SoruKhandelia @gumroad One playbook on LinkedIn growth, the other on standing up a side hustle.
1370817244867989508 2021-03-13 19:21:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshcolter @dvassallo Thanks, Josh. Appreciate that. Was my goal, for sure.
1370789839872856076 2021-03-13 17:32:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @impostorphyllis @gumroad Yep!
1370789758708953091 2021-03-13 17:32:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo The sweet spot for me has been $40 to  $70. I’m much more likely to sell 3, $40 products than 1, $120 product.   Plus, if you deliver tremendous value at that price, you get the benefit of greater WOM.
1370784429061312516 2021-03-13 17:10:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dr Just scooped for a year. Nice product. 🔥
1370782866263699459 2021-03-13 17:04:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @impostorphyllis @gumroad One major launch of a new course.
1370782778351091712 2021-03-13 17:04:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AliQOfficial @gumroad Glad to hear it, Ali. I appreciate that kind compliment. Thanks for your support.
1370770347709054979 2021-03-13 16:14:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rohangilkes Same. Everyone’s journey is different anyways. Good stuff man.
1370768607215501314 2021-03-13 16:07:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rohangilkes Everyone is looking for a cheat code and it's literally just getting started.   One more blog read doesn't hold the secret key.
1370764081867657219 2021-03-13 15:49:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kensavage @gumroad HUGE
1370762135328985093 2021-03-13 15:42:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kensavage @gumroad I did one at a time. Was easier to manage for me.
1370761867749122049 2021-03-13 15:41:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiswenzel @gumroad Thanks, Wenzel. 🤛🏻
1370761741366333447 2021-03-13 15:40:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kensavage @gumroad When I launched I had spent maybe 8 months building an audience on LinkedIn. Now it’s been 2.5 years. Still my best channel by far. About 80k followers.
1370754782286188544 2021-03-13 15:13:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SpeedCapitalX @gumroad What are they about?
1370754332551954437 2021-03-13 15:11:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hustlenconquer @gumroad Isn’t it? Keep it going.
1370752635301662720 2021-03-13 15:04:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tomsauer @gumroad Thank you, Tom!
1370752599666868224 2021-03-13 15:04:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stefanmanku @gumroad One big launch, and one major promotion. Outside of that, I was pretty passive for the most part.
1370752258208493571 2021-03-13 15:03:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 365 days ago, I nervously clicked "start selling" on the @Gumroad homepage.  Been a wild ride.  https://t.co/pAOqcL5o2A
1370732738932793344 2021-03-13 13:45:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @growthcurrency @brandonthezhang @itsKostasOnFIRE @dickiebush @stephsmithio @leaderofone_ @AdamShoup @anthilemoon Many thanks, my man. Just discovered @stephsmithio and grabbed her eBook immediately.
1370562806731436033 2021-03-13 02:30:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Sorry to hear this man. Sending wonderful and positive thoughts your way.
1370562533598318594 2021-03-13 02:29:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mateomelgarg I do. I've got a free section on my website and a paid course that goes really in-depth.   The free advice article is on my Twitter profile and you can find a link to the course in that article.
1370533192772509698 2021-03-13 00:32:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tyler_lindley We're all falling behind in our own minds. In reality, if you're reading this, you're likely light years ahead.
1370491851942268935 2021-03-12 21:48:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adambrandizzi Do it. 🔥
1370491040491307008 2021-03-12 21:45:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dr This product looks great. 🔥  @heyblake you loving it?
1370485124232536064 2021-03-12 21:21:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattlady Looking fwd to seeing it, Matt.
1370485042393268227 2021-03-12 21:21:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MishaCreatrix Awesome. Try this next time and keep going for it, Michelle.
1370484957580247046 2021-03-12 21:20:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisdcloud Presell it on a simple landing page. If nobody buys, not worth building. The 45-minute course can be simple modules:  5 X 9 min. 6 X 8 min. 9 X 5 min.  Whatever works for you to get students to that one outcome.
1370484028139212800 2021-03-12 21:17:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Launching your 1st digital course 101:  - Topic you could talk about unprepared - Presell via landing page first - Focused on one outcome - Timebox 14 to 30 days - Keep it short (~45 min.) - Beta group + feedback - Ask for testimonials - Upsell coaching  Start one this weekend.
1370112545533616128 2021-03-11 20:41:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Being broke doesn't make you "indie". Being wealthy doesn't make you a "sellout".  These are labels people apply to feel better.  Work to put yourself in the best situation for you, not to earn the best label from others.
1370094278886690822 2021-03-11 19:28:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyblake  https://t.co/pM7PYIVMKZ
1370082132199145476 2021-03-11 18:40:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Cokedupoptions Need to add a "no template" for this one...
1370067996501233667 2021-03-11 17:43:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @optimized3x I just have one simple template. I'll DM it to you.
1370067908458610689 2021-03-11 17:43:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @castagno_tm 🙏
1370067844130611201 2021-03-11 17:43:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jadesai94 Best to figure out than to always assume it won't...
1370067748718534659 2021-03-11 17:43:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vantellus It's amazing how many people get power from doubt. From the assuredness that what you're looking to do simply cannot work.
1370062465027993600 2021-03-11 17:22:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In business, be wary of people who say:  "That will never work...", but are unwilling to try.  ✅ Doubt is fine. ✅ Debate is fine. ✅ Concern is fine.  Being unwilling to hypothesize, test and iterate is not.
1370055286975791108 2021-03-11 16:53:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GregoryCronie I'll DM you.
1370047616826941440 2021-03-11 16:23:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Amitabh1010 I'll DM you my template.
1370016158242516997 2021-03-11 14:18:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VijarKohli Extremely effective IMO.
1370016113703157768 2021-03-11 14:17:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MightyFineCopy_ I found my favorite template that works for so many situations and just keep it open on my desktop at all times. Happy to share if helpful.
1370015229933944845 2021-03-11 14:14:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I have "how to say no" stickies open on my desktop at all times.  Highly recommend this for improved time protection.
1370010835695853573 2021-03-11 13:56:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MightyFineCopy_ Santa Maria del Tule? Went there a few months back. Amazing.

1369762324328947733 2021-03-10 21:29:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshua_hornby Thanks, my man. Much appreciated.
1369745378942279681 2021-03-10 20:22:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build while everyone else is distracted.
1369695555866222604 2021-03-10 17:04:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Observation:  Most people who can't handle being challenged are the same people who don't believe in themselves.  Thin skin is a confidence issue.
1369650248726044672 2021-03-10 14:04:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's tough to build a reputation if you only share thoughts from others.  Write, record, or build underneath your own name.  Reap the rewards of personal accountability.
1369622720397402115 2021-03-10 12:14:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @orl_and @hypefury @wiseconnector @LifeMathMoney @Yannick_Veys Thanks, Andrea. I'm glad you enjoyed the episode, man. Thanks for giving it a listen. Cheers.
1369463836521230336 2021-03-10 01:43:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ I think it’s for any stage startup that wants more cash upfront without dilution. But I might be messing this all up. @harryhurst - am I screwing this up?
1369462548379168774 2021-03-10 01:38:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SalesRebellion 😂 I’ll take the roasting. A hilarious account.
1369461738526150664 2021-03-10 01:34:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ I believe They turn recurring monthly revenue for SaaS companies into upfront payments by taking on the monthly sub and fronting the cash.
1369452429155139593 2021-03-10 00:57:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryangum Damn, Ryan. Rarely does a piece of content nail it the way this one does.   Captured it perfectly. I’m trying to make “better” money, not more money.   Tools will come from this realization.
1369436576858652674 2021-03-09 23:54:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tviktalks Yep. I write about 240 new pieces per year and repurpose about 20 per year when I’m not feeling creative.
1369436093687472130 2021-03-09 23:53:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamierusso @dickiebush Damn these are cool 👏🏻 I talk about building and creating. Any help?
1369413958273277955 2021-03-09 22:25:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vantellus @Cokedupoptions I have two back surgeries, so I can't move it even if I wanted to. (I did not want to - I hate manual labor)  Paid too much is also very subjective. $130 to avoid doing this task is a steal, IMO.
1369410664255610885 2021-03-09 22:11:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markymetry 😂 Shit, I'll take it. All pub is good pub.
1369392950023716867 2021-03-09 21:01:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Cokedupoptions It's moving fast and on a real incline.  https://t.co/hcxIXRyMIf
1369388588316639239 2021-03-09 20:44:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Cokedupoptions Many thanks, John. Big fan 👏

1369387268499255302 2021-03-09 20:39:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People confuse income &amp; wealth.  Income is what your paychecks say.   Wealth is your situation if that paycheck stopped.
1369387108465602560 2021-03-09 20:38:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Cokedupoptions @SullyBusiness I'll take the free publicity. Thanks, John!
1369385577469145094 2021-03-09 20:32:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MishaCreatrix @growthcurrency Thanks, Dylan. Very much appreciated...
1369325457057976331 2021-03-09 16:33:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hypefury Was great being on @Yannick_Veys appreciate you having me.
1369324352232189953 2021-03-09 16:29:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The first thing I do when I get paid?   I ask myself: "How can I buy back more of my time?"  The answer is usually automation or delegation.
1369295898308706313 2021-03-09 14:35:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Watching this growth is so fantastic Andrew. Congratulations. Keep going.
1369295781602156550 2021-03-09 14:35:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanam26 As long as you’re chipping away. I just can’t stay up that late 🥱

1369289401252118530 2021-03-09 14:10:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau Make that slow, beautiful shift away from the traditional path...
1369289120061796353 2021-03-09 14:09:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Spend 5 to 9 escaping your 9 to 5.

1369268837623988235 2021-03-09 12:48:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @usefathom @AZinkevich Nice work, Andrei. I'm excited to see how quickly you took action. Fathom is amazing. Simple yet robust, and private. Enjoy.
1369090372673155077 2021-03-09 00:59:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyblake You're nailing this, Blake.   Also, collaborate and grow together 🚀
1369068181785108483 2021-03-08 23:31:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamierusso Love it. Many thanks, Jamie.
1369066039586283521 2021-03-08 23:22:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamierusso I would love one if I’m not too late. These are amazing.
1369058005245890562 2021-03-08 22:50:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool Consistency + value + community + patience (and plenty of other things)...  Are there learnings that you can help folks realize sooner? Sure.  But you simply cannot "hack" a long-term brand.
1369044980787015682 2021-03-08 21:58:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cnyryan By delegating, you're freeing up time long-term. Fiverr and Upwork allow nearly any creator to outsource at an extremely reasonable price.
1369039096962834432 2021-03-08 21:35:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jesssaha @robertsitalia For me it’s brainstorming new products and services, writing, creating content, etc.
1369030371329912839 2021-03-08 21:00:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @robertsitalia Putting together presentations, fonts, logos, colors, landing pages, copywriting, etc.
1369030233882509319 2021-03-08 21:00:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SeanAnthonySays 100%. I'm 2.5 years in and still struggle to delegate and outsource effectively.
1369024173872447492 2021-03-08 20:36:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jordisquare Yep, but it's critical to do that promotion to make some income. Can always outsource that too, I guess.
1368959958696493060 2021-03-08 16:21:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Start this week off by remembering the people you admire are deeply flawed too.  https://t.co/HnW1uCe3n9

1368932438643212289 2021-03-08 14:31:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @VizBiz15 Also true. For me, I need free time to be creative to conquer those constraints.
1368925979578494981 2021-03-08 14:06:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Creativity comes with a very open calendar.
1368693719713603584 2021-03-07 22:43:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JODonnellCoach @ericjmlee Gave him a follow. Thanks.
1368637768654585859 2021-03-07 19:00:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @danmartell Crazy good. 🔥
1368627097716015108 2021-03-07 18:18:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ I’m at lunch, excited FOR you. Amazing. 🔥
1368626804068614146 2021-03-07 18:17:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Life lesson.   Shoot that shot. Wow.
1368615441497722881 2021-03-07 17:32:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @orl_and My content at the beginning was awful. I just didn't know it.  I'm still working to become a better writer every day.  To me, it's consistent practice and patience.
1368610157664559104 2021-03-07 17:11:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamuelCise Many thanks, Samuel. I've got a bunch of articles on there focused on growth. I hope they are helpful. Cheers.
1368608045891207173 2021-03-07 17:02:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shelisademuth The great thing about writing is that it's hard to actually see yourself getting better in real-time.  It's only when you look back 1-2 years and review prior work that you see the huge shift.
1368606522364882948 2021-03-07 16:56:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @freeagentglobal Grow or atrophy.
1368605109500796928 2021-03-07 16:51:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've written every day for 2.5+ years now.  - Sometimes people love it. - Sometimes people hate it. - Sometimes people ignore it.  You know what?  Doesn't matter.  Getting thoughts out = growing
1368600800482754563 2021-03-07 16:33:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamuelCise Here's a screenshot of the promotion I did on LinkedIn + I have a newsletter that mentioned it (4.1k subs)   https://t.co/w5Zcr17qEo
1368600506998915073 2021-03-07 16:32:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vantellus @quinnemmett Yep. I'm probably much closer to 90/10 or 95/5 if I'm being honest. But, really 80/20 is what I should shoot for.
1368557759113920513 2021-03-07 13:42:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @quinnemmett Ha. Damn. Funny how that works, Quinn.   Use a customer testimonial and a few coupons. Generally works well for me. Here’s my last sales post (LinkedIn).  https://t.co/h6bWByicVC
1368555582219825152 2021-03-07 13:34:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @quinnemmett Same. When I’m in the zone, I promote once a week. 80/20 give/ask.   When I go any extended period of time without doing it, I get a bit more uncomfortable.   Consistency, as always, wins.
1368551005441454081 2021-03-07 13:16:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In the last 30 days, I've promoted my digital products once online.  Here are the results:  ❌ 29 days of no promotion: $3,886 ✅ 1 day of promotion: $5,817  43x difference per day.  Sales don't just happen. If you're going to sell, get comfortable with self-promotion.
1368355379353169922 2021-03-07 00:18:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher One of your truest yet. 🔥
1367985644069396482 2021-03-05 23:49:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @5harath Awesome work, my man 👊🏻
1367936663222181895 2021-03-05 20:34:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you enjoyed this, feel free to swing by my website, where I write advice for 4,100+ entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, and creators in my weekly newsletter.   https://t.co/Qry377jQGO
1367936662408413185 2021-03-05 20:34:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Remember...you don't need permission from anyone to teach and share.   Someone out there is behind you on a similar journey.   They’re just waiting for you to show up and guide them.  Go out and start sharing your journey today.  Have a great weekend.
1367936661527597060 2021-03-05 20:34:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. How am I useful to others?  2. What do people want from me or my journey?  3. What do friends and family come to me for advice about?  4. Who is a few steps behind me that could benefit from my experience?
1367936660655210502 2021-03-05 20:34:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You are further along on some journey than other people.   It could be in your career, in a certain skill, or even a hobby.  So, the best way to think about sharing, teaching, and expertise is not, "Am I an expert?" or "Am I a teacher?" but rather...
1367936659837353991 2021-03-05 20:34:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This is a blueprint for teaching.  99% of the people that you admire online or offline are still figuring it out.   They are simply further along on their journey than you are and sharing what they’ve learned so far.  The good news?
1367936658943926278 2021-03-05 20:34:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In the movie Catch Me If You Can, Frank Abagnale is apprehended by the FBI after posing as a Sociology teacher at BYU.  When they asked him, “How in the world did you teach that class?", his answer was telling:  “All I had to do was read one chapter ahead of the students.”
1367936658109304834 2021-03-05 20:34:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. At what point does someone become an "expert"?  Most "thought leaders" that you follow online are simply more experienced in a particular subject than you are.  They don't have a degree or certificate. They just went for it.  And now they are ahead. There's a pattern here.
1367936657308217349 2021-03-05 20:34:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Who “deserves” to teach something?  For example, most school teachers are not “world-renowned experts”.   They merely know more about math, writing, and geography than their students.
1367936656494444547 2021-03-05 20:34:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> To begin, people get too caught up in what it means to be an "expert".  This blinds you to the very real and very valuable knowledge you do have, that would be beneficial to others.  Here are two questions worth considering:
1367936655785615363 2021-03-05 20:34:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Creating online is hard.  Many people believe they have nothing valuable worth sharing.  I call this "knowledge blindness"  A short thread on why you're wrong 👇🏻 👇🏻

1367881859422633985 2021-03-05 16:57:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyblake One piece of the secret sauce here (and really anywhere) appears to be simply engaging intelligently.  Value-adding commentary stands out in a sea of emojis and "yep's".   It's like gasoline on the fire.
1367880655615492100 2021-03-05 16:52:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You control your own destiny.  I've been trying to sum that up for people who want to change their life situation.  While trying to find the right words, I came across this Tweet from @TheCoolestCool and I stopped.  This is all you need to read.  https://t.co/XFnp3DXuHk

1367243099328585730 2021-03-03 22:38:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joywithjas @sergiodn_ Appreciate the push, Jason. Always been a writer.  Next stop, video.

1367240819296653313 2021-03-03 22:29:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Following popular accounts is great, but their quantity prompts FOMO for me.  Following accounts on your growth trajectory can feel more empowering.   Like you're growing together, not playing catch up.  Who are the best under 10k follows in the creator space?
1367197601121107978 2021-03-03 19:38:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyork20 Haha. Noted.
1367191145227444224 2021-03-03 19:12:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandondigital I just forgot to ask in the last 3 months. Finally did today.
1367191056664715269 2021-03-03 19:12:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau LIP. I haven't promoted it in a long time. I did today.   Voila.

1366940112425254914 2021-03-03 02:34:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kim_Currier_ Me too.
1366937124193320962 2021-03-03 02:23:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bronxtrader Mostly just talking to myself.
1366937058292465667 2021-03-03 02:22:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cnyryan Yep. But most people just reading about delegation. Have to actually do it.
1366936215694540801 2021-03-03 02:19:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Crypto_Keith I may be attacking myself.
1366934492678602755 2021-03-03 02:12:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bookswallah As long as implementation comes. Reading as procrastination is an action killer.
1366932893122101250 2021-03-03 02:06:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you keep reading instead of doing, you’re just a procrastinator.  Book down.  Action up.

1366542579320422401 2021-03-02 00:15:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jbplat Products are becoming commoditized.   Instead, differentiate by understanding their desired state.

1366516989150248965 2021-03-01 22:33:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @5harath @jackbutcher I'm glad you found the call helpful, Sharath. Rooting you on as you launch Shoutout.  I think Jack has quite a few legs up on me, but I'll graciously take the kind compliment.   Cheers.

1366481741456826380 2021-03-01 20:13:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffbajorek Glad to hear it, Jeff. Thanks for taking the time to read it.
1366480790515761164 2021-03-01 20:09:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rynfrz I'm always floored by how much time people waste on Twitter dumping on other social media channels.   Curate a good LinkedIn network and it's a great channel for growth.
1366479189453516806 2021-03-01 20:03:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> LinkedIn has massive organic reach right now.  My wife and I have done 4.6M impressions in 2 months.  I just brain-dumped everything I know about it onto a "free advice" page on my website.  Hope it's helpful. Cheers.   https://t.co/vwY3rEs2im  https://t.co/f3QxbgXNy6
1366453780137598977 2021-03-01 18:22:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DuaneDufault Definitely. That's why I chose the word "often". I certainly wouldn't state that it automatically makes you stagnant.
1366438969962070018 2021-03-01 17:23:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmandaMGoetz Congratulations, Amanda. The Welsh family is rooting for your growth from here in Nashville as users of your products.   Best of luck with the product move. 🙌
1366428438387691523 2021-03-01 16:41:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theangrygoth @JuiceboxCA That's OK to not be bothered by them. I just happen to be.  I noticed it the night before when cooking w/ my wife. We each had to keep scrolling, closing ads, trying to find our place.  In the end (to me) it's ab simply asking "Is there a better way?" I believe there has to be.
1366425528744501254 2021-03-01 16:30:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theangrygoth @JuiceboxCA As someone who cooks at home often using these recipe sites, I can tell you it's a major annoyance.  I understand the intention behind what he created. I also understand why people are upset.   In the end, there has to be a better way than to have 75% of my screen covered w/ ads.
1366424835165999107 2021-03-01 16:27:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshua_hornby @lukecannon727 Congrats, Josh. You're not "underqualified". Just aim to help folks that haven't figured out as much as you have.  Happy to sign up and provide a bit of feedback as well if helpful.
1366388919936417798 2021-03-01 14:04:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Self-employment vs. a 9 to 5  The variable income of self-employment keeps you innovative but on your toes.  A salary often keeps you comfortable but stagnant.  Neither is wrong, just different in shaping daily actions.  It's good to learn this before you strike out on your own.
1366387608121716736 2021-03-01 13:59:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @linkedin_king Ha. Thanks :)
1366220868960018433 2021-03-01 02:56:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MoChanmugham Thanks, Mo. I'm pumped to create with a full day. Appreciate your support.  I've seen these Hop Black Teas - gonna give 'em a try. Cheers.
1366204685946863620 2021-03-01 01:52:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @erlangsec It really is a productivity killer. I've produced so much good work in the last 7 days, it's incredible.
1366199848102420480 2021-03-01 01:33:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanyep It's been the most meaningful change I've made. It's crazy how fast the impact shows itself.

1366185683803660290 2021-03-01 00:37:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1. Sleep 2. Mornings 3. Productivity 4. Mental health 5. Physical health 6. Your eating choices 7. Your financial situation 8. Your romantic relationship(s)  Have a great night and a wonderful week.  🍵
1366185635032276993 2021-03-01 00:36:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Honestly, craft beer &amp; wine have been a big part of my identity.  Learning to live without them isn't easy at all, but the days and nights are SO much better.  If you're thinking about cutting alcohol from your life, give it a go.  Try one week and check these 8 life categories👇🏻
1366185571769548801 2021-03-01 00:36:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My relationship with my wife is better.  We've always had a great relationship, but even a few drinks and we're both much more irritable and impatient.  Now, we have sparkling water and hot tea at night and are much more kind to one another.  It's like we're dating again.  👩‍❤️‍👨
1366185335869349888 2021-03-01 00:35:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My relationship with my wife is better.  We've always had a great relationship, but even a few drinks and we're both much more irritable and impatient.  Now, we have sparkling water and hot tea at night and are much more kind to one another.  It's like we're dating again.  👩‍❤️‍👨
1366185293544587267 2021-03-01 00:35:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My bank account looks fuller!  Alcohol is expensive. We used to have a bottle of wine at night and it would cost $20 or so.  Going out for a few glasses with tax and tip? Exorbitant.  I estimate we'll save $800 - $1,000 per month with no beer, wine, or cocktails.  💰
1366185200208773124 2021-03-01 00:35:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My eating choices are remarkably better.  One beer and I throw all care to the wind. It's time for hamburgers or BBQ or french fries.  Now, we're ordering salads, making fresh seafood and vegetables, and cooking 2x more than we used to.  Huge health benefits all around.  🏃🏻
1366184911108005891 2021-03-01 00:33:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That drink "bloat" goes away pretty fast.  I've lost 3 lbs and it's most noticeable in the areas where people bloat.  - Stomach - Face - Neck  An improvement in physical health and appearance goes a long way in better confidence and attitude.  🏋🏻
1366184910227128325 2021-03-01 00:33:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Anxiety is down significantly.  I underestimated the impact that a few drinks have on my brain.  I used to feel FOMO, anxiety, urgency, etc. when I had drinks. Alcohol is the world's strongest depressant.  Now?  Nearly eliminated. I'm more patient, level-headed, and focused.  🙂
1366184909405122563 2021-03-01 00:33:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Productivity improvements? Massive.  During COVID, a drink at 530 was normal. Once I had one, I wasn't going to do anything after. The day was over.  Now, I can use this time, or morning time (no cloudiness) to get things accomplished.   I estimate 4+ available hours gained.  👨🏻‍💼
1366184908541071362 2021-03-01 00:33:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Mornings are positive vs. negative  I used to wake up a bit groggy and feeling out of shape because of 225+ calories craft IPAs.  The first thought of the day was negative.  Now? Spring out of bed feeling light and excited for the day.  ☀️
1366184907723145221 2021-03-01 00:33:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My sleep has drastically improved.  I was sleeping ~6 to 6.5 hours per night when I was having alcohol in the evening.  Getting up 2x-3x to get a glass of water or the restroom.  Now, I'm logging a solid 8 hours every night with minimal interruptions.  Huge win.  💤
1366184906968162304 2021-03-01 00:33:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One week ago, I eliminated alcohol from my life.  Here's everything that has happened to me in this very short period of time and what I've learned from it.  👇🏻👇🏻
1366112985979224069 2021-02-28 19:48:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @THETYFRANKEL @SaaSWiz @SaaSCapo @VisionAndSales @ImSamThompson Go inbound marketing on lower ACV deals and use Outbound to climb upmarket. Keep unit churn low with sticky integrations and have value-add upsells to keep $$ churn negative.   All easy to say. All difficult to do of course.
1366009899369582592 2021-02-28 12:58:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @im_usamakhalid @kevon69 @davegerhardt Much appreciated, Usama. Cheers.
1365830272265187330 2021-02-28 01:04:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @5harath 🤜🏻 great. Reach out if you need any help. Cheers.
1365821748244066305 2021-02-28 00:30:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @5harath Most people use features and benefits. I always taught my teams to use "negative present" and "positive future".   How do you take people from where they are today (something missing // negative) and transform them to where they want to be (positive)?   Paint that picture.
1365809320290566145 2021-02-27 23:41:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abrowning100 Generally themselves, IMO. They don’t believe they have value to offer so they don’t. They don’t give themselves permission.
1365809171166359553 2021-02-27 23:40:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @garrett_forbes From themselves. To feel like they are “qualified”.
1365797585429147654 2021-02-27 22:54:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JuiceboxCA  https://t.co/Soy1bR8k2P
1365796752993959937 2021-02-27 22:51:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JuiceboxCA Recently started. Lots of fun, a ton of good feedback.   Fingers crossed we don’t get obnoxious. (No promises)  If you were being sarcastic then I’m obviously lying.
1365793475267092483 2021-02-27 22:38:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson That’s interesting. A huge part of the fun was figuring it out on your own.
1365786275165462534 2021-02-27 22:09:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Recent observation...  People think they need step-by-step instructions. They don't. They need:  - Motivation - Permission - Confidence  Here it is in one statement:  Every person I know that's "successful" is still figuring it out.
1365786264230895618 2021-02-27 22:09:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @impostorphyllis Awesome, Phyllis. Excited to watch you grow. Get after it. Cheers.
1365712060982710311 2021-02-27 17:15:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianSexton13 @thepatwalls I'll DM you it.
1365708058932969472 2021-02-27 16:59:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW I’m not becoming a better writer.   (Reviews writing from 18 months ago)  Oh...
1365707349604892672 2021-02-27 16:56:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LorynMaul @thepatwalls It's just a gallery of templates on saying no. SUPER helpful if you're not good at it (like I'm not).
1365707247079292935 2021-02-27 16:55:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW It's interesting how when we start rambling, we don't see the progress as it happens.  When you zoom out? It becomes very evident.
1365704605401817089 2021-02-27 16:45:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Saying "no" is a gift to yourself.  Unfortunately, it's hard.  Fortunately, there's a great site by @thepatwalls called "How To Say No".  I used it to put together a template that has helped 20x in the last month.   https://t.co/nfndtZqC6N  Just drop a note below if you want mine.
1365408322942345218 2021-02-26 21:08:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hi_rankin Happy to point you to some great people, Helen. PatientPop was a 150+ person team that ran like a machine but sounded very personal. Can hook you up with some of the folks that built it at the rep/cadence level.
1365357181713973250 2021-02-26 17:44:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cmkrohn93 @Dmurr68 Thanks, Cole. Much appreciated.
1365092479947702273 2021-02-26 00:13:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @impostorphyllis Thanks, Phyllis. Appreciate that.
1365089695961645060 2021-02-26 00:02:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The average seeks out best practices.  The incredible creates them.
1365015605921918978 2021-02-25 19:07:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley This is basically me on Zoom:  https://t.co/MzT4UCSF2K
1364705604657418248 2021-02-24 22:35:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmj Getting my revenue team to $50M in ARR from $0, and then stepping down, burned out.
1364614257330028544 2021-02-24 16:32:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GerardDawson3 That's so cool.  I'm going to check this out, Gerard. Appreciate you sharing.
1364614134998925317 2021-02-24 16:32:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MatthewPetre I'm glad it resonated at the perfect time, Matthew. Cheers.
1364614018095337476 2021-02-24 16:31:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregsroche Exact same experience here. I generally overprepare, only to find out my clients are impressed by the basics.
1364613913371963392 2021-02-24 16:31:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caseywinans Same here. I thought, "Doesn't everyone know this?"   The answer? No.
1364586526563303425 2021-02-24 14:42:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyblake @jasonvana Thanks, my man. Excited for your show. Thanks for having me on.
1364582165850296323 2021-02-24 14:25:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewlogemann Thanks, Andrew.   It's incredible how many people are hell-bent on becoming their own version of an "expert" before they ever share anything useful.  Too much good knowledge locked inside people's brains.
1364581191307919363 2021-02-24 14:21:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Many people believe they don't have valuable knowledge to share.  I wrote about that today 👇🏻   https://t.co/HnH4STuNLp
1364254107104641029 2021-02-23 16:41:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Smart! 🔥
1364253678648057858 2021-02-23 16:39:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BriancTomlinson Exactly. It's not worth doing it another way.
1364253609077145603 2021-02-23 16:39:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat It's a huge lesson and often a tough one to remember. When you break it down (as you have) it's so crystal clear.
1364253477917057026 2021-02-23 16:39:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeKedrec Yep - just be yourself and let those who appreciate you gather over time.
1364248453073756164 2021-02-23 16:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You cannot please everyone.  No matter how hard you try, it's impossible.   Instead, do things that please yourself, and let the network grow around you.  Being "self-centered" isn't always a bad thing.
1364014972783755270 2021-02-23 00:51:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJonFedor @mkobach Keep it going, Jon!
1363984055176462339 2021-02-22 22:48:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 @jasonfried I can appreciate all of that. I think it helps to have context around preferred outcomes.   Some people write for a living, to earn income.  Others want to publish their thoughts into the ether for the sake of creating. This solves a problem for the latter, maybe not the former?
1363963901327650817 2021-02-22 21:28:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonfried "...it required yet another tool, yet another place to write, yet another platform to pay for just one feature. I had to pick a template, I had to think up a name..."  Feels like you are speaking directly to me.  I just want to write.  Love this idea.
1362422119276118017 2021-02-18 15:22:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Always appreciate you and your support, Ali. Many thanks for reading it.
1362417052141682688 2021-02-18 15:01:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattlady Thanks for spending your valuable time reading it Matt. Always appreciated.
1362412487530938372 2021-02-18 14:43:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gregsroche Appreciate that, Greg. It was quite therapeutic to write.
1362407245447892992 2021-02-18 14:22:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In 2019, I had a massive panic attack at 36.  It changed my outlook on life.   Ever since I've been obsessed with the idea of designing a more intentional life.  Two years later, here's everything I've learned...   https://t.co/TtQtzmSvrJ
1362211505945649156 2021-02-18 01:25:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MarkBToole So easy. So productive.
1362205516320104448 2021-02-18 01:01:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxmatt_ @THETYFRANKEL Nice, thanks!
1362202546362810368 2021-02-18 00:49:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @THETYFRANKEL Simple plug-in: Hide Twitter Trends   Work is now easier than ever.
1362202025715519492 2021-02-18 00:47:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> No Twitter trends?  No distractions.  https://t.co/C29zpsikUr
1362185526732800000 2021-02-17 23:41:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmikolay This sounds like a no-brainer. Just submitted my application. Thanks for putting this together, Justin. Cheers.
1362137733842493446 2021-02-17 20:31:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tweetsbyejordan @FitFounder Thanks, Jordan! Appreciate it man. Cheers.
1362075880135266305 2021-02-17 16:26:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @RyanJCormier Many thanks, Ryan. Glad you enjoyed it. Hope it's helpful in your growth journey!
1362064219127099398 2021-02-17 15:39:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vyasdhanraj @ChrisWalker171 Thanks, man. Glad you enjoyed it.
1362061048417816580 2021-02-17 15:27:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bausbrooks_ Some people know more, others less. But nobody knew it at the beginning.
1362060564198006784 2021-02-17 15:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A quick reminder that many of your heroes are still winging it.   Do something uncomfortable today.  Assess. Iterate. Try again.
1361812259484413953 2021-02-16 22:58:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshua_hornby I think it's mostly the opening line. The scroll stopper.   I'm not sure, to be honest. I don't really think about it much more than 1 week out.  I have noticed an algorithmic change recently. As usual, I'll just keep getting on base each day, which is what I always recommend.
1361805436274561038 2021-02-16 22:31:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshua_hornby Some have gone extremely well, while others not so much. For me, it's easier to create short, punchy posts so from an effort:impact ratio, I'm liking it.
1361791497381834753 2021-02-16 21:36:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pwprommel Love that. It's not about following your passion. It's about finding time for it.
1361783068374237185 2021-02-16 21:02:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @domm  https://t.co/TEugunduZY
1361777119773265920 2021-02-16 20:39:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's tough to own your life when you rent out all of your time.
1361758530726993925 2021-02-16 19:25:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @albertocvindie I posted each day to LinkedIn talking about very specific topics. After awhile people started to reach out and ask for time. I charged. Learned. Increased rates.   Other folks do it through Twitter. Some do it through long form. That was just my journey.
1361736654931779584 2021-02-16 17:58:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @albertocvindie Set up simple calls where you charge for a little time. Start tracking commonalities - what are the most common things people need/ask for?  Build those into lightweight digital products.  Raise your rates. Repeat.
1361728452408315905 2021-02-16 17:25:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Thanks again, Josh. Fun to see your impact.
1361719220942340102 2021-02-16 16:48:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AZinkevich @jspector This @usefathom - I use it for my personal website tracking.
1361711260300148743 2021-02-16 16:17:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @jspector Really smart advice. Appreciate it, Brian.
1361702468871221254 2021-02-16 15:42:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @connorcirillo @jspector Short-form comes more naturally to me, so I'm starting to branch out towards longer-form.   I do that by identifying pieces of content that resonated &amp; expanding on them.   For others, they might be gifted writers but lack that short punch. It's a comfort thing, IMO.
1361699199365115908 2021-02-16 15:29:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @jspector I'm currently the reverse, but working that muscle as hard as I can. Currently editing my longest piece yet. Quite nervous to even release it.
1361697560847597568 2021-02-16 15:22:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I prefer writing short-form content.  But I often forget the power of long-form to be distributed more widely.  Thanks to people like @jspector who shared &amp; 7x'ed my daily traffic with his dedicated, close-knit following.  If long-form isn't part of your arsenal, I'd consider it.  https://t.co/FWfizjXjLQ
1361344673126748163 2021-02-15 16:00:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @marktzk @jspector Appreciate the kind share, Mark.
1361335170310287366 2021-02-15 15:22:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisHeidorn I can appreciate that. I made a conscious decision to price myself only on value/outcomes and let those who want cheaper hourly/project help look elsewhere.   It can be scary, but in the end, my client base and I are 100% aligned.
1361322310079295493 2021-02-15 14:31:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lcrothlisberger I always sell outcomes. Never time.
1361321761703419906 2021-02-15 14:29:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Normalize charging for outcomes.
1361155680271560707 2021-02-15 03:29:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abyshake @dvassallo It’s definitely a fine line. As I wrote in my response, had I flinched I might have been living a totally different, less intentional life right now.
1361129192054812672 2021-02-15 01:44:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo So true. I did it at 37. I think if I had flinched...it may never have been.
1361128606655733760 2021-02-15 01:42:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo It’s worth considering that the 2nd path, if navigated quickly, can be extremely good fuel to live the 1st for a long part of your life.
1361000091734147087 2021-02-14 17:11:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pragyami @Dmurr68 Many thanks 🤜🏻
1360996535304146948 2021-02-14 16:57:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher @thefrenchmaker Hi Thibault - built a few big revenue streams off of it. It’s a good spend of time IMO, plus a bit easier to figure out than Twitter. I enjoy the interaction there, especially if you curate a good network. Can be noisy if you don’t.
1360796370618179584 2021-02-14 03:41:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector @david_perell @craigclemens Thanks for the nice mention, Josh. Much appreciated. Cheers.
1360258886926626817 2021-02-12 16:06:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everything you think is obvious is worth money to someone else.
1360225521653731329 2021-02-12 13:53:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeff_goldenberg Aggressive.
1360032670793814019 2021-02-12 01:07:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo ❤️. Btw, me and @Its_Jenn_Here are huge @house__of__wise fans. Just loving it.
1359983869202735112 2021-02-11 21:53:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Yannick_Veys Name your own tuition. What a concept, huh?
1359981290871734272 2021-02-11 21:43:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @zachweismann Sounds like maybe you need to be a bit more aggressive with the ol' block button.
1359977619878535170 2021-02-11 21:28:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Every single day.
1359977539146506240 2021-02-11 21:28:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nikornikhil_ Which makes your ability to make good decisions even more important. Democratized access to great and bad professors.  Make the right choice.
1359976835078045696 2021-02-11 21:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @m1guelpf And no debt...
1359976637614424065 2021-02-11 21:24:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 I'm just a TA.
1359976546887434246 2021-02-11 21:24:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Where people like class.
1359976459926974465 2021-02-11 21:23:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau Ain't it though? Can't believe this is free.
1359975658387091458 2021-02-11 21:20:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter is like college, but with better professors.
1359972487862374406 2021-02-11 21:08:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @gumroad @dvassallo Appreciate that, Edward. I'd invest in Daniel too.
1359880171604611076 2021-02-11 15:01:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaditsh Making very intentional choices greatly improves your ability to succeed. Social media, real life, job, etc.  Almost always applies.
1359878303084146688 2021-02-11 14:53:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Pessimistic people are poison.  The antidote is a better network.  Intentional network → intentional life.
1359868034559725570 2021-02-11 14:12:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @williamschukwu4 Thank you!
1359612947170025475 2021-02-10 21:19:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @domm Long live high velocity SaaS. 🔥
1359602213283323905 2021-02-10 20:36:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeKedrec Love that, Mike. Never thought about it that way. Middleman.
1359600320062640132 2021-02-10 20:29:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Stop expecting people to teach you.  Start teaching yourself.  Autonomy is a muscle worth building.

1359509017253601281 2021-02-10 14:26:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Sure thing, Ali. I'm hoping that it's delivering some value to people. Cheers, and thanks for reading.
1359500861181988872 2021-02-10 13:53:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wherebenmercer2 Sure thing, Ben. Thanks for taking the time to read it. Much appreciated.
1359496160772296704 2021-02-10 13:35:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HiRyanParker Appreciate you sharing, Ryan. Cheers.
1359491339528855552 2021-02-10 13:16:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JWellsCFO Thanks for reading, Jeremy. Cheers.
1359489808431742978 2021-02-10 13:10:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> P.S. Today, I tried something a little different.  I skipped pulling my LI audience through the blog and pulled them directly to this Tweet thread (👋 hi, again).  Later, I'll share if that was more/less successful by adding to this thread.   Cheers.
1359489807513251851 2021-02-10 13:10:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope you found this small tip helpful.  If so, I'd be honored to have you join my newsletter.  I write weekly about systems &amp; processes that I use to power my solopreneur journey:  https://t.co/vCOnWlle21
1359489806301069312 2021-02-10 13:10:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Since introducing a few weeks ago, I've been growing my email list 20x faster than I was before.  https://t.co/NqkLp2MmEf
1359489805537718275 2021-02-10 13:10:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Since Twitter is a secondary platform for me, most of the exposure I get is to people who haven't seen me before.  I'm leveraging the inward momentum my LI audience creates.  Then I turn that into outward momentum on Twitter to grow new emails and followers.  The result?
1359489803771924481 2021-02-10 13:10:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 4:   This compounding action creates "outward momentum" to a new audience here on Twitter.    That drives:  - New Twitter followers - New email subscribers  https://t.co/ciZec5FzG5
1359489790270398466 2021-02-10 13:09:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 3:   The CTA at the end of my blog asks my LinkedIn &amp; email audience to take action with a Like or RT of a thread on Twitter.   This does two things:  - Brings them to a new platform (Hi 👋)  - Creates compounding action in one place.   (like this thread, I hope)  https://t.co/Kxqfzv1WWg
1359489776806674432 2021-02-10 13:09:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 2:   I share the blog on LinkedIn + via my email list.  That pulls a large number of people from my pre-built audience into the blog.  I'm basically pulling 75k+ people.  This creates "inward momentum."  https://t.co/kBPcksXdUd
1359489773300252672 2021-02-10 13:09:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 1:   I start by creating a long-form piece of content on my blog.  This piece will act as the center of the entire momentum web.  But the blog itself does not acquire email subscribers simply by existing.  The next step will start our momentum machine.  https://t.co/ul9Z0L8NpX
1359489769856782336 2021-02-10 13:09:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So, in 2021, I’ve been focused on using 2 types of momentum + compound attention to acquire more of both.  I'll explain in 4 simple steps.
1359489769101791232 2021-02-10 13:09:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Fast forward to 2021, and I have 71k+ followers on LinkedIn.   And, I’ve been able to support 3 different businesses through it.  But, I still have a relatively small email list (~4.1k) and Twitter following (~3.6k).
1359489768267079681 2021-02-10 13:09:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Back in 2018, I had a hypothesis that getting some attention online would be helpful in my solopreneur journey.  When it came time to create, I picked LinkedIn.  Back then, Twitter was still a place where I got updates on the news and looked at random trends.
1359489767545724931 2021-02-10 13:09:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> After months of tinkering, my email list is growing 20x faster.  Two key factors:  - Momentum - Compound attention  If you have a following on any platform, this one could be helpful.  THREAD👇🏻👇🏻
1359310739996110849 2021-02-10 01:18:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DuaneDufault @caseywinans Deciding not to measure people by hours and instead by outcomes is the definition of empowerment.
1359174240923189250 2021-02-09 16:16:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @caseywinans @matthewrmottola Exactly.
1358863895524487172 2021-02-08 19:42:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake I've decided to stop writing much more than 1-2  sentences outside of once per week.
1358863302957367297 2021-02-08 19:40:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelwolber @JasonRBradwell I don't use em
1358863140415488004 2021-02-08 19:39:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Thanks, my man. Seemed to resonate, huh?
1358837138343739392 2021-02-08 17:56:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @matthewrmottola Get a job. Work in sprints. Put out good work. Build a portfolio. I'm not suggesting that people have to freelance. Work will change though. 8 hour days are going away.
1358826466788732929 2021-02-08 17:14:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort "To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work."  ― Cal Newport, Deep Work
1358805126677463042 2021-02-08 15:49:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The future of work is short sprints, not long days.
1358581880782807043 2021-02-08 01:02:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CorpoTuck Agreed that they could have done better than a heavily makeup'ed JA.
1358062290621374466 2021-02-06 14:37:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mission50k @SideHustler5 Thanks for the kind words and for the nice promotion, Dylan. Always appreciated. Cheers, man.
1358062032797450243 2021-02-06 14:36:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat This is such an awesome way to think about it. How unique...good stuff, Brian.
1358059867693531139 2021-02-06 14:27:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SideHustler5 @mission50k As an aside, it's just one of many formulas/styles I use.
1357831434749239299 2021-02-05 23:20:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattlady Congrats, Matt. I'm not sure if you know about this website, but it's been helpful for me.   Hope it is for you too.    https://t.co/nfndtZqC6N
1357741360892239872 2021-02-05 17:22:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Thanks, homie. 👋
1357701480434851850 2021-02-05 14:43:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Holds true to this day.
1357700018585673741 2021-02-05 14:38:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Observation:   Promoting others is a great form of self-promotion.
1357507610744934403 2021-02-05 01:53:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyork20 I think wealth is so contextual. The more money we’ve earned the more worried we’ve actually become.   What happens if we lose it??  Super weird. Totally recognize our privilege. Such an interesting, diverse topic.
1357505889415139329 2021-02-05 01:46:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyork20 What’s your takeaway?
1357504891862810628 2021-02-05 01:42:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyork20 Interesting answers...

1357113379094159360 2021-02-03 23:46:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo This is how I feel about recipes and cooking...  Making a great loaf of bread is about 20x more fulfilling than buying one. And the nutritional value is likely higher.  I suspect that when you build, you'll find a similar value increase.
1357063312018669572 2021-02-03 20:28:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DamianThompson Oh, I've been...it's one of my faves. She's an inspiration.
1357006698863558659 2021-02-03 16:43:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EarlyStageSales It's going to start happening very, very fast.  Too many options available for talented people.
1357004353350082565 2021-02-03 16:33:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Reward outcomes, not hours.

1356967776955604996 2021-02-03 14:08:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjkmccaffrey @thisiskp_ I use Airtable + Gmail to fire off relevant emails as I move clients through my pipeline. Been really helpful...
1356958411108339712 2021-02-03 13:31:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thisiskp_ It’s my favorite tool for my advising business today. I’ve automated so much cumbersome work using triggers.   Game changer.
1356681230411005952 2021-02-02 19:09:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collincadmus @chrisbits92 Agree with Collin.  I started around 20k, back when 20k was like 40k today.  I wish I would have even waited longer.
1356609083781087232 2021-02-02 14:23:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Do you even meditate??

1356321646148280320 2021-02-01 19:20:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @suhanachooli Sure thing, Suhana. Thanks for giving this a read. Glad you found some value in it. Cheers.
1356321553366069249 2021-02-01 19:20:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshua_hornby Thanks, Josh!
1356306321264533505 2021-02-01 18:20:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshua_hornby Personalized connection requests look like cold sales pitches waiting to happen, IMO.  If you're going to personalize it, try saying, "Love your content. Would like to connect to make sure I see it in my feed every day". Do 5-10 per day.
1356298087862562817 2021-02-01 17:47:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamuelBriskar Nothing more than just posting to LinkedIn with a coupon and letting people know there will only be 20 or so...  I don't do ads or paid marketing, just social media. Hope that helps!
1356295778386538501 2021-02-01 17:38:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SamuelBriskar Mostly just word of mouth sharing, and a few promotions. I don't promote often, but I'll get a nice spike when I choose to.
1356260452397948933 2021-02-01 15:17:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @domm  https://t.co/C77pa7u5n9
1356255093453070339 2021-02-01 14:56:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jenniferlund Thanks, Jennifer. I appreciate you reading and sharing. I know it was a long one!
1356234248483729410 2021-02-01 13:33:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StabileGabe Appreciate it, Gabe. Thems some big goals. 🔥
1356228551155003394 2021-02-01 13:10:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Thanks so much for taking the time to read this long thread.   If you found this helpful, I'd be honored if you checked out my newsletter.   https://t.co/vCOnWlle21  I write once a week about processes and systems that work for my solopreneur journey.  Cheers.
1356228547438850054 2021-02-01 13:10:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So, to get started, do the following:  Step 1: Pick something you excel at. Step 2: Choose something you're interested in. Step 3: Combine them creatively. Step 4: Weave a distribution system. Step 5: Allow an audience to form. Step 6: Ask them what they need.
1356228544972652548 2021-02-01 13:10:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Summary:  In summary, the internet is getting crowded.  Picking your passion and then trying to write or record from scratch each day can be a very daunting task.  Most of the compelling creators you see online have a system.
1356228541294256128 2021-02-01 13:10:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Others might want a Zoom call where you apply your formula to bottles in their collection together.  Some would just want to purchase a financial analysis of multiple bottles, without the call.  All of this can be placed on a value ladder that people can move up over time:  https://t.co/mphKIFv8UT
1356228529336299527 2021-02-01 13:10:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Ask on social or send out a survey via email. What would they like to learn? What would they be happy to spend some money on?  For example, people might enjoy a digital course teaching them your method behind wine price projections.
1356228526681284612 2021-02-01 13:10:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> No. 6: Product  Now comes the easiest part. Asking and listening.  With an audience built around a specific, unique idea, you can simply start to ask them what would be most helpful, and listen to their answers.   It’s amazing how many people skip this critical step.
1356228524210839553 2021-02-01 13:10:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you’re our finance/wine person from above, you will naturally attract an audience of people who love wine, sommeliers, and collectors.   But, you’re also likely to attract people who have an interest in data analysis, financial trends, the market, the exchanges, and so on.
1356228521178361859 2021-02-01 13:10:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> By distributing routinely, a natural audience will grow.   Remember, you don’t pick your audience, they pick you.   You simply set up a system where more people are likely to find you.
1356228517642579970 2021-02-01 13:10:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Here's where I'd recommend focusing and how I set up my own distribution (h/t to @GoodMarketingHQ for the structure idea, which I've changed a bit)  - Personal blog or newsletter - One social site to start - Industry sites - Private Slack Channels - Facebook groups  https://t.co/K4X9kTIG2m
1356228504736702466 2021-02-01 13:10:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Having a niche of one gives you an advantage bc you’ve increased the number of places you can distribute.   For example, if you’re our financial whiz/wine lover, you can distribute on sites centered around wine, the wine exchange, but also finance sites, market sites, etc.
1356228501377003523 2021-02-01 13:10:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> No. 4 &amp; 5: Distribution &amp; Audience  In order for people to discover your unique and interesting idea, they have to be able to find it. This is where distribution comes into play.   Your audience is an OUTCOME of good distribution.
1356228491843424257 2021-02-01 13:10:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's one single idea that can be produced and reproduced 1000x over.  The game of “what do I do today?” is now over.  These ideas, when shared broadly through proper distribution, attract a natural audience of interested people.
1356228453364871170 2021-02-01 13:10:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Example: You’re a financial analyst &amp; your interest is in wine.  Unique idea: Use your financial knowledge to project the value of one high-end wine bottle each morning.  You could easily argue that this idea is not interesting, but you’d be missing the larger point.  https://t.co/QfEnNWDHI7
1356228442161897472 2021-02-01 13:10:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> We’re back to the same old questions:  “What do I write about today?” “What do I paint today?" “What do I teach today?”  In a niche of one, you create one idea, and then learn how to say it, do it, or package it 1,000+ different ways.  Let’s use an example from above.
1356228439905349634 2021-02-01 13:10:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> For example, we’ve all had ideas before, but they end up as:  - Unfinished blog posts - Abandoned podcasts - Dwindling YouTube channels  That’s because the creation must be forced.   You’re starting from a blank canvas every morning.
1356228432359784454 2021-02-01 13:10:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> No. 3: Idea  The idea block of a niche of one is where most people get it wrong.   They let a lack of creativity keep them from building something unique.
1356228429813862401 2021-02-01 13:10:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Maybe you're fluent in English &amp; Portuguese and you’re extremely well-versed in marketing. Maybe you understand financial analysis and your hobby is high-end wine.  So, now what?  Let’s put one of them together to start formulating an interesting idea.
1356228390693564417 2021-02-01 13:10:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Let’s introduce interests into the equation and see what happens.  No 2: Interests  This article is not meant to be cliche: “Do something you love and you’ll never work a day in your life!”   Nonsense.  But, interests are important. They keep us...well…interested.
1356228386851598336 2021-02-01 13:10:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The difficulty arises when the inevitable question comes up:  “What do I write about today?” “What do I paint today?" "What do I teach today?”  When the brain faces a creative block, people either quit creating or create something subpar. Two poor outcomes.  https://t.co/maIheWmCie
1356228374574854158 2021-02-01 13:10:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Too often, people make the mistake of choosing a skill when deciding to create online.   I’m a writer, so I’ll write.  I’m a painter, so I’ll paint.  I know how to do X, so I’ll teach people how to do X.   You get the point.
1356228372456681475 2021-02-01 13:10:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Let's break them down and then put them back together to help you get started.  No 1: Skill  Most skills, by themselves, are not unique. Lots of people can write, speak English and Portuguese, or do financial analysis.
1356228369214562305 2021-02-01 13:10:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A niche of one is a unique combination of skills &amp; interests rolled into one idea and distributed through highly creative or technical content.  You become the category creator. The best in show. The only.  Here are the six building blocks behind a Niche of One.  https://t.co/AFoTizjSYq
1356228356635824129 2021-02-01 13:10:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The most compelling creators online are "a niche of one."  I've broken that down into 6 steps.  Let's do a deep dive. 👇🏻
1356200621456707585 2021-02-01 11:19:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lexpaval @icons_8 Excellent work, Alex. 🔥🔥
1355541907741548544 2021-01-30 15:42:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @narcoustic @amypeniston Nope, I figured I might as well show them what's working and what's not.  I think they appreciated the transparency along the way, which made them more likely to buy. I don't have data backing that up, but it's a gut feel.
1355537782685523973 2021-01-30 15:26:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @narcoustic @amypeniston Prelaunch was just an announcement with an early-bird discount. Then I built in public over that month.   Launch was simply announcing that it's coming out in X hours and this was your last chance to get it at the discounted rate.  Building in public was a huge move for me.
1355513455806197761 2021-01-30 13:49:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amypeniston @narcoustic I pre-launched my 2nd course on December 18th, and then launched it January 18th. Both days had pretty big spikes.
1355513261861576706 2021-01-30 13:48:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @constructionge3 I just mean to keep the price low enough that you don't exclude 90% of people like other courses do.
1355513145171857410 2021-01-30 13:48:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tejas3732 @gumroad I have 2 products. One to help people grow their audience on LinkedIn, and one to help people ideate and put together a digital product.
1355513002712330241 2021-01-30 13:47:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheStartUpSDR Thanks so much, Arthur. Appreciate it.
1355441650122838017 2021-01-30 09:04:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AZinkevich Thanks, Andrei. Best of luck on the launch. Lmk how it goes!
1355321816181575682 2021-01-30 01:07:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto You rock. Thanks, Aaron. Great job.
1355319477416685571 2021-01-30 00:58:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson Gut feel honestly.
1355309850893426698 2021-01-30 00:20:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MightyFineCopy_ @jmcmillen89 We loved Las Quince Letras. Have you been there?  There was another little restaurant we stopped at that I need to find...
1355308645634998277 2021-01-30 00:15:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MightyFineCopy_ @jmcmillen89 I salute you for living in Oaxaca. One of my favorite places. Jealous.
1355305982574911493 2021-01-30 00:05:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nazzagnl Cool. LMK if you have any questions, Nazzareno.  Cheers, man.
1355304309223776258 2021-01-29 23:58:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @walkingriver @gumroad Audience is important. 😃
1355303921439420417 2021-01-29 23:56:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @M_Gagliano More signups and completions on first course.   The 2nd course will make more money bc its 3x the price.
1355302612887891968 2021-01-29 23:51:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @M_Gagliano My last course was way too long. 3 hours and 28 minutes.  My first one? 75 minutes. MUCH easier to get through.  That said, I think the longer course is more valuable.
1355302243390672897 2021-01-29 23:50:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 About 75/25 social media vs. email list. I've also spent 2.5 years writing on LI each morning so it's paid off...
1355300839771004936 2021-01-29 23:44:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @walkingriver @gumroad I have 70k followers on LinkedIn, so that helps.   Pricing for access means making it affordable and accessible for people.   That's just my mantra because I can help more people and, in turn, they can tell more people.
1355299776586276864 2021-01-29 23:40:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto "Beautiful things don’t ask for attention."
1355298868880093187 2021-01-29 23:36:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmcmillen89 Thanks, Jacob. Appreciate it, man.
1355298775443660804 2021-01-29 23:36:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrentHolzheimer @gumroad Awesome - you're welcome, Brent.
1355294246245457921 2021-01-29 23:18:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @1pBetterDaily @Hustle_Smarterr Thank you!
1355287399182569475 2021-01-29 22:51:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WillAttract @gumroad Appreciate it, Will!
1355287337337499651 2021-01-29 22:50:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @getpaidwrite @gumroad Thanks!
1355287128641581061 2021-01-29 22:50:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JanelSGM Thanks, Janel!   I actually featured you in my new course, so hopefully more people will learn about your NewsletterOS and the awesome stuff you're creating.
1355263666338357251 2021-01-29 21:16:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau I haven't really given it much thought. It's mostly just fun for me, not something I'm actively trying to scale.  That could change in the future though...
1355263238729060354 2021-01-29 21:15:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ChrisRocas Appreciate you, Chris. Cheers, man.
1355262437415641089 2021-01-29 21:11:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau Appreciate you, Francois. Thanks, as always, for your support.
1355260386468048898 2021-01-29 21:03:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HilaryCorna @gumroad Sure thing, Hilary. Best of luck to you!
1355260307388719104 2021-01-29 21:03:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EarlyStageSales @thescottleese I try. Feel like there's no point in being someone different.
1355260203860688897 2021-01-29 21:03:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant @gumroad Thanks, Ali. Appreciate your support, my man. Always.
1355259352744124416 2021-01-29 20:59:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EarlyStageSales Thanks, man. Really fun ride.
1355259130869649412 2021-01-29 20:58:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Excited to move up the @gumroad board in 2021.
1355258906856071169 2021-01-29 20:57:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Hit $100k in revenue today.  All organic.  Here are 5 lessons I learned in 10 months:  1. Give 80%, Ask 20% 2. Brevity in courses is your friend 3. Price for access &amp; word of mouth 4. Answer all DMs about your product 5. Timebox, move fast, and start cheap  Hope that's helpful.  https://t.co/6ia1yTtOz7
1355257562619400195 2021-01-29 20:52:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chadladjev Ha. I use that phrase a lot being from the Midwest. It's a habit.
1355168416861188098 2021-01-29 14:58:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @debgotwired Outside of all of the free content I push out, I offer two courses on this subject as well.  You can check them out here:   https://t.co/DzX2ZVTWiV
1355167876794249222 2021-01-29 14:56:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @debgotwired I don't actually write on trends (Ironically, today was the one day I did) - I use a system of pillars &amp; core concepts. Essentially, I have a list of strong beliefs that I visit when I'm feeling creative. I'll usually write 4-5 posts at one time when I'm feeling it.
1355167194796187650 2021-01-29 14:53:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @debgotwired Sure thing. Here they all are:    https://t.co/ST3ZL528wN  I've also been writing every morning for 2.5 years. I saw very little traction until about month 10, but then it's been compounding like crazy.
1355164482096476163 2021-01-29 14:42:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @debgotwired What do you mean exactly? Sorry, want to make sure I understand what you're asking.
1355162221991616524 2021-01-29 14:33:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @debgotwired @arvidkahl More inbox messages than I could ever count, 30k+ website visitors and about $668k in sales.
1355096187792191488 2021-01-29 10:11:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sunnsidemedia I don’t recommend it.
1354881431760216066 2021-01-28 19:58:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Well, shit, man. Thanks.   Glad it kicked off some decent thoughts. Appreciate the kind shout.
1354852805090168832 2021-01-28 18:04:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattboneal @JamesClear Appreciate being in the same Tweet with one of my favorite authors.   Thanks, Matthew. Cheers.
1354232877077196804 2021-01-27 01:00:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @corprteUnicorn Feel this.
1354214756752764928 2021-01-26 23:48:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @briannekimmel Walked away from my executive role to work for myself.
1354138181751472128 2021-01-26 18:44:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanmcadams This one is for LinkedIn specifically. If interested in learning more, you can check out my course as well.   https://t.co/e3PpDSyL6K
1354132687351648257 2021-01-26 18:22:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DanishAgg Awesome - greatly appreciate that compliment, Danish.
1354131340137017345 2021-01-26 18:17:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @russleads Appreciate the share and the kind words, Russ. Cheers, man.
1354127999117963266 2021-01-26 18:04:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackmjfoster Appreciate you sharing, Jack. Cheers.
1354121310788583425 2021-01-26 17:37:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HilaryCorna Yep, try this: "Does anyone need to read this?"
1354120078451740672 2021-01-26 17:32:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thinkingovertea Basically 🙏
1354119402246045696 2021-01-26 17:29:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HilaryCorna That's awesome, Hilary. Nice work, and keep the momentum moving.
1354119305777078274 2021-01-26 17:29:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @laurieharrison Very infrequently, but yes. Probably once every other month or so.
1354117124692848642 2021-01-26 17:20:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @laurieharrison I don’t, to be honest. When I’m feeling creative, I might write 3-5 posts. When I’m not, zero.   I also recognize that even knowledge I think has no value, often does to other people.
1354106388822306817 2021-01-26 16:38:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @furkanpatan1 I try, but haven't found my Twitter "footing" yet.
1354106094138892289 2021-01-26 16:37:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rwilk Thanks so much for reading it, Robert. Cheers.
1354101876409708546 2021-01-26 16:20:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @realDavidGomez I’m sure they work but I go at it the old fashioned way.   Consistent output and trying to get 1% better each day.
1354100677149126662 2021-01-26 16:15:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nicolascole77 Thanks for sharing, Nicolas. Big fan of your essays. Cheers.
1354096631864565762 2021-01-26 15:59:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM @uxblake I do not. I do everything via Gumroad, but I'll upgrade in the future at some point.
1354088894074146820 2021-01-26 15:28:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @macedoh I don't actually know if it works on Twitter. I haven't really figured this platform out since I've spent most of my time on LinkedIn.  Sometimes I ask a question, but it feels "baity" if that makes sense...
1354086242409967616 2021-01-26 15:18:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ErinKGibbens Once someone does for me...haha.
1354082746843467784 2021-01-26 15:04:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinschless @uxblake @AlexLlullTW Could be true. I mostly share intentional content that helps solopreneurs run their business so it's not anything that people might find offensive or anything.
1354081843310637058 2021-01-26 15:00:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lukecannon727 I got more where that came from. Jk.   No secrets here, just helpful knowledge that I figured out over time.
1354081522802946053 2021-01-26 14:59:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nmsubra Steal away!
1354080789101744130 2021-01-26 14:56:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinschless Yeah, I think that would work. I'm much less comfortable with Twitter, so I hesitate to give advice like I would on LinkedIn.  Two guys who are nailing it and helping people grow on Twitter:  @uxblake  @AlexLlullTW
1354079236705951744 2021-01-26 14:50:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LenaSesardic Appreciate you sharing this, Lena. 🙌
1354078364068417541 2021-01-26 14:46:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant If you don't like my stuff, blame me :)  Thanks for sharing, Ali. Appreciate it, my man.
1354078210271678472 2021-01-26 14:46:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinschless So, rather than Tweet 3x per day, I'll probably just share less often, but with the hope of providing more value in each Tweet.
1354078070777524226 2021-01-26 14:45:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austinschless It's interesting. I just picked LinkedIn 2.5 years ago without much thought.  So, each hour I spend there is more valuable than an hour on Twitter at the moment.   I enjoy sharing threads like these on Twitter because people seem to get a lot of value out of them.
1354077752291418124 2021-01-26 14:44:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PeterPLai Of course. Using LI has been a game-changer. Growing organically is a bit easier than Twitter. Hope to see you on there!  Cheers.
1354076471065796615 2021-01-26 14:39:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PeterPLai I guess it depends on where you work and how they might think about it.  To me, my social media is mine, so that's how I've always treated it.   At the same time, I keep it pretty clean and helpful on LinkedIn, but that's just sort of who I am anyway.
1354072547923537924 2021-01-26 14:23:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wiesman Thanks so much for the share. Glad you found it helpful. Cheers.
1354072434471825409 2021-01-26 14:23:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markotalks It's mostly about consistency. That seems to be the key.  I've written every weekday for 2+ years now.
1354072226941837313 2021-01-26 14:22:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wiesman Yes - it definitely takes time, but it's one of the easier platforms to build an audience. I've been writing for over 2+ years consistently.  Try 2x to 3x per week for a month and you'll see some decent results.
1354070289022332931 2021-01-26 14:14:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hvidtfeld Appreciate that, Magnus. Thanks for taking the time to read it.
1354069508022022150 2021-01-26 14:11:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal It definitely works, the tricky part is not overdoing it. So, this is about 1 of 5 systems I follow when writing.
1354068941732270082 2021-01-26 14:09:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bausbrooks_ Thanks so much for sharing, Brandon (and for the kind words!)
1354068825248034817 2021-01-26 14:08:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Super kind of you to share this, Alex. I appreciate that.  Just on here learning from you.
1354068666711683072 2021-01-26 14:08:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pamparkerfoley2 @justinamash Sure thing, but wrong Justin tagged :)
1354067806241910791 2021-01-26 14:04:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @griffin_makokha Thanks so much for sharing it, Griffin. Cheers!
1354066827303907328 2021-01-26 14:01:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake @anthonydapiii  https://t.co/vgPuxcFspD
1354065934835716097 2021-01-26 13:57:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Well, ain't that kind, Blake.   Thanks, my friend. Looking forward to catching up today.
1354065113129623553 2021-01-26 13:54:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IamMBGriffin Thanks for sharing, Michelle, I appreciate it. Still figuring out Twitter, but got LinkedIn down to a science after 2.5 years 🧪
1354064376630804481 2021-01-26 13:51:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edchao2 Really interesting. I'm thinking of trailer like a movie trailer, but I never considered it could be thought of like a trailer being pulled by a car. Ha.
1354063286975791108 2021-01-26 13:46:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @im_usamakhalid Appreciate that, Usama. Cheers, man.
1354062089439092740 2021-01-26 13:42:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylewill Thanks for spending the time to read it, Kyle. Greatly appreciated. Cheers.
1354059302458286084 2021-01-26 13:31:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_beesea_ Awesome, glad you found it helpful. Thanks for taking the time to read it, Büşra.
1354058583164542976 2021-01-26 13:28:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TKaljo Thanks! This one was a lot of fun to write, to be honest.
1354054250163265536 2021-01-26 13:11:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. If you found this helpful, I'd be honored if you checked out my newsletter.  I write about once a week and try and processes and systems that work for my solopreneur journey.   https://t.co/GOmWBLygMj
1354054238641541120 2021-01-26 13:11:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So, remember:  - Step 1: Start with the meat. What are you teaching or suggesting? - Step 2: Create your trailer. Does each line get people to the next?  - Step 3: Make it easy to engage. Leave them with a short summary.
1354054208367063042 2021-01-26 13:10:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This particular post was seen 72,477 times, for 867 interactions and 166 comments. This is in line with a typical post for me each day.  https://t.co/Mhmy2kR3Sp
1354054192726499340 2021-01-26 13:10:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I want the reader to participate in the comments without having to reread the full piece.   So, I summarize it nicely for them at the end.  People read the last few lines, think of a response, and get participating.  https://t.co/GV6BqB89jZ
1354054131279945728 2021-01-26 13:10:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 3: The Summary and The Mantra  It's time to wrap the content.  My goal in the ending is to give the reader the entire piece of content packaged up nicely in a few sentences. Think of it as the summary of the content.
1354054123465940993 2021-01-26 13:10:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The hook line is the last line before the "…see more" button on the feed.  It's where readers commit to reading more or continuing their scroll.   If they click "see more", the trailer has done its job and they are onto the "meat", which I've already shared with you.  https://t.co/be4lAmjavn
1354054108127391745 2021-01-26 13:10:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I know my audience cares about getting people's attention.   The 1st line is short and gets their attention when scrolling.  The second line recommends they "help them in public". If they want to do that, they move to the 3rd line, the hook line:   "Here are 4 simple ideas:"
1354054101080944640 2021-01-26 13:10:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step Two: Write The "Trailer"  The trailer has 2 jobs:  - Break the scroll pattern with the first line. - Make each line intriguing enough to get the reader to the next one.  Here's the trailer for this particular piece of content.  https://t.co/YWK5CHCRxH
1354054085981429765 2021-01-26 13:10:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step one: Create the "Meat" of the content  The meat is the information I'm attempting to convey or teach. For example, I wanted to teach people how to get someone's attention on LinkedIn.   So, I wrote out 4 suggestions:  https://t.co/k6yR0B1TOo
1354054065890750465 2021-01-26 13:10:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Twitter generally hates LinkedIn.   But, I've generated 33.038M impressions in the last 2 years and built my business on it.  Here's one simple 3-step process I use for creating content quickly.  If interested, feel free to steal it👇🏻
1353842013968486401 2021-01-25 23:07:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryangum Yeah, I've just got a big following on LinkedIn, and haven't put the time into Twitter. I expect that as I do, things could change. Rebuilding landing pages now, so excited to release.
1353833435169771522 2021-01-25 22:33:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryangum The launch month ended up over $40k. In the last week, I've made about $2k, but haven't promoted yet (on purpose).  I have automation set up to ask for reviews on Gumroad to drive the conversion rates up. Once that happens, I'll start actively promoting once per week.
1353773973071396867 2021-01-25 18:37:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryangum Really interesting post, Ryan. Thanks for including me with some folks I admire greatly. Cheers.
1353709542144663553 2021-01-25 14:21:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Just how they are incentivized. Learn that and make much better choices.
1353708874499502080 2021-01-25 14:18:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Learn how people get paid.   You’ll make significantly better life choices.
1353423005205073925 2021-01-24 19:22:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kbdotfyi @Guideline401k Very cool. Not familiar with this company.  My wife, who manages our money, recently read The Simple Path to Wealth by @JLCollinsNH   Changed how we think about independence quite a bit. Highly recommend.
1353421263704829952 2021-01-24 19:15:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @poojalapasia It's such an important exercise in improving my mental health.
1353420779199860737 2021-01-24 19:13:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Thanks, Ali. I stress a lot about money, like most people.  When I sit down and go over my plan, it's such an immense feeling of relief. I highly recommend.
1353418655997034497 2021-01-24 19:05:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1 hour a month reviewing your retirement plan:   ⬇️ Stress ⬇️ Anxiety  ⬆️ Happiness ⬆️ Calm
1352347462254669825 2021-01-21 20:08:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GuyLigertwood You know I feel that.
1352309557440245767 2021-01-21 17:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Build while everyone else is distracted.
1352301518943354885 2021-01-21 17:06:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harrydry Perfect timing. Building a new landing page and now I've got a guide. Massive, Harry.
1352263023268941825 2021-01-21 14:33:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher Depends on your ability to tune out noise and sift through content built specifically to generate views rather than educate.   Learn? Yes.  Get distracted? Yes.   Conquer no. 2 and no. 1 is much easier today.
1352080025802207236 2021-01-21 02:26:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM  https://t.co/CSQK7SdeKP
1352049802096369674 2021-01-21 00:26:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegerhardt Jealous. One of my faves. Enjoy.
1352048745400193025 2021-01-21 00:21:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegerhardt You moved to Burlington? Nice, Dave.   Unsolicited recs:   Hen of the Wood is amazing.    Made Inn Vermont might be the wackiest and best BnB in history for visiting friends/family.
1351699725448323081 2021-01-20 01:15:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @celiapreihs @jackbutcher Awesome. Happy decade, Jack.   Hope all is well Butcher fam.  https://t.co/fFCuq8z1gl
1351622961120350210 2021-01-19 20:10:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal That's right.   Money is an outcome of other skills. But receiving it, in and of itself, is skilless.
1351622612649201669 2021-01-19 20:08:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Making money is not a skill.  It's an outcome.
1351561079118245889 2021-01-19 16:04:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM @5harath @uxblake Thank you my man. Much appreciated.
1351554464868671489 2021-01-19 15:37:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kenfitzg Hell yeah, Ken. See you on the journey. 💪🏻
1351336814402023425 2021-01-19 01:12:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hmizel Observation, motivational, analytical, tear down, etc.
1351329509266624513 2021-01-19 00:43:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat I love it. Platforms, to me, are all valuable. You just need to navigate and understand. Once you do, you can establish meaningful relationships on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, whatever.   Add value and get value.
1351310292186181636 2021-01-18 23:27:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmandaMGoetz Writing.  I’ve published every day for 2.5 years. Went back and looked at some old stuff. Yikes.   P.S. My wife is hooked on the sleep CBD. 💤
1351301786938744834 2021-01-18 22:53:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Thanks so much, Brian.  The Twitterverse has a lot of negative feelings re: LinkedIn but you get out what you put in.  It's been a business changing channel for me.
1351285083693592588 2021-01-18 21:47:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jessholsapple1 Exactly. This is what I was attempting to capture. Love that, Jessica.
1351249202106540037 2021-01-18 19:24:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chadladjev So far so good! 35 new students today and still have 36 minutes until the release.
1351231564827471874 2021-01-18 18:14:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @atsaminathan Yep - this is a message people need to hear often. Action leads to growth. Intentional action leads to success.
1351230278161866756 2021-01-18 18:09:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattlady Thanks, Matt. I've been doing this for the last few months and the outcomes become tough pills to swallow.  That helps push me along when I don't want to move.
1351228995342397445 2021-01-18 18:04:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Reframe how you talk about fear.  Instead of stating your fear, state the potential outcome.  It's not, "I'm too afraid to get started."   It's, "By never starting, I'm choosing future regret over slight discomfort now."  This helps drive action for me.
1351224612323995655 2021-01-18 17:47:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshcolter Awesome! Thanks for the support. Let’s go...
1351188321960153088 2021-01-18 15:22:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lukecannon727 Thanks Luke. Appreciate your support. 🙏
1350965576009723911 2021-01-18 00:37:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shl 👀  Already investing a bit, but tell me more...
1350953199994286089 2021-01-17 23:48:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM Hey Mike - not connecting could simply be an outcome of low visibility.   How are you sharing? Just on Twitter?
1350951995214061570 2021-01-17 23:43:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 @davegerhardt @nevmed @YouTube @HubSpot @Google @ecomchasedimond @TaylorOffer Thanks for the nice mention here, Daniel.  I always truly appreciate you taking the time to shine a spotlight on others.
1350922314091802632 2021-01-17 21:45:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tonystark2020s I'll never understand that "People person" to sales translation.  It's like saying, "I like football so I'm thinking about trying out for the NFL as a career."  Sales is a skill like throwing a ball and requires zero "people person-ing".
1350910252359802886 2021-01-17 20:57:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sylvainreiter Exactly. Your ideas reach millions of people.  Some may say, "I knew that".   To others? Gold.
1350906033116508161 2021-01-17 20:41:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshua_hornby Impostor syndrome can be crippling.  What I'm describing is actually less impostor syndrome and more an assumption that our knowledge is common when it's not.   We just think it is because we can't imagine not knowing it!
1350904043292545026 2021-01-17 20:33:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau We incorrectly assume that our journey, because we've been on it, is known by all.   I've done this so many times.
1350903331347165204 2021-01-17 20:30:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis The knowledge you think, "everyone knows" is often the most helpful.
1350902722153881608 2021-01-17 20:28:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People vastly underestimate the value of their knowledge.  Publish it and be pleasantly surprised.
1350524640733655040 2021-01-16 19:25:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ohpinion8ted When someone responds to your published position and suggests something different, you're forced to consider a viewpoint you hadn't previously considered.  Am I wrong to think that puts me in a position to think more critically?
1350523381939118080 2021-01-16 19:20:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ohpinion8ted The Tweet doesn't suggest that writing drives critical thinking.  It's having to defend my thoughts in public that is the driver.
1350504244516950019 2021-01-16 18:04:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM (Obviously Clubhouse is unrelated to this specific tweet about writing)
1350504130259918848 2021-01-16 18:04:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM I publish on LinkedIn, LinkedIn Newsletter, Twitter, a little on Quora, Clubhouse, 2 private Slack channels, and once in a while on Medium.
1350501326644506625 2021-01-16 17:53:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Thanks, Ali. Between LinkedIn, Twitter, and several other sites, I've produced nearly 900 pieces of short content.  Been wild to look back and see the progress.  Keep it going. You will not regret it.
1350501064148135936 2021-01-16 17:51:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EarlyStageSales When you've hit the 6-month mark (or even 3) look backward.   You'll be amazed at your progress as a writer or creator.
1350500056852529152 2021-01-16 17:47:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've written every day for 2.5 years now.  Publishing my thoughts means having to defend them.  Such natural practice for thinking more critically.
1350110943498350593 2021-01-15 16:01:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @orangebook_ Damn.   A simple, effective, necessary question.
1350091414756085762 2021-01-15 14:44:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KishlaySays I do a bunch of things:  - Run an advisory firm for early-stage health tech SaaS companies.  - I’m an executive coach to founders.  - I build digital products online - I’m an LP at a rolling fund
1350087630222987268 2021-01-15 14:29:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KishlaySays Yep. Pharma and Med device from 2003-2009.
1349873772849987588 2021-01-15 00:19:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jbplat Yep. Overnight success stories are never actually overnight.   You just weren't paying attention when they were failing.
1349857883161288705 2021-01-14 23:16:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WalkerLucas At the time, yes.   Now? Zero.   I deserved it and it was a tough lesson that made me who I am today.
1349854326043398149 2021-01-14 23:02:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GuyLigertwood Same 😀
1349854281281773568 2021-01-14 23:01:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Same here. My failures were the lead up to my successes.
1349854192979075074 2021-01-14 23:01:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @cjpattss I needed to learn that my actions had consequences. Once I learned that...life became a lot better.
1349840959589281793 2021-01-14 22:08:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itssarabeam Same. Those mistakes are still enormous fuel to my fire.
1349840884557348865 2021-01-14 22:08:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewkkirk My interview at ZocDoc was a web of architected, pretend performance. Lots of photoshop.   🤷‍♂️
1349840704068079618 2021-01-14 22:07:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Thanks, Ali. Greatly appreciate that man.
1349835948461273088 2021-01-14 21:49:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The first 6 years of my career were a failure.   - Fired 3 times - Never hit a quota - Never made a sale  12 years after all of that, I still remain thankful for the experience.   Learning about failure early can be incredibly motivating.
1349544205312524288 2021-01-14 02:29:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @anthilemoon @JamesClear  https://t.co/NxnwQNDZWf

1349542637070675969 2021-01-14 02:23:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @anthilemoon @JamesClear  https://t.co/kEg0I7Rsbr
1349540567382949889 2021-01-14 02:15:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @anthilemoon @JamesClear Do you drink Americanos? Became my house drink a few years back.
1349509416819826689 2021-01-14 00:11:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @creation247 Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
1349504349467242498 2021-01-13 23:51:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesClear 1) Negroni.   It’s a classic 1:1:1 ratio but I pour a slightly heavy hand of Sipsmith Gin. Combine with Campari and Antica Vermouth.   2) Americano  Sub out gin in the above drink and add club soda. A delicious, bitter Italian aperitif that everyone should be drinking.
1349492801877192704 2021-01-13 23:05:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @projectkwill Same here. Just get it done.
1349492736005730308 2021-01-13 23:05:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshua_hornby @SteveBartlettSC I absolutely love this. Going to consider doing my own text group.   Thank you for sharing.
1349489449932120066 2021-01-13 22:52:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joshua_hornby No science on why, just some reported data from studies.   For me, the choice was about bursts.   I’ve always felt like I excelled when forced to produce rapidly and then took breaks.   Might be more personal than anything.
1349424405001093122 2021-01-13 18:33:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JaviEug Same here. Optimism leads to creative thinking.   Creative thinking leads to creative solutions and better outcomes.
1349407130600812549 2021-01-13 17:25:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoePompliano @JJWatt @JustinTuck @lancearmstrong @darrenrovell Their Run Wild IPA is phenomenal.  I'm interested to see how companies like Athletic Brewing push the big brewers to commit to something NA. Already happening at Brooklyn Brewing.
1349396792337690629 2021-01-13 16:44:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vickks Thanks, Vivek. I’ve just seen it over and over again.
1349394183564496898 2021-01-13 16:33:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Bucket 1 can be ok if it’s a fleeting thought. It just can’t be turned into an ideology.   Bucket 2 is learned by overcoming bucket 1 again and again.
1349393086414266372 2021-01-13 16:29:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis Damn. Love that.
1349391349355843584 2021-01-13 16:22:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal It’s remarkable how many people have hardwired themselves to believe everything is impossible.
1349390746932146177 2021-01-13 16:19:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Optimism is a business super power.   Great leaders solve problems before pessimists finish talking about why it can’t be done.
1349123532014415874 2021-01-12 22:38:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales @kyleplacy @Its_Jenn_Here No but Ny interest is piqued!
1349113505727860736 2021-01-12 21:58:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales @kyleplacy I hate small talk. Clubhouse is my nightmare.
1349034531521769476 2021-01-12 16:44:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Yep. I've been writing daily for 30 months now.  When I started, I was slow and awful.  Now a bit faster and slightly better.
1349029508410728450 2021-01-12 16:24:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How to create content more quickly:  Step 1 - Make a  list of strong opinions  Step 2 - Make a list of favorite content structures  Step 3 - Combine &amp; brain dump  Step 4 - Edit  Step 5 - Post
1348818633531781125 2021-01-12 02:26:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJackieHermes Haha. Thanks, Jackie. 😀
1348752586388746240 2021-01-11 22:04:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tyleramarcus @gurd3v Thanks, Tyler. Appreciate you reading.
1348679608988819463 2021-01-11 17:14:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gurd3v It's a short read and maybe the best actual "blog" or long-form I've written, IMO. I hate long-form writing.
1348679209284231176 2021-01-11 17:12:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gurd3v I've had impostor syndrome my whole life. I've found that harnessing it can actually be quite powerful.  I also try to think through impostor syndrome objectively.   I wrote an article about it, actually.   https://t.co/RtpijzTlHg
1348678851296165891 2021-01-11 17:11:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikeyMHook Yep - it's great to think through this often so when you panic one day (it will happen) you've already been through the exercise enough to stay calm.
1348676364459761665 2021-01-11 17:01:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @taimurharry Start by micro-niching. Combine skills + interests to create a "niche of one".  This is literally the foundation behind my new course.
1348676197488668673 2021-01-11 17:00:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Yep - then it's, "what can I do to extend this?" or "what other bets can I make that are easy and could have a big impact?".
1348675697980661763 2021-01-11 16:58:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelwolber Thanks, Mike. I feel like most people worry about this, and it's totally ok.   Just rethink the outcomes and you'll realize it's likely not worth worrying so much.
1348674017704747009 2021-01-11 16:51:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KevinEkmark Exactly. I feel like the skills I’ve learned as a solopreneur could be extremely useful in a company setting if I ever need to do that.
1348673103002525702 2021-01-11 16:48:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese I worry about failure every day, which keeps me driving forward.   Reframing the outcomes helps me remember that everything is likely going to be OK.
1348671899132456960 2021-01-11 16:43:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Something I ask myself every day is, "What if I fail as a solopreneur?"  Here's my answer:  The worst outcome is I go back to work in tech.  The best outcome is I live the life I want with total control.  Huge upside. Decent downside.  Daily reminders reduce fear &amp; stress.
1348637698840539137 2021-01-11 14:27:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jaclynmullen @nicklowthorpe @businessbarista The stigma attached to sales is because most people are bad at it.   Truly incredible salespeople are nothing like how they are portrayed in the movies, TV, etc.
1348464197328363521 2021-01-11 02:58:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sacca @Browns @BuffaloBills I don’t know anyone doing this.   If you are, please stop. Go Browns.  (From a nervous Browns fan up 25)
1348348476510380036 2021-01-10 19:18:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone is so focused on doing what they love.  I just want to avoid what I hate.
1348340851643191296 2021-01-10 18:48:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nicklowthorpe @businessbarista That’s so interesting. A huge misconception is that selling is an art.   It’s a science that one can learn so when people learn it, they get a huge leg up on their competition.
1348318386003046406 2021-01-10 17:18:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @businessbarista - selling - critical thinking - data analysis
1348060299757285385 2021-01-10 00:13:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pm @semil The idea that Parler will be deciding something they have already decided themselves is silly at best, misleading at worst.
1347985695915335684 2021-01-09 19:16:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arteeninLA September. It's just a guess and a cheap flight so I can repurpose if we're not ready.
1347976263521226754 2021-01-09 18:39:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @george__mack Good Lord is this an excellent Tweet.
1347975920901042176 2021-01-09 18:37:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn September right now...Too hot in the summer.
1347974609828777989 2021-01-09 18:32:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn Merida, MX.
1347968253373665283 2021-01-09 18:07:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ProductIsLife Haha. I’m sure you are not.
1347955649448189954 2021-01-09 17:17:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ErinKGibbens Airlines are offering flexible changes right now, meaning if I can't travel because of COVID, I can use it another time.
1347955225097883648 2021-01-09 17:15:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvglantin Debatable! :)
1347954238656303104 2021-01-09 17:11:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vyara Therapeutic.
1347954055457468418 2021-01-09 17:11:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LenaSesardic Oof 😂
1347953583862517765 2021-01-09 17:09:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LenaSesardic Me too. Just looking around at restaurants and tours has been fun. It's highly unlikely, but...good for my brain.
1347953349874884612 2021-01-09 17:08:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LenaSesardic Merida, MX.
1347952132603969536 2021-01-09 17:03:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I just booked a 100% refundable, post-COVID vacation.  Feel like this is really good for my soul.  May never go, but just putting one together rewires my brain.
1347688253692981252 2021-01-08 23:34:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ijaurec I definitely give my take on politics quite often. No shame in that game, IMO.  I just don't argue with people until it becomes problematic and I don't obsess over it until it consumes my life.  Too much trouble there.
1347617575346298884 2021-01-08 18:54:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Thanks! Always my goal.   I hate all the pomp and circumstance when buying so I skip it when selling.
1347615915253374976 2021-01-08 18:47:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Yep. That feels like the right way to do it.  If you take people on your journey as a teacher, the promotion comes naturally (at least it has for me so far)
1347615703394873349 2021-01-08 18:46:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bdrhoa You can deliver short-term results in a long-term relationship.  What I meant by that is, if you keep saying yes to every dollar that comes your way, regardless of fit or length of the relationship, you'll struggle to set yourself up for long term success.
1347614911107641344 2021-01-08 18:43:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Absolutely. Anything, in particular, that's been extra challenging?
1347608928956403713 2021-01-08 18:19:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SolidGoldNicole I've niched down so far that every client I take on is exactly in my bullseye. Been so helpful.
1347608709875249157 2021-01-08 18:18:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson  https://t.co/jV0j3uOtBA
1347608508422905864 2021-01-08 18:18:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EarlyStageSales @zapier Love both, glad they were helpful!
1347607308327677955 2021-01-08 18:13:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Of course. Hoping these benefit someone out there.
1347607230531719168 2021-01-08 18:12:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mission50k Well, thanks, Dylan.   Figure if I ran into these, thousands of others probably have to. Cheers, man.
1347605966112645127 2021-01-08 18:07:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 hard lessons from 17 months of self-employment:  - If you're unsure, say no - Eliminate / automate / delegate - Share results in public → gain attention - Chase short-term $ → miss long-term $$$
1347546555641954304 2021-01-08 14:11:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @LuisANavia @justinekedi @AyAy_Ron69 @timsalau Appreciate you, Edward.
1347543608774316041 2021-01-08 14:00:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mission50k @money_seeds @Wealthsimple Yeah I can appreciate that process and the enjoyment for sure.   I had a helluva time with Wealthsimple customer service so I went to Wealthfront.
1347538780367020037 2021-01-08 13:40:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mission50k @money_seeds Hey Dylan - Have you tried Wealthfront? Free and does an exceptionally good tracking this.   Started using it about 8 months ago.
1347346025942552577 2021-01-08 00:54:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @deckerspectre Agreed.
1347324676951957507 2021-01-07 23:30:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 Nah. Just early!
1347324391647043585 2021-01-07 23:29:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 Thanks for the shout, my man.  Cheers 🥂
1347316224062054403 2021-01-07 22:56:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @timbarnes10 Exactly. Obviously, we all need to move our businesses forward, but I prefer to skip the pomp and circumstance of backroom messaging and massaging of statements.
1347300918216294402 2021-01-07 21:55:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One of the great benefits of solopreneurship is that I can work underneath my own values.   I don’t have to report to a workplace that pretends to care about yesterday.
1347220854279696385 2021-01-07 16:37:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JuiceboxCA @PixarSoul Great takeaway. Watched it last night and that never occurred to me.   Excellent movie.   Would be interested to see what the book equivalent of Soul is i.e. delivers a similar message.
1346902237931589635 2021-01-06 19:31:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyork20 The least lonely thing ever.   More time with my wife and the people I enjoy.   That's my 2 cents!
1346866255593164809 2021-01-06 17:08:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jessicameher @WalkerLucas I feel like I could go down a rabbit hole with rap quotes on this one.
1346859708091654144 2021-01-06 16:42:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The best people on Twitter have become their own product.  Zero competition.  A niche of one.
1346650921166659588 2021-01-06 02:52:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vyara Absolutely I did.
1346638384245190662 2021-01-06 02:03:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LenaSesardic When someone introduces you to someone else without asking your permission.  The double opt-in is standard.   “Hi Lena - wanted to intro you to my friend who needs XYZ (see her email below) - that ok with you?”
1346638048868626434 2021-01-06 02:01:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @WalkerLucas I’ve had that happen a few times. This person tonight was just like:  “Hey! Never asked permission but meet this random person and hop on the phone to help her out!”  Wacky.
1346635164156391424 2021-01-06 01:50:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I just got a single opt-in intro.  Very simple rule:  - Don't do that. Ever.
1346611628041785344 2021-01-06 00:16:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @Twitter @FitFounder @dvassallo @APompliano I enjoy @yongfook @ThatChristinaG and @schlaf   Always very solid.
1346609430880788482 2021-01-06 00:08:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @Twitter @FitFounder @dvassallo @APompliano Thanks, my man. Love these accounts as well. Cheers, Edward.
1346606985777729536 2021-01-05 23:58:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EarlyStageSales Every morning I wake up to 100k+ people talking about politics on the trending section of Twitter...  But they "don't have time" for meaningful things.   SMH.
1346606445379407873 2021-01-05 23:56:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I know people that have ruined their lives arguing politics online.  - Lost their mind - Lost their family - Lost their friends - Even lost their job  And do you know what impact they've made?  Zero.
1346535153678606336 2021-01-05 19:12:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ericjacobbutton @uxblake Damn, I love that quote. Thanks for sharing.
1346496019916328962 2021-01-05 16:37:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffignacio Yep. If you hate something, Christ, stop doing it.
1346495945270292493 2021-01-05 16:37:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Very underrated. It’s painful to watch someone produce something when their heart is so out of it.
1346492737655345155 2021-01-05 16:24:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It’s easy to tell when a creator doesn’t like what they are doing.  Quitting isn't always a bad decision.
1346452474144694272 2021-01-05 13:44:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kathleencelmins That's awesome. 2 hours is a bit too much for my attention span, so that's why I chose 1.  Tinker around and see what works for you. Good luck!
1346428609905491972 2021-01-05 12:09:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sughanthans1 @mikaelfyi I just celebrate with something small (read a chapter of a book or catch an episode of my favorite show) whenever I accomplish something small and meaningful.  I don't break anything down, I just go with what feels natural.  Remember, big goals are just small goals stacked up.
1346428367072071682 2021-01-05 12:08:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chadladjev I have three dogs. They are just small and are mostly indoor dogs (&lt;10lbs)
1346215613874712577 2021-01-04 22:03:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Sysode @jasonvana @EliusSantos @ThatChristinaG Hey Reece - it takes a ton of time and effort. I’ve been doing it for 2.5 years every single weekday.   But...damn...worth it. I run my whole business off of it.
1346214823076507652 2021-01-04 21:59:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 @andreasjonssonn @chrisbits92 @ameliasordell Really nice of you to say, Daniel. 🙏🏻  I'm sure, with your commitment, you'll be lapping me soon :)
1346213565544472577 2021-01-04 21:55:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn @chrisbits92 @Dmurr68 @ameliasordell Thanks, homie!
1346172446001549313 2021-01-04 19:11:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM @Sathyanand1985 @daily__visual @JamesClear @uxblake @craigburgess @dickiebush Thanks so much, Mike. There are a lot of great follows out there:  Check out @thepatwalls &amp; @sweatystartup.  Great content from both.
1346170783513640962 2021-01-04 19:05:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kennethburke423 Dunno. I think anything is possible when you set the right expectations.
1346167160972988416 2021-01-04 18:50:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kennethburke423 We both get up at the same time (6a-ish) but I've rejiggered my Calendly to take meetings from 10:30a to 2:30p.   Our walks are from 8:30a to 10:00a, then I shower and get the day started.
1346150160309620738 2021-01-04 17:43:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jabbawy @dwilliamriggs @Shopify @privy Very cool, thanks for sharing, Ben. Just sent out an update to my list today where I've shown my contacts are worth about $1.10 per year, but I'm a solopreneur with a few info products.  Going to be interesting to see how I can improve.  Thanks again.
1346146270377877504 2021-01-04 17:27:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs @jabbawy @Shopify Interesting. Is this suggesting the yearly value of an email is $33? Seems high to me, but then again, I'm just a solo creator without my emails optimized or anything like that.
1346145223324422147 2021-01-04 17:23:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JeffHawkes @wacky_packy @gumroad Awesome. Thank you so much for the support, Jeff. Almost done. Can’t wait to release.
1346145058702184459 2021-01-04 17:22:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis Thanks, Edward!
1346144997545037829 2021-01-04 17:22:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesBerges1 One of my favorite authors is @JamesClear   I need to reread this year.
1346138566284480513 2021-01-04 16:56:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis I agree with this so much. Keeps me feeling like I have a life during this pandemic.
1346136882191753216 2021-01-04 16:50:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ptwittee @getshieldapp Boom! Congrats :)
1346136805331103744 2021-01-04 16:49:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikaelfyi - Walk to get a coffee with my wife - Read a chapter of a fiction book - Catch an episode of Schitt's Creek - Listen to some music - Go out to lunch  Small celebrations during the work day make them feel special.
1346136604826624001 2021-01-04 16:49:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hrishio But big wins come from the consistency and aggregation of small wins. So why not celebrate those?
1346136495724367872 2021-01-04 16:48:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickB2005 I agree. We celebrated a lot at my previous job, and I do now that I'm a solopreneur. It can get pretty miserable if you're not congratulating yourself every once in a while.
1346136334738587651 2021-01-04 16:48:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tpelligrino @SlackHQ @NotionHQ That's awesome, man. Take yourself out and celebrate.
1346135161310732291 2021-01-04 16:43:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> As a culture, we've normalized celebrating only big wins.  To me, a motivating habit is to celebrate small accomplishments, much more often.  Celebrate 2-3 times every day.  Anyone else applied this?
1346128637578387458 2021-01-04 16:17:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wacky_packy @gumroad Thanks, Imran! Looking fwd to getting this out there soon, my man.
1346072048020451328 2021-01-04 12:32:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sharfunnisa Of course. No credit needed. I’m not the first person to do it, I’m sure...
1345915465684692993 2021-01-04 02:10:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @engelbreX Concretely and quantitatively it lowered my weight and blood pressure.   It also greatly reduced my stress.  Being away from the phone and engaged with my wife for 90 minutes was great.
1345904062022213638 2021-01-04 01:25:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tami__mcqueen @BIPCapital Super dope. Congrats, Tami 💪🏻
1345899939931557892 2021-01-04 01:08:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis Oh, I have for sure. I’ve been self-aware enough to realize that it’s irritating :)   So now we talk about the future, dreams, fun stuff...It’s a great walk through Shelby Park here in Nashville.
1345899656216260608 2021-01-04 01:07:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YudaTeich Start with just 15 minutes. Work your way up. You got it 🤛🏻
1345898170497314817 2021-01-04 01:01:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis Much happier. I tend to talk about work when I’m walking so I need to tamp that down a bit...
1345898045670641664 2021-01-04 01:01:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @s3rgioaguirre Yep - the 2 toddlers is the difference. No kids here, just 3 dogs.  Your plan sounds great, though.
1345897834911043584 2021-01-04 01:00:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YudaTeich What’s standing in your way, at the moment?
1345895751646384128 2021-01-04 00:52:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @s3rgioaguirre Just about a week. Stronger legs, better stamina, more ideas, happier couple.
1345893051957436416 2021-01-04 00:41:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> - I'm bad at disconnecting from my phone - I'm bad at finding time to exercise each day - I'm bad at finding alone time with my wife  So, last year, I combined all 3.  90-minute, no phone, 6 mile walks each AM with my wife.   Game changer.
1345881380597751808 2021-01-03 23:55:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake @mateogrowth @PaikCapital Thanks, Mateo. No FOMO necessary. We’re all just figuring it out on this journey of life. 💪🏻
1345803413708279809 2021-01-03 18:45:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @atsaminathan @andreasjonssonn @dvassallo @visualizevalue @davegerhardt @CJ_Johnson17th I feel like BOST was a very, very worthwhile purchase.  It's really about the principles needed to think through how to build online over the long-term.  It's not gimmicky or hacky at all. It's just principles + some instructions that help you stay focused on the right work.
1345793262842425345 2021-01-03 18:04:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn @andreasjonssonn @dvassallo @visualizevalue @davegerhardt @CJ_Johnson17th @freelancenotion LinkedIn has incredible organic reach at the moment.   Also, IndieHackers has some nice channels too.   I just prereleased my next info product on LinkedIn about 17 days ago and have 30k in preorders.
1345792010192609280 2021-01-03 17:59:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Natalie_Furn @andreasjonssonn @dvassallo @visualizevalue @davegerhardt @CJ_Johnson17th Absolutely. Why not?   Do you have a good channel for distribution?
1345788933637103616 2021-01-03 17:47:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Miche_McLennan @edward_gorbis @Dmurr68 @mayagrosmn @jessicachenpage @SoulcastMedia @timsalau Thanks, Edward!
1345777035327787008 2021-01-03 17:00:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PatScanlan94 @ScottIngram I'll probably try that at some point. Just feel like I can get into a good groove for 60. It's probably different for everyone.
1345776802711674880 2021-01-03 16:59:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MiaKiraki  https://t.co/XrfrvwHWaS
1345776740338167808 2021-01-03 16:59:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Adgenius  https://t.co/XrfrvwHWaS  Mostly principles around building online, growing on Twitter, and helping write better...really enjoyed them.
1345776428193886210 2021-01-03 16:57:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Thanks, Ali. Appreciate that, man.
1345776370824183808 2021-01-03 16:57:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn - Anyone Can Grow a Twitter Audience by @dvassallo  - Build Once, Sell Twice by @visualizevalue  - The Laws of Copywriting by @davegerhardt  - Twitter Money by @CJ_Johnson17th   All different, all a lot of fun to go through.
1345769259742490627 2021-01-03 16:29:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I purchased 4 info products in 2020.  They all paid me back at least 10x.   Great info products are like books without the filler.
1345728928909045760 2021-01-03 13:49:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IndieHackers I’m actually learning more about Indie Hackers.
1345719506736472064 2021-01-03 13:11:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrisbits92 Not anytime soon given my following but let’s wait a year. I’m bullish.
1345705267493822467 2021-01-03 12:15:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn 2nd guy to mention that. Need to look it up. Sounds like me and this Pomodoro guy might’ve gotten along.
1345705029194412036 2021-01-03 12:14:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @UltraAnshul Often, I’ll read a chapter of a book or chat with my wife or go for a short walk.
1345577071104417798 2021-01-03 03:45:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @atxnetsfan @YanceySanderson  https://t.co/4ITUuk2NVw
1345576734838677504 2021-01-03 03:44:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_beaumont @michaelwolber I block mondays and fridays both.  The appointment times can vary slightly so that I can best serve my customers but I’m usually pretty darn close to 1030 to 230.
1345576449248518147 2021-01-03 03:43:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tyleramarcus That’s exactly what I’m focusing on. No phone, no Twitter or social. Just 60 flat then break.
1345576279706316802 2021-01-03 03:42:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffignacio @TheJonFedor They mimic the structure but not the intensity because they are “working 8 hour days”.   I think we would see an increase in intensity by focusing on shorter work days with emphasis on better sprints.
1345575791841726464 2021-01-03 03:40:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @emiliadanzica I’ve tried but find that I can cruise pretty well for 60. Will keep experimenting though.
1345548823817551875 2021-01-03 01:53:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AshleighatWork @jeffbajorek Three accounts I enjoy are @uxblake, @brandonthezhang and @AlexLlullTW
1345548422917578754 2021-01-03 01:51:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jadesai94 Exactly. Work really hard but time box that effort. Then relax, think, exercise, etc...
1345548213286264833 2021-01-03 01:51:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KevinEkmark I think so too.   If I were building a company, I think this would be worth a try.   Pay 100% OTE for 50% of the time spend. Hire top talent.
1345541337874116609 2021-01-03 01:23:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelwolber It’s booked inside the time blocks which has worked really well.
1345541231208755202 2021-01-03 01:23:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @devantelj Will definitely share. Thanks!
1345541168906596353 2021-01-03 01:23:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LenaSesardic I will. Will give you some updates as I go.
1345541087759372290 2021-01-03 01:22:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat It’s an average. I feel like I can be more productive but my goal in 2021 is to sprint more and work less from a time perspective.
1345530415373819908 2021-01-03 00:40:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most people are productive only 3 hours per day.  So I'm time-boxing my work from 10:30a to 2:30p.  • 60-minute sprint → 30-minute break • 60-minute sprint → 30-minute break • 60-minute sprint   Leaves plenty of time to exercise &amp; think.  Let’s see how this experiment goes.
1345452109651718144 2021-01-02 19:29:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JamesBerges1 This is a really cool thread. Gonna dive in. Thanks for sharing!
1345448499899465729 2021-01-02 19:14:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @learnactrepeat It's so true. An exhilarating experience.
1345439030356439040 2021-01-02 18:37:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rstone57 I feel like a lot of people must feel this way...
1345435093331038210 2021-01-02 18:21:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sevendaymvp and form more solid relationships.
1345434357692067841 2021-01-02 18:18:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson Really good idea. Love that.   Going to manicure my feed this year.
1345427060425166849 2021-01-02 17:49:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelwolber Exactly. Start small here and grow over time. Should be a good journey.
1345426940325474305 2021-01-02 17:49:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson I've got a really large following on LinkedIn, but not so much here.   When I follow accounts with 100k and they post 20x a day, it can feel deflating.  Following smaller, growing accounts has been really fun.
1345425409643577347 2021-01-02 17:43:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> An interesting Twitter observation:  Following extremely popular accounts is great, but their quantity and engagement prompt FOMO for me.  Following accounts on your growth trajectory can feel more empowering.   Like you're growing together, not playing catch up...
1345250555321585664 2021-01-02 06:08:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort You got it last year!
1345244553947852800 2021-01-02 05:44:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2021 off to a pretty darn good start for this Buckeye.   G’night.  https://t.co/8Q9h0DErH9
1344724572646633475 2020-12-31 19:18:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ActiveCampaign Yep. Get the people part right and the rest comes with it.
1344684861685170177 2020-12-31 16:40:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @APompliano This is great.   2020 was a fun year for distribution, but siloed to one channel. Excited to start a bigger, longer journey in 2021.   This insight is excellent and a nice hit to keep me going.   Also, up 25% on BTC in 20 days. Thanks!
1344645262153801728 2020-12-31 14:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JanelSGM @thisiskp_ @randomlysampled @anthilemoon Congrats, Janel! Well deserved. Cheers to your accomplishments.
1344375353532416003 2020-12-30 20:10:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM @imbayodele The opposite is true.  Algorithms (social media) change constantly.   The way humans select tribes and make decisions has stayed relatively constant for centuries.
1344351787013332997 2020-12-30 18:36:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeremydstubson Same here. Much more applicable everywhere else in life.
1344342899056644097 2020-12-30 18:01:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher Vanguard sends me and my wife each an enormous packet once per day for two weeks if I change my profile phone number.
1344331566764478464 2020-12-30 17:16:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kokasexton And the great part is, they don't change all that much over centuries.   What was true in early Dale Carnegie books holds mostly true today.
1344326647701450752 2020-12-30 16:57:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @quinnemmett Everyone trying to hack/guess the algorithm. Just learn how people operate and you'll be better off.
1344321207001358338 2020-12-30 16:35:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Stop studying algorithms and start studying people.
1344273799458549761 2020-12-30 13:27:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThatChristinaG Yep - it's a class called "Parents".   Some have great teachers. Others? Not so much.
1344077465682120706 2020-12-30 00:26:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tami__mcqueen 😂
1344076548362686465 2020-12-30 00:23:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tami__mcqueen Thanks, Tami. Looking fwd to seeing more of you on here in 2021 per your recent tweet. Happy Holiday.
1344019296448442370 2020-12-29 20:35:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JuiceboxCA I find people use that phrase as a passive aggressive way to say they don't believe in some of what was said.   It's most commonly followed by, "...but..."   I'd rather hear, "I don't agree with all of what you said and here's why"
1343971056827179009 2020-12-29 17:24:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThisIsParsons Yeah, I think it might, but definitely agree with action.  People spend so much time saying "it can't be done!" instead of just trying to see if it can be.  Feels like a mindset issue. Probably both.
1343967500493606912 2020-12-29 17:09:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThisIsParsons Often I find that the difference between those who grow and those who don't is simply optimism vs. pessimism.
1343962191897260037 2020-12-29 16:48:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThatChristinaG @Dmurr68 Right back atcha. 💪🏻
1343961043136077825 2020-12-29 16:44:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 @ThatChristinaG Thanks, man. Still figuring this one out, but really meeting some great people...Nice work on your end. Been fun to watch.
1343960288274640899 2020-12-29 16:41:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Dmurr68 @ThatChristinaG Just started playing in the game...been fun so far.  https://t.co/vh5FDA6lcm
1343958331392733185 2020-12-29 16:33:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @erikbison Yes...good point, Erik. Understanding where you are going and why is critical. It will help keep you motivated during times where it feels like nothing is working.
1343958012625616896 2020-12-29 16:32:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Keep it simple. Focus on quality of content. Once you have validated interest, you can upscale quality of production. Just my opinion.
1343955995958112257 2020-12-29 16:24:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattladydigital Lots of people talk a great game. Very few act one.
1343955259333500928 2020-12-29 16:21:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you say you want to grow but you don't:  - Take any risks - Invest in yourself - Ask hard questions - Overcome your fears - Learn new perspectives - Network w/ smart people  Then, you don't really want to grow.  You just want to tell people that you do.
1343726326239404032 2020-12-29 01:11:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_its_greg Awesome, Greg. Great work. Keep those ideas flowing. 💡
1343616618891456514 2020-12-28 17:55:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. What’s done?  v1 had 5 Parts, 11 Chapters, &amp; 48 different lessons. Realized there was some fluff included.   Showed a few friends, they agreed.  v2 has 3 Parts, 7 Chapters, &amp; 23 lessons. Each of the lessons is intended to pack a punch.  Lesson - Keep it simple and powerful  https://t.co/1bXdWPW8TH
1343616615460560897 2020-12-28 17:55:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Learning:   Stay focused and use minimum viable technology to get started.   There was a huge learning curve with Mighty Networks and it cost me so much time.   Also, people care about the content, not how beautiful it is. I know this from my previous course.
1343616614370050055 2020-12-28 17:55:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. I'm overcomplicating it  Spent 17 hours this past week finalizing the agenda and getting some lessons completed.  Then, screwed up.   Switched from Google Slides to Mighty Networks, then back. TON of wasted time.  Shiny object syndrome is always my solopreneur Kryptonite.
1343616612931407879 2020-12-28 17:55:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What I learned this week:  1. Consistency is eerie  Knew LinkedIn would be my #1 channel but was surprised by consistency of the results WoW.  The % of total uniques to course page from LI deviated by &lt; 5%, and ratio of uniques to preorders was ~exactly the same. Eerily so.  https://t.co/0h8rhOBy78
1343616609722789888 2020-12-28 17:55:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> UPDATE: 11 days in...  - Sales: $22,672 - Hours spent creating: 23 - Hours spent promoting: 16 - Total hours: 39 - Revenue per hour of work: $581  https://t.co/DuFxZHsqAC
1343600968441749505 2020-12-28 16:53:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Exactly. I don't understand the mentality of hoarding your best stuff. Share freely and openly. People will still want to buy what you're building.
1343596941809229826 2020-12-28 16:37:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Building online?  Here's what works:  - Work toward achieving something - Document the whole journey - Write about your progress - Tie it into a product - Share  What doesn't work?  - Worrying about "expertise" - Not sharing your journey - Never starting
1343525788726005760 2020-12-28 11:54:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @domm @businessbarista @Dmurr68 @mayagrosmn @APompliano @FrancisSuarez Appreciate that, Edward. Cheers man.
1343233532576067587 2020-12-27 16:33:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Demeaning the accomplishments of others is a sure sign of having few of your own.
1343170817019015169 2020-12-27 12:24:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shawnkwekco @sughanthans1 @arvidkahl Appreciate that, Shawn. Happy holidays!
1342975639062786048 2020-12-26 23:28:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Ever.

1342967254351228929 2020-12-26 22:55:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Consistency and patience are two great moats.
1342966840293789697 2020-12-26 22:53:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Was just talking about this. Maybe even 2 years...
1342964937023483907 2020-12-26 22:46:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @david_perell Feel like @fast nailed this.
1342632192074280960 2020-12-26 00:43:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amillennialmuse @austin_rief I second this. I don’t know that I’ve ever sobbed after finishing a book.
1342625796201074689 2020-12-26 00:18:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bzaidi Also, Happiest Season was fun.
1342625436703059970 2020-12-26 00:17:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bzaidi Die Hard?
1342549172914892803 2020-12-25 19:14:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Merry Christmas from a very sad &amp; devastated Nashville.

1342280260222595072 2020-12-25 01:25:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjkmccaffrey Thanks, Chad. Excited to share. Happy holidays man!
1342192455345647616 2020-12-24 19:36:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SonomaKitsune Love the fox. Handsome devil.
1342191414277525505 2020-12-24 19:32:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThisIsParsons So dope. So happy to have it.
1342191369159389184 2020-12-24 19:32:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelwolber Thanks, Mike. I’m loving it.
1342191321428193284 2020-12-24 19:32:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattboneal It is, just gotta cobble it together 😃

1341935546290106374 2020-12-24 02:35:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmandaMGoetz Have you used Redfin?   Not in as many cities, but...wow...the user experience is just delightful.
1341836633767882752 2020-12-23 20:02:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KaranNL @Ali_Merchant @hypefury @jackbutcher I like it so far. Makes my life easier.
1341836551291072513 2020-12-23 20:02:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonriedel awesome. Thanks Jason! Cheers.
1341813603352121344 2020-12-23 18:31:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Chad4short On the docket!
1341798962584576001 2020-12-23 17:32:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @snholli My rules are basically to ask whether doing something will have a meaningful impact on someone while asking if the effort or monetary give will have little impact on my life. If it’s meaningful to someone and relatively meaningless (in the long run) to me, I do it.
1341798518760083456 2020-12-23 17:31:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickB2005 I will likely never go back to working for someone else. It’s not the life I want to design for myself and my family.
1341553530876911618 2020-12-23 01:17:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JillGoldworn Continued success to you, Jill. Beautiful name - my mother’s name.   Happy holidays.
1341553147110694913 2020-12-23 01:16:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pereusfrance Thanks, Ryan. Simple but def not easy. Feel like 2021 is a recovery year for everyone. Let’s be supportive.
1341552554359070725 2020-12-23 01:13:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GabrielaBrownFL Thank you, Gabriela. Too much hate. Not enough love.
1341551642286710784 2020-12-23 01:10:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM Much appreciated Mike. Just put good vibes into the universe.
1341550674862075907 2020-12-23 01:06:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM I’m just locked in on love. People have different opinions. I’m trying to understand.
1341550027051839488 2020-12-23 01:03:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Thank you, my friend.
1341543473242095616 2020-12-23 00:37:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf You’re an authentic guy, Steve. Appreciate the time you’ve taken to give guidance via email.   Cheers and happy holiday.
1341421666438660108 2020-12-22 16:33:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst @cartainc @pipe Congratulations, Harry. Huge.
1341421541964263424 2020-12-22 16:33:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iamrockyclark Every person that is successful has a common trait: consistency.
1341419833712406528 2020-12-22 16:26:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal It's a game of endurance...those who have it generally win in the end.
1341419744331780100 2020-12-22 16:26:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Love both of these, Brian.
1341418589115576321 2020-12-22 16:21:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You beat a competitor every day that you stay in the game.  Be the last person standing.
1341173138839756800 2020-12-22 00:06:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tonystark2020s Even better, put 99% of sales books back on the shelf.  Go study people and psychology.
1341172930248634372 2020-12-22 00:05:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake At least I know what it's supposed to be.  I can just use my imagination.
1341172553293946880 2020-12-22 00:03:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake I think it looks really good. Niche'd down a bit.  Your Presubscribe page has a broken image though.  https://t.co/To2WjFbM24
1341076829512347648 2020-12-21 17:43:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HMoosavian @jess_archives It's true. Learning to persuade and sell opens up a world of possibilities.
1341076725774635008 2020-12-21 17:43:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Such a powerful lever.  Learn to be incredibly persuasive and you can do nearly anything.
1341061470340182017 2020-12-21 16:42:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KishlayRAJindia It does.
1341060712672747520 2020-12-21 16:39:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pattimmons_ Thanks, Pat! Appreciate that.
1341060193405325312 2020-12-21 16:37:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The world rewards those who understand people &amp; psychology.
1341053828054061057 2020-12-21 16:12:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Thanks, Ali! Appreciate you reading it. Was a lot to compile.
1341026650562195458 2020-12-21 14:24:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> LAUNCH UPDATE:  After 4 days, the course launch has been really fun &amp; successful.  → Sales: $16,237 → Hours spent creating: 8 → Hours spent promoting: 14 → Total hours: 22 → Revenue per hour of work: $738  A more in-depth breakdown here:  https://t.co/npzHqUj2RG
1340819325196906504 2020-12-21 00:40:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau @KaranNL I’m just thinking about comments I get on content.   People work so hard to tell why something can’t be done.   I’m all about why it can.
1340818516853796864 2020-12-21 00:37:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KaranNL @fbourdeau It's a growth mindset vs. a stagnant mindset.
1340818097612140544 2020-12-21 00:35:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau It’s amazing how many people spend their time pointedly breaking down why something can’t be accomplished.
1340817263872651266 2020-12-21 00:32:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 99% of people: “Yeah, but...”  1% of people: “What if...”  Rewire your mind.
1340815924472008705 2020-12-21 00:26:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst This was my 2020 discovery.   Life has never been better.
1340773017006333952 2020-12-20 21:36:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattdanna Appreciate that, Matt. This has been a big undertaking! Excited to see it all come together though...cheers man.
1340698480239587330 2020-12-20 16:40:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake I had a launch day for my new project on Thursday with a distribution plan.   I didn’t prioritIze my time effectively, got a last minute client request, and only launched in 3 of 8 places I was hoping to.   So I just told everyone about it and got some feedback.
1340698044430430210 2020-12-20 16:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Yep. When you fail publicly or admit your failures in public it causes accelerated learning.   People come to you. They help. It’s a very supportive community.
1340696813813305346 2020-12-20 16:33:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Publicly admitting your mistakes is uncomfortable.  But, it's a helluva personal growth shortcut.
1340342206612254722 2020-12-19 17:04:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone is looking for a shortcut, so the short game is fierce.  Playing the long game is significantly less crowded.
1340088744796442625 2020-12-19 00:17:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @levelsio Oh cool - just saw the original person who asked this question...   https://t.co/u91wNyKsca is the jam. Bought it a few months back and ripped through it in a day.   10 out of 10. Highly recommend. Cheers.
1340085211674112000 2020-12-19 00:03:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LenaSesardic @thepatwalls Amazing. Thank you so much for your support, Lena. The build has been a lot of fun so far, and I'm prepared to deliver a tremendous amount of value. Glad to have you on board! 🙏🏻
1340077753140469760 2020-12-18 23:33:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @levelsio Thanks, my man. 💪🏻
1340066996101234690 2020-12-18 22:50:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmandaMGoetz @house__of__wise Been following your journey here and it’s so great to see these going out.   Keep up the great work! Going to grab some for my wife. 💪🏻
1340065254252941314 2020-12-18 22:43:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JuiceboxCA Such a testament to the power of doing, saying, and creating interesting things online.
1339979850971553798 2020-12-18 17:04:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> UPDATE: Spent 3 hours this AM brain dumping.  Got everything I could think of on paper and then organized.  Ended w/ 5 Parts:  - Mindset - Idea - Audience - Proof - Product  Broken into 2 Chapters:  - Principles - Tactics  Each w/ multiple lessons.   49 lessons in total so far.  https://t.co/XyYlrkDNNP
1339750828400381953 2020-12-18 01:54:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austin_rief Do both well and compound interest becomes significantly more interesting.
1339742172594237441 2020-12-18 01:19:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis Add value, be humble, be unique and you’ll have incredible success and amazing, close friends.
1339741054124363776 2020-12-18 01:15:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Awesome.  Looking fwd to seeing what you’re putting out Blake.
1339735981612818439 2020-12-18 00:55:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo This very specific point is what’s most important to me about selling.   I purchase things from people I trust and admire because of their unique perspective.   I never, ever purchase because I was “nurtured” or on a “drip”.   So I never do those things.
1339721776981524480 2020-12-17 23:58:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau @KaranNL Thank you so much fellas! 🙌🏻
1339709971638960128 2020-12-17 23:12:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KaranNL Thanks so much for your incredible support, Karan. I appreciate it so much.
1339646230452969479 2020-12-17 18:58:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Outside of that, the course launch is going well. Now it's time to get down to business.  A special shout out to @jackbutcher whom I had the pleasure of grabbing some coffee with. His Build Once, Sell Twice course was a massive help. Kudos.
1339646229337296896 2020-12-17 18:58:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> - A friend pointed out this very thread doesn't talk much about the course contents until you get deep into the thread. I could have done a better job.  - I didn't set up Google Analytics properly so I don't have great tracking. Smh.
1339646228133502976 2020-12-17 18:58:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I also made some mistakes:  - I used 2 CTAs on my landing page prompting some users to get confused. Silly mistake... - Wasn't able to share on Indie Hackers &amp; Reddit bc I just didn't manage my time well.  More...↓
1339646227047198722 2020-12-17 18:58:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What went well:  - LinkedIn post hit 59k impressions - My email list purchased $3,962 - My LI audience purchased $5,906 - Gumroad sold $149 - The comments are jammed full of people who loved my last course  But...↓
1339646225654681605 2020-12-17 18:58:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> UPDATE: It took 5 hours &amp; 58 minutes, but I just met my Day 1 presale goal of $10k  The outpouring of support from the LinkedIn &amp; Twitter community has been overwhelming. There are a lot of kind hearts out there.  Here are some things that went well and some things that didn't↓
1339611643819552769 2020-12-17 16:41:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Speaking my language.
1339587399068729347 2020-12-17 15:04:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Love this. I write content to myself basically.
1339586042920194049 2020-12-17 14:59:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kenfitzg Hmm. Should have come directly from Gumroad.  Want to shoot me your email address to justinwelsh@hey.com ?   I'll make sure I received it on my end, Ken.
1339585434037276672 2020-12-17 14:57:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TommyTahoe Here we go, Tom! Looking fwd to going on the journey together.
1339583337833250826 2020-12-17 14:48:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jeff_Breunsbach @thepatwalls @jaynathan Awesome. I literally plan on documenting everything. Hope it's helpful.
1339580273256763393 2020-12-17 14:36:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bausbrooks_ Amazing. So happy to have you on board, Brandon. Appreciate your support. 🙏🏻
1339577185783459841 2020-12-17 14:24:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant @thepatwalls Amazing, Ali. Thank you for your support. I appreciate it so much. Excited for this next journey.
1339572393933729792 2020-12-17 14:05:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Amazing, Jason. Thank you for your support. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
1339572021466968074 2020-12-17 14:03:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> But, ultimately, I landed on a digital course.   If you want to follow along, come join me.   https://t.co/GOmWBLygMj  I'm going to build it right here in public and will be continuously adding to this thread. Thanks for following along.
1339572017360723968 2020-12-17 14:03:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I kicked around a bunch of ideas from opening a paid community, to doing cohort-based coaching workshops, to writing a newsletter. In the end, I decided to go with a digital course that’s short and doesn't contain a lot of fluff. Just principles and tactics.
1339571980304064515 2020-12-17 14:03:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3. I don’t see much tactical advice for establishing your idea, growing your audience, and making sales online.   And I certainly don’t see anyone making this kind of information affordable.
1339571942425288710 2020-12-17 14:03:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2. Unfortunately, most of what I see online are “get rich quick” schemes with guys sitting on rented private planes trying to convince you to spend $1,500. It's ridiculous.
1339571938570739712 2020-12-17 14:03:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I decided to build this for 3 reasons:  1. 2020 has wreaked havoc on people’s lives. Millions of people have lost jobs, and having a second stream of income is more critical than ever.
1339571935156559872 2020-12-17 14:03:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I never really promoted my first course. Still made $78k.  Helped 1,500 people!  So, I've really wanted to create a 2nd one.  It's called:   Idea.Audience.Proof.Product.  It's everything I learned about planning and building online in 27 months, distilled down into one course.
1339571932908445697 2020-12-17 14:03:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> That was 15 months ago. Here are the results of building my own thing online:  - Audience: 70,000 (mostly LinkedIn) - Newsletter: 45,000 - Revenue: $667,884 - Revenue streams: 3 (advising, coaching, digital product)  Advising: $430k Coaching: $160k Product: $78k
1339571930127605762 2020-12-17 14:03:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I spent those 12 months building an audience on social media (mostly LinkedIn).   Once I had built some interest online and had some prospects asking about some advisory work, I decided to step away from my role.
1339571927934001159 2020-12-17 14:03:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Quick backstory:  I was an executive at a startup in LA that I had helped build from $0 to $30M in ARR in 3 years. In 2018, I started to burn out.  So, I put a 12-month plan in place to leave my executive role in September of 2018.
1339571923102121984 2020-12-17 14:03:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Inspired by @thepatwalls, I'm taking action.  I'm creating my 2nd course over the next 30 days.  Instead of building in private, I'll document the entire process here.  Actual revenue numbers, effort, wins, &amp; mistakes.  The course:  https://t.co/GOmWBLygMj  Follow along 👇🏻
1339254308756393986 2020-12-16 17:01:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson True story.
1339247736957394944 2020-12-16 16:35:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Anyone who is naturally risk-averse should have a side hustle.   Or two.
1339226619718864905 2020-12-16 15:11:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat That's really interesting, thanks, Brian. It's a world I'm not well versed in.   Considering picking up some BTC. Any thoughts?
1339219640778706946 2020-12-16 14:43:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thepatwalls @Ali_Merchant Started as a member at StarterStory, then saw your course launch in public. Inspired me to do the same (again).   Thanks for the motivation 💪🏻
1339218176333275140 2020-12-16 14:37:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant Was inspired by @thepatwalls timeboxing and building a course in public.   I did it last year, just needed to be reminded to take action.
1339214063830765568 2020-12-16 14:21:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> After tinkering around with an idea for months, I decided to just take some action.   Accomplished more in 2 focused hours than in 30 days of wondering.   Reminder to self: Just. Get. Started.
1338994269571395586 2020-12-15 23:48:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonfried Makes sense. Appreciate it.
1338982066168455168 2020-12-15 22:59:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonfried Awesome. Can’t wait to get my business email on this.   Any intention to build in templates in the future?
1338899433036132353 2020-12-15 17:31:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @connorcirillo @aarcunning Really cool. I’ll have to check this out. Thanks for sharing.
1338560163175915520 2020-12-14 19:03:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyledackerman @erikbison Thanks, fellas. I think Twitter is all about deeper relationships which, for me, means more interesting partnerships, work, friends, etc.   I love LinkedIn. I've met wonderful people and stood my business up on the platform. But, I'm interested in checking out other options.
1338559832635355148 2020-12-14 19:01:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW Here's hoping! Thanks for all of your great content. Been really excellent to observe how people create value here.
1338544013675204615 2020-12-14 17:58:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake @fbourdeau @LinkedIn Well, shit. That makes me feel good.
1338543336764960770 2020-12-14 17:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau @uxblake @LinkedIn Thanks, fellas. Trying my damndest.
1338543207072854022 2020-12-14 17:55:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NickB2005 @uxblake Glad it's helpful, Nick.   All in all, the takeaway is to create stuff that is interesting and to be consistent. Much like most platforms, ya know?
1338542800133099520 2020-12-14 17:54:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake You know what you're doing, man.  Your Tweets, websites, products. All are very well crafted. Really impressed.
1338541634389221376 2020-12-14 17:49:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It was the first time I had very meaningful engagement (for me):  - 36,333 impressions - 1,200+ engagements.   I didn’t even think the Tweet was very good.  Anyways, thought these could be helpful lessons for anyone looking to grow and enjoy this platform. Cheers.  https://t.co/Ryf3stLRle
1338541619675607041 2020-12-14 17:49:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Then, I read a Tweet by @AlexLlullTW  that reminded me to repurpose content from other channels that had performed well.  I took a popular LinkedIn post, reformatted it for Twitter, and posted it yesterday.  https://t.co/OKFRfCYoae
1338541585013805057 2020-12-14 17:49:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Next, I started crafting my own content that I thought was either:  - Interesting - Informative - Entertaining - Helpful  Some were duds.  Many got better engagement than I thought.
1338541582883184643 2020-12-14 17:49:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Then, I started observing other people that had smaller followings (under 10kish) but have great engagement.   I simply observed. What made their content good?  A perfect example is @uxblake  He does a great job putting tweets together and engaging his audience.
1338541579926183939 2020-12-14 17:49:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I started by being an active participant in more conversations here.  This is a BIG difference between the two platforms.  LinkedIn: Post + sit back Twitter: Post + engage in deeper, more meaningful conversations.
1338541577376034818 2020-12-14 17:49:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I grew my audience on LinkedIn to over 63k followers.  Then I tried Twitter. It’s definitely more difficult.  But recently, I got some traction.  Here are 4  things that helped  ⬇️  https://t.co/pn3g694kWD
1338534616689471488 2020-12-14 17:21:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM That's what I'm hoping we get to. Would be nice to see businesses built by more part-timers with specific skills i.e. I help with distribution at 4 companies simultaneously, all underneath my own brand while the other employees are all doing the same.
1338523467210166277 2020-12-14 16:37:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The present:  - Get a job. - Work their schedule. - Make a major impact. - Take home 10% to 15% of that.  The future:  - Create your job. - Work your own schedule. - Make a major impact. - Take home 100% of that.
1338180073556488193 2020-12-13 17:52:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jadesai94 Definitely. Motivators, IMO, are successful at motivating. Hence, I believe they fit the definition. Success is very subjective and I didn't necessarily mean monetary success.
1338171494082506759 2020-12-13 17:18:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadtshth Definitely. With friends, IMO, it's about leveling up while also finding those who suck energy away and pulling away.
1338162880768847874 2020-12-13 16:44:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @APompliano There's a lot out there for all of us.  Most people consume and never consistently execute.   The abundance only reaches you when you take action.
1338161147816665091 2020-12-13 16:37:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau The ease is on the backend when your life becomes easier, though.
1338160087777546240 2020-12-13 16:33:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've never met a successful person surrounded by unsuccessful people.  Audit your environment.
1337905774429921281 2020-12-12 23:42:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @corprteUnicorn @chancetherapper I love Christmas music but this in an excellent addition. What a great first song. Listening to the rest now.

1337831892310237188 2020-12-12 18:49:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bzaidi Chubby711 (I was a chubby teen and born July 11th)
1337793447131041792 2020-12-12 16:16:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort For a long time I looked up to people who used words that I had to look up in the dictionary.   I thought I must be so unintelligent.   Then I thought...”Shouldn’t they do a better job communicating?”  The answer is yes.
1337786871804530688 2020-12-12 15:50:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The golden rule of intellect:  More jargon means less competence.  Make difficult things simple.  Not the other way around.
1337570435328827393 2020-12-12 01:30:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abarrallen @dofornop @fast @domm As a Clevelander and Buckeye...I support this.
1337433206170284035 2020-12-11 16:24:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KaranNL Yeah, I'm enjoying it so far for sure. Testing out how effective it is, and what it's capabilities are.
1337432878033104901 2020-12-11 16:23:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Produce such incredible results that nobody cares about hours or effort.
1337152233381785603 2020-12-10 21:48:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tyleramarcus I love that. May steal. Thanks!
1337152127735652355 2020-12-10 21:48:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @rohangilkes @jmcmillen89 @jackbutcher @RobbieCrab @izzydoesizzy @martyrdison Thanks, Brian. Appreciate being included with such wonderful people. Cheers.
1337076736002023424 2020-12-10 16:48:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @kylewill Interesting. This happens by accident in our house because our favorite local cheap eats is a vegan place.
1337074923748126723 2020-12-10 16:41:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs Same here. 8:30a to 10:15a each morning I walk 6 miles with my wife. No meetings.
1337071698059915266 2020-12-10 16:28:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Eliminating meetings on Monday and Friday has changed my life.  Creativity up. Stress down.
1337042441673846786 2020-12-10 14:32:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pradologue How you communicate.
1336720965976338433 2020-12-09 17:14:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kbdotfyi @paulsalamanca "Not ugly or a piece of shit" - Kyle Baldinger on Justin Welsh  This is my best testimonial! :)
1336679186883354625 2020-12-09 14:28:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JanelSGM This resonates.  10% of people will simply dislike what you do no matter what it is.  Even when you put something awesome into the world (which Newsletter OS is), a small portion of people want to drag you down.  It's them. Not you.
1336400133211234306 2020-12-08 19:59:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @AlexLlullTW 😂
1336397897743691777 2020-12-08 19:51:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlexLlullTW @BGroat Alex, feel free to grab it and if you don't like it, I'll refund you 110%, no questions asked. Cheers.
1336389024861331458 2020-12-08 19:15:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattladydigital Glad it was helpful, Matt. That's awesome.   Writing daily starts out and feels like the first time you exercise.   I look back at my writing from 18 months ago and I'm shocked at how much I've improved.   I'm sure you'll experience the same.
1336339074819317763 2020-12-08 15:57:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Consistency is a moat, especially in self-employment.  Whatever you're working on, get some part of it out there daily.
1336104430597500930 2020-12-08 00:24:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HackItMax So in.
1336089058641055744 2020-12-07 23:23:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Love that term, Scott. Thanks for sharing that.
1336010773248815109 2020-12-07 18:12:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson Thanks, Yancey. Truly appreciate that kind compliment.
1335987312476499969 2020-12-07 16:39:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat It's a great strategy. It requires patience and a focus on long game vs short game mentality. It wins in the end.
1335985780561424384 2020-12-07 16:33:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Promoting others can be a great form of self-promotion.
1335932953713635333 2020-12-07 13:03:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake I've found serving a micro-niche here can be helpful:  - Sales - SaaS sales - SMB SaaS sales - Early-stage SMB SaaS sales - Early-stage SMB SaaS sales in the healthcare technology vertical 👈🏻 Where I deliver results...
1335655624655450115 2020-12-06 18:41:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tonystark2020s Do interesting things. Tell people about them.
1335620375103856640 2020-12-06 16:21:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal @aadtshth I hope so. Excited to share it.
1335619123313860614 2020-12-06 16:16:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aadtshth Yep. Just about to release something new in public here soon. Hoping it resonates with folks.
1335618687601172484 2020-12-06 16:14:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePhillyResume Touché
1335617821800361988 2020-12-06 16:11:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ThePhillyResume Definitely. Everything in moderation...
1335613290383335428 2020-12-06 15:53:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The best way to be interesting online is to be interesting offline.
1335373440312807424 2020-12-06 00:00:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffreymack Hey there.
1335255660288684033 2020-12-05 16:12:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KaranNL Thanks, Karan. Really appreciate that man.

1334656308843311105 2020-12-04 00:30:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @d_tao Negroni with Naval.
1334638864695242760 2020-12-03 23:21:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randfish When you think about creating this way, it's basically a natural funnel.   Step 1: Make people successful Step 2: Build relationships Step 3: Create customers  Most people want a shortcut to step 3.   Long-game is how you're thinking.

1334501877820633088 2020-12-03 14:16:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Funny that it usually comes from someone other than ourselves.
1334501580381548550 2020-12-03 14:15:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KevinEkmark If you make a 10% better impact on a $10M company....you're not a $250/hr person.   Ya know?
1334500274904424448 2020-12-03 14:10:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You're worth more than you're charging.  ⛔️  Don't do hourly math. ✅  Do outcomes math.  If you're uncomfortable, find someone to push you.  For me? My wife.   She's the driver behind an 8x increase.  https://t.co/Krz6NlI5L8

1334292616108773377 2020-12-03 00:25:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @corprteUnicorn I’d start with  https://t.co/P2WmembyAH from @levelsio   Great foundation for getting started if you don't code IMO.
1334289975437832195 2020-12-03 00:14:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @corprteUnicorn You looking to build website or software product/app?

1334110645378310146 2020-12-02 12:22:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy 100%   I cut news out last year. Huge lift in positivity and creative output.
1333956976854896643 2020-12-02 02:11:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake I’m glad it helped kick start what you’re doing now. LinkedIn/Twitter/YouTube doesn’t matter.   Just producing, adding value, etc.  High level it’s all similar even given the granular differences
1333955864139620355 2020-12-02 02:07:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Thanks, my man. I’m right back atcha re: Twitter 💪🏻

1333945681111879680 2020-12-02 01:26:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @onebrightblake Let’s connect soon. I’ll help you get that first dollar. It unlocks everything. Deal?
1333920592626659330 2020-12-01 23:47:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randfish I'm committed to shopping small this holiday season.   I have 5 things from your list ready to go for my family, Rand.   This is such a great guide. Thanks for putting it together.
1333914810388537347 2020-12-01 23:24:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheErnestOwusu So true, my man.
1333914766818074626 2020-12-01 23:23:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KevinEkmark Definitely.
1333914719581859840 2020-12-01 23:23:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth I can promise you it’s true. Ha.
1333914671762518018 2020-12-01 23:23:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis Depends on if it’s sustainable!
1333914605459009536 2020-12-01 23:23:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shanta_adhi You can’t go backwards after this.
1333905213258821632 2020-12-01 22:46:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The first time you make $1,000 in one day online will be the last day you think about working for someone else.
1333847069937774592 2020-12-01 18:54:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @yenFTW @bentossell @_its_greg @zapier @stripe @makerpad I'm just consuming everything right now. Really good stuff.   Gonna grab a yearly pass for sure.
1333842754032594944 2020-12-01 18:37:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_its_greg @zapier @stripe @makerpad Welp. I've been on Makerpad for about 15 minutes and I'm effing hooked. Can't get enough of these deep dives.  Good work, @bentossell.   Thanks for the distraction, Greg 😂
1333836366162120706 2020-12-01 18:12:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_its_greg @zapier @stripe @makerpad I haven't spent much time there yet, no. Will do some digging this weekend. Thanks, Greg!
1333809312146333697 2020-12-01 16:24:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @zapier @stripe Saves me so much time.
1333779742038908928 2020-12-01 14:27:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjkmccaffrey @zapier @stripe Thanks, Chad. Hope this is helpful for some folks.
1333778667361742848 2020-12-01 14:23:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Customers sign up &amp; the flow begins.  I get paid, they get email with GDrive folder, 1:1 agenda document, and the details they need to schedule meetings and contact me.  Then, Stripe bills them every 30 days.  Hope this helps.  email me at justinwelsh@hey.com with any questions.
1333778660793475074 2020-12-01 14:23:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 3: Add agenda document to GDrive Folder I just set up.  Action event = create document from template (I store my 1:1 doc as a template)  Template document = 1:1 template  Folder = the folder created in step 2  Sharing preference = anyone with link can edit  https://t.co/vpcIsbWtaY
1333778655441543173 2020-12-01 14:23:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Step 2: Setup GDrive  Action event = create folder in GDrive  Folder name = email address of the subscriber (weird, but works)  I nest it under a parent folder I already have created called "Advising clients"  https://t.co/2BuOU5wPKs
1333778649846140930 2020-12-01 14:23:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 steps to automating my client onboarding via @zapier .  Step 1: Setup @stripe   Trigger event = new event in Stripe.  Event type = new customer subscription signup.  Note: This action begins on my website, which allows customers to sign up for my subscription advisory service.  https://t.co/Uf5gdLe8D2
1333426370991579139 2020-11-30 15:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM It's hard to stop consuming.   But that 57th blog post doesn't have the secret answer...
1333424128020393987 2020-11-30 14:54:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant @MCellarsOhio I've found that having a redirect i.e. "I can't do that, but here's a page where I share information about that topic" has been helpful for me as well.
1333415431193980930 2020-11-30 14:19:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ethanbeute Reading on the internet to learn can (sometimes) be a terrible idea, especially if it's a topic rife with SEO-driven listicles and other nonsense.  I've found creating unlocks learning much faster.
1333410928600227840 2020-11-30 14:01:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ali_Merchant It's a skill I work on every single day. It has been the most meaningful improvement I've made.
1333410211558780928 2020-11-30 13:59:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3 skills that lead to a more intentional life:  - Saying "no" politely but firmly. - Embracing difficult conversations. - Using creation to learn vs. consumption.  All 3 have no ceiling for improvement.
1333395119035342851 2020-11-30 12:59:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy Damn dude. Feel better, please.
1333058518669209600 2020-11-29 14:41:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TommyTahoe Congrats, Tom!
1332468507821436928 2020-11-27 23:37:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort I love this. It's eerie that each job I've taken at high-growth startups, I last 4.5 years. I can't do something for more than that period of time.   I feel understood!
1331738990098178056 2020-11-25 23:18:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake Oh, Christ. Mine too. It's nuts.  Twitter still feels like an exclusive club to some people (which, by the way, can be a good thing).  LinkedIn feels safe. A place meant to try and do business (hence the DMs).  If you can curate both effectively, you've won. I'm 1 for 2 :)
1331737957116555270 2020-11-25 23:14:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @uxblake I agree, but I think you're potentially overlooking some basic differences between the platforms that lead to that ratio.
1331704248900460549 2020-11-25 21:00:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NaithanJones Don’t pay the players.  Don’t let small business thrive.  Only big money college gets to benefit.  It’s gross.
1331637849322639362 2020-11-25 16:36:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn @jasonvana Going to be launching soon...
1331637348795355138 2020-11-25 16:34:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana I'm just happy to be able to edit my new Ghost theme.
1331635310061629440 2020-11-25 16:26:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> - Inspected a web page - Copied some code - Edited some HTML  I’m sure this is taught in kindergarten now, but here’s my face: 🤯
1330902191067066371 2020-11-23 15:53:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @madebyblack Think it's a throw-off. No way the kid did it!
1330856164914061312 2020-11-23 12:50:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @domm It's a psychological thriller involving some rich socialites in NYC. I won't say much more than that. The less you know, the better IMO.
1330713406442237956 2020-11-23 03:22:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst I’m so irritated I can’t binge it.   There are actually people who don’t enjoy it. I’d like to meet these folks.   What’s your best guess?
1330712884935057410 2020-11-23 03:20:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Is anyone else enjoying The Undoing on HBO as much as I am?
1330319099600236547 2020-11-22 01:16:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samfjacobs Best Coast is also killer if you like Cali surf punk. Wet is insane from BK
1330318892238073857 2020-11-22 01:15:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samfjacobs Nah. It’s on Boxer. Overrated IMO. Alligator is where it’s at.
1330318418675982337 2020-11-22 01:13:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samfjacobs Illmatic is a classic. Need to dive into others. You done Alligator by The National?
1330317678414802944 2020-11-22 01:10:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samfjacobs “Seem” is the word I have to use until I “know”.   Ok. Checking it out tonight.
1330316966356275201 2020-11-22 01:07:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samfjacobs Gimme your fave album, Sam. All-time. I need something new and you seem to have good taste.
1330314217757544448 2020-11-22 00:56:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach @abarrallen @IUBloomington As a huge OSU fan, I must admit...  They were significantly more challenging than I had anticipated.   Great to see the program moving in the right direction.   (But go bucks)

1330275763141160972 2020-11-21 22:23:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy Interesting. Not an ale guy? You have a go-to that’s not a 10.5% imperial stout?
1329964252141154307 2020-11-21 01:46:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM @mikewhitmore @uxblake There ya go. Cheers
1329951188398305281 2020-11-21 00:54:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_its_greg Same here. Have a north star.   This has been helpful to me...
1329946880999088128 2020-11-21 00:37:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_beaumont I don't, no.  I did the "hustle" thing for a long time, and I'm really glad I did, to be honest.   It taught me how to work hard, but also taught me the value of balance as I grew older.  I think the hustle culture is behind us now. It's no longer "cool" to work like a maniac.
1329917988963803137 2020-11-20 22:42:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjkmccaffrey No equity. Just cash for me.   As someone who makes his living this way I prefer cash, especially given I have a lot of equity in previous, still growing companies.
1329903112111403008 2020-11-20 21:43:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MikethePBM Yeah, I can appreciate that for sure. Ignoring that object in the moment is the challenging part.
1329902825783046145 2020-11-20 21:41:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BTrautschold Need focus goggles today...damn.
1329900072411258884 2020-11-20 21:31:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Shiny object syndrome is solopreneur kryptonite.
1329894755002617856 2020-11-20 21:09:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewkkirk My gut is that top companies of the future will:  - hire incredible talent from around the world  - use tech and tools to communicate and manage effectively  - give incredible autonomy to those they hire  Thoughts?
1329885519493390344 2020-11-20 20:33:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andrewkkirk Do you mean managing salespeople?
1329877767014453251 2020-11-20 20:02:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LukeWilliams712 Same here.   Given the average person only does about 4 hours of real work per day...  Why not make it the best 4 hours?
1329875842273599489 2020-11-20 19:54:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Woke up at 4am and did a 5-hour work sprint.  Now I'm done for the day.  Feels like non-timezone-dependent work should always operate this way.   What's the downside?
1329862396098322433 2020-11-20 19:01:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_beaumont @thealibilawal Was wide awake at 4am today. Leveraged that to work hard for 5 hours.   Now off the rest of the day. Schedule ebbs and flows which I enjoy.
1329427505472819201 2020-11-19 14:13:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_beaumont Great question. I am a one-man show.  I delegate using Fiverr. For example, I'm building a newsletter and I couldn't figure out how to code @Ghost so rather than spend time figuring it out, I paid a guy $10 and he did it perfectly.
1329402325350363136 2020-11-19 12:33:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonriedel Thanks for the follow, Jason. I appreciate that. Cheers, man.
1329220243806445576 2020-11-19 00:29:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat No, the LIP is a year old now.  If you want to check out the FAQ, here it is:   https://t.co/5RFyavlz2A
1329214064409587713 2020-11-19 00:05:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarryStebbings @alexisohanian @sevensevensix @joshelman @reidhoffman @drose_999 @Mazzeo Awesome. Can't wait for this one, Harry.
1329211685266202624 2020-11-18 23:55:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Mostly through blocks of creativity.   I'm most creative over coffee in the AM, so I stopped booking meetings in the morning.  Also, I might write 10 pieces of content in 2 hours and then write zero for a few days.   It's just listening to how I'm feeling.
1329209522108305409 2020-11-18 23:47:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 principles I revisit daily when building online:  - Remember to share the offline journey - Harness momentum. It's underrated. - Give 5x more than you ask - Creation &gt; consumption  These are constant reminders to myself.
1329199225276674057 2020-11-18 23:06:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @wilczynski24 I think it can work when starting out w/ lower rates &amp; disco charge. IMO if you target your ICP really well &amp; can articulate value on your website, you can do this at a micro-level.   Can also implement one step at a time. I didn't do this at the beginning. Worth testing?
1329176663322734592 2020-11-18 21:36:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Shakemktg It guarantees showing up and being invested in the time.
1329155077194604548 2020-11-18 20:10:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rahathasanc Appreciate that, Rahat.
1329142047786332163 2020-11-18 19:18:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tyleramarcus It's been such a winner for me.  I've also:  1. Used Zapier to automate my entire onboarding flow.  2. Automated LinkedIn DM ==&gt; Email ==&gt; landing pages.
1329139364107005958 2020-11-18 19:08:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana I don't, but I only charge $99. Small enough for any founder to pay but large enough to keep random people from booking.   I'm testing a new flow where I allow anyone to book but approve/decline after reviewing. You can see that here:   https://t.co/GAudbStrxZ
1329137218686955523 2020-11-18 18:59:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shanta_adhi Sure thing, Shanta.
1329136592791986176 2020-11-18 18:57:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shanta_adhi It depends on how time-sensitive you are today. If you have an empty calendar and talking to more prospects means more business, then maybe you gate it.  If talking to a poor-fit prospect is detrimental to your schedule, then I advise putting it out there.
1329134024632176640 2020-11-18 18:47:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How I stopped wasting time on poor-fit prospects for my consulting business:  → Made my pricing transparent → Provided a robust FAQ document → Charge $$ for 30-minute discovery calls  Volume ⬇️  Show rate ⬆️ Win rate ⬆️  ACV ⬆️
1328882839799128064 2020-11-18 02:08:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson Have you looked at Zapier free plan plus some lost cost tools?
1328866664591618051 2020-11-18 01:04:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese I built a brand new flow that's gorgeous.  1. Away message on LinkedIn that directs to email 2. Away message on email that directs to paid consults  Zero access.
1328859657226637313 2020-11-18 00:36:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @meccalauren If it feels wrong, it likely is. Trust your gut.
1328847757948424192 2020-11-17 23:49:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana It's probably the #1 lesson I've learned.   Second best is #4
1328838797459644416 2020-11-17 23:13:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4 hard lessons from 15 months of self-employment:  - If you're unsure, say no - Eliminate / automate / delegate - Share results in public → gain attention - Chase short-term $ and you'll miss long-term $$$
1328821459641393161 2020-11-17 22:04:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Now I gotta return your 2nd bottle.
1328810583035097088 2020-11-17 21:21:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana I thought I was just on LinkedIn and I was on Twitter. No joke.
1328810178565840896 2020-11-17 21:20:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Sometimes I don't even know what app I'm on anymore.
1328806033549111297 2020-11-17 21:03:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese You're welcome.
1328697974696841219 2020-11-17 13:54:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dhh I often find that the young admire this type of nonsense so they strive to duplicate it.  Fast forward a decade or two, and it's:  → Unsustainable → Anxiety-inducing → Relationship destroying  This is the definition of shitty advice.   Take it from someone who has been there.
1328453456227659776 2020-11-16 21:42:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ryan___Doyle @theandreboso @zerotomarketing This is excellent stuff, Ryan.   Going to read through my pages with a different eye tonight.   Thanks for sharing.
1328436311242498048 2020-11-16 20:34:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJonFedor @markymetry Yes. Take sales automation tools.  Everyone is looking for instructions on writing the best cold email. It doesn't matter.  Learn the principles of prospecting.   I could outperform 99% of SDRs with just a phone and an excel sheet of emails.
1328427411734716416 2020-11-16 19:59:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markymetry Yes, instructions can be helpful. Want to be great at something? Principles.  Example: Always following a recipe will never make you a great chef. You must understand fundamental principles of cooking.   Once you do, instructions become less important.
1328426200994344964 2020-11-16 19:54:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone wants instructions.  Everyone needs principles.  Principles &gt; Instructions.
1328084272872370177 2020-11-15 21:15:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs I’m just getting started.  Can’t wait to sit down and map out more.
1328042856624361473 2020-11-15 18:31:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ribeezie @gill_works Awesome. Just purchased. Thanks!
1328017238801190912 2020-11-15 16:49:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ribeezie That would be awesome and much appreciated.
1328017020491866116 2020-11-15 16:48:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shanta_adhi I’ve known about it forever but never really spent the time to use it. I’m a noob but enjoying learning.
1328016876128133126 2020-11-15 16:47:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Ribeezie I’m just getting into it and recognizing so many opps.   I plan on diving into it even more in the upcoming months.
1328015907503939586 2020-11-15 16:44:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjkmccaffrey I'm going to write up a short article on how I built if, if that would be helpful? It took some time and made some mistakes, so maybe it would be beneficial to others.
1328015690469691392 2020-11-15 16:43:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Advisory work is my fundamental work, so I do spend time on it.  I've automated my retainer into a Stripe subscription. I use that subscription to auto-create a Google Folder then agenda doc, then auto-email them that info.  I used to do this all manually.
1328015054399283201 2020-11-15 16:40:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjkmccaffrey I'm a total novice, so this is me starting to chip away at manual processes via Zaps.
1328014858483326977 2020-11-15 16:39:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjkmccaffrey I built:  Stripe Subscription → GDrive Folder creation → Google Doc Agenda creation → automated email with all of that info + more.
1328014613905018887 2020-11-15 16:38:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat You mean the workflow I built?
1328013808376418309 2020-11-15 16:35:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Zapier blows my mind.  Just created a 4-step automation for onboarding new consulting clients.   Saving so much time.

1327407800536993792 2020-11-14 00:27:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MCellarsOhio Stuffed from lunch.   🍷 for dinner.
1327405597889884160 2020-11-14 00:18:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoePompliano @atbwebb Damn. This was a great read.   Thanks for the excellent thread, Joe.
1327404923114430466 2020-11-14 00:16:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @erikbison Beautiful job lighting that. A pro!
1327392537464729601 2020-11-13 23:26:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @erikbison Thanks, man.   Here’s my process:   1. Buy kindling and starter logs at Home Depot.   2. Light.   🔥🔥
1327390039840591873 2020-11-13 23:17:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Nashville evenings...🔥  https://t.co/v5VU13vUhs
1327290206555430913 2020-11-13 16:40:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst For me, it was proving previous employers wrong. A bit cliché, but that was all of the motivation I really needed.
1327070940006649859 2020-11-13 02:09:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaganbiyani Been working on launching a cohort-based coaching program for 6 months.   Then I saw your announcement.   Hurry up! I want this. Best of luck, Gagan.
1326884627559165956 2020-11-12 13:48:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo A common phrase I hear is:  "I need to make X to afford my lifestyle".   I've found it easier to simply change my lifestyle.
1326694422629785600 2020-11-12 01:12:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HackItMax I feel you. Unloading the dishwasher is like Ringling Bros for me. How many coffee cups can I carry at once?
1326686400205484033 2020-11-12 00:41:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Branden_EnotO @podstarter @domm @fast Maybe. I'm just guessing, remember? :)
1326685395304796161 2020-11-12 00:37:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Branden_EnotO @podstarter @domm @fast I agree with some of your assessments, but what landing page doesn't talk about increased conversion?   A stroke of different in a sea of sameness.
1326666114445824001 2020-11-11 23:20:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @domm @fast The one on the right. Tells the "how" behind the conversion.
1325876092243238912 2020-11-09 19:01:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markymetry How am I future-proofing my life?
1325853326337040384 2020-11-09 17:30:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland With. More human IMO
1325847626173046784 2020-11-09 17:08:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram Happy bday bud. Hope it’s a great one. 🙌🏻
1325266422407311361 2020-11-08 02:38:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samfjacobs Not one bit. 👏
1325262329999659008 2020-11-08 02:22:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Got me jazzed as hell.
1325260354952306688 2020-11-08 02:14:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @samfjacobs Ladies and gentlemen...Sam Jacobs.
1325256400507981824 2020-11-08 01:58:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJackieHermes She was excellent. She brought tears to my eyes and my wife’s eyes. But she’s always excellent.  Biden just took it up 10 notches.
1325255932226441216 2020-11-08 01:56:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jimmydouglas Wow. That was intense.   And also completely coherent which is so refreshing.  I’m ready to put on a helmet.   Go Joe!
1325254104508231680 2020-11-08 01:49:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @M_Gagliano This is the best I’ve seen him in a long time.   I’m pumped just watching.
1325253516504469505 2020-11-08 01:47:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @annaelwood I think he snuck in a few one-armed push-ups.
1325207122850799616 2020-11-07 22:42:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @visualizevalue @jackbutcher One of my favorites, both in terms of the message and the visual.   Nice work on this one, Jack.
1325147363564900352 2020-11-07 18:45:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @msuster That sparks joy. ✨
1324918481658261507 2020-11-07 03:35:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto Amazing! Thanks, Aaron. My wife, Jennifer, will love it for her bday. Cheers, my man.   Enjoying following you inside VV.
1324914531957690373 2020-11-07 03:20:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @aaraalto  https://t.co/vbve6Pmnzt
1324878758692708352 2020-11-07 00:58:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @mijustin Either way..appreciate the reply and the viewpoint. Cheers, Daniel.
1324878669815422977 2020-11-07 00:57:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @mijustin I think vocal supporters om either side tend to be most difficult to understand bc, by nature, the more vocal, the more likely they only understand their candidate (painting with a broad brush here though)  It's the vocalness of the 2 candidates that makes me struggle for Trump.
1324864389355278337 2020-11-07 00:00:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @mijustin I'm curious (in a truly curious way i.e., not baiting here) what part of Biden's world do you believe makes no sense to them?
1324757600144101376 2020-11-06 16:56:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BreakItStruan @mkobach I think so.  Figuring out the best way to do that is the challenging part.   As Matt has suggested here, it needs to start with education from an early level.
1324756845286838273 2020-11-06 16:53:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BreakItStruan @mkobach Might be misreading what I meant there.  Both statements could be baseless or accurate. The substance behind them makes them so.  For example, if you hear "many people are saying it" it could be true if, in fact, many people are. If not, it's just rubbish.  The substance is key.
1324755689609269248 2020-11-06 16:49:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach 💯   Understanding context and filtering out baseless claims is key.   Learning the importance of substance behind sentences like “many people are saying it” or “there have been numerous reports” will be critical.   Media detectives.
1324565773050925057 2020-11-06 04:14:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArlanWasHere Not for long. What a talented bunch...  Third time I've watched this tonight.
1324493289958027265 2020-11-05 23:26:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley I endorse this message.
1324377263287242754 2020-11-05 15:45:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shl I can still recall reading your article on building a billion-dollar company. I've learned so much just following that journey. It's great to see @Gumroad continuing to thrive.  Congrats, Sahil.
1324137067929063425 2020-11-04 23:50:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CaseyNewton I think so as well, but figured you might be privy to more of the inner workings. Appreciate it.
1324136182821855232 2020-11-04 23:47:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CaseyNewton @Twitter @yoyoel @kayvz If Trump loses, do you feel as though Twitter will treat him differently as a former president than they do as the current president?
1324127415078182912 2020-11-04 23:12:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dremilyanhalt Holy spot on.
1324104946048970753 2020-11-04 21:43:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephanjenkins What an awesome thing to do.
1324032220101836801 2020-11-04 16:54:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Reza_DTC Have thought about it, but not taken any action.  Working on a new project that I think could be ripe for that.
1324031549210271745 2020-11-04 16:51:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Reza_DTC Sorry, think you're misreading the Tweet.  Spent 20 hours creating the product over 2 weeks.  Did $64k in the first 12 months, not 1 day.  $50 product - I didn't even "launch". Just feature it on my LinkedIn profile &amp; my content gets viewed ~28M times per year on that channel.
1324029039154241538 2020-11-04 16:41:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Reza_DTC Patience + consistency.   Putting out relevant content every day and then helping my audience do the same.
1323383753666973696 2020-11-02 21:57:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Thanks, my man.
1323345863876509696 2020-11-02 19:26:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FilipSturman Only one these past 12 months, LinkedIn. Will likely add more these next 12.
1323344529718738944 2020-11-02 19:21:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brandonthezhang None of these. Time.
1323344440539467778 2020-11-02 19:21:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort Just a week. Work + Sleep + tamales + mezcal.
1323342480557985793 2020-11-02 19:13:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndyCabistan It just took pushing the ball forward finally. So thankful.
1323341255930249216 2020-11-02 19:08:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Off to Oaxaca, Mexico to work for a bit.   Wheels up, head down.
1323339600127995910 2020-11-02 19:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattboneal @jackbutcher Had the chance to hang with Jack recently. Really bright guy.   Next year I hope to be posting much bigger numbers.   Long game.
1323336000408604675 2020-11-02 18:47:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Sometimes a little smack works wonders. 🙂
1323335024628977665 2020-11-02 18:43:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP I wish this were the craziest message a saw.
1323331956965363712 2020-11-02 18:31:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @peterpham Landing page with deadline funnel perhaps? May work.
1323330223073644551 2020-11-02 18:24:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @erikbison Been a fun year man.
1323319509550276610 2020-11-02 17:42:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis Thanks, man. I don’t. I don’t think I’ve ever made an affiliate sale.
1323316949066141698 2020-11-02 17:32:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Just The LinkedIn Playbook.
1323315113152126976 2020-11-02 17:24:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1 year ago I launched my first product online.  It took 20 hours and made $64,894.   That’s $3,245 an hour.   Wow. Build things that sell forever.  https://t.co/GB3WtC165K
1323278944460656643 2020-11-02 15:01:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2020 is a great year to build something for yourself.   Fail and it's expected. You have every excuse.  Succeed? You're probably onto something.
1323264195501109249 2020-11-02 14:02:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Congratulations, Matt. Been following you here for a while and this is such great news.   Let me know if you want to grab a 🍺 herer in Nashville sometime. Best of luck on your first day. Cheers.
1323253562097520646 2020-11-02 13:20:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki I’ve found this to be a really important lesson.   It’s easy to look around and get FOMO only to remember those things aren’t important to your actual definition of success.   Stay focused.
1323055318788722689 2020-11-02 00:12:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sroussey @domm @fast Thanks for sharing this. Diving in!
1323037460369186816 2020-11-01 23:01:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @domm @fast Everything associated with moving to a new home, especially if it comes with having to get a new state license, license plates, etc.
1323036174076813313 2020-11-01 22:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst @pipe Congrats, Harry. Knew from our first convo that you had a bold and exceptional idea.   Keep the wins (and news) coming.
1322682184818282496 2020-10-31 23:29:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @austin_rief Thought Palm Springs with Andy Samberg was weird, wild and pretty interesting.
1322676594167681024 2020-10-31 23:07:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheCoolestCool @randfish Unlearning is key in so many ways. Biases, habits, work, routines, etc.   Wrote this a year after leaving my executive role.  https://t.co/qYxh6Dbq3L
1322659727701086209 2020-10-31 22:00:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @jackbutcher Thanks, man. Loving this city.
1322652558867996672 2020-10-31 21:31:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abarrallen Kite Runner was excellent.
1322652135075549187 2020-10-31 21:30:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher It’s more keeping the dogs in than intruders out.
1322648375129493506 2020-10-31 21:15:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jackbutcher A new house in East Nashville.  https://t.co/LYzJXOiKwn
1322614517323436035 2020-10-31 19:00:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NaithanJones Just wait until you have Joyland some day. Game changer.
1321175260637646849 2020-10-27 19:41:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @edward_gorbis @BUSlNESSBARISTA Appreciate that!
1320406762860781570 2020-10-25 16:47:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo It also feels like, with work like consulting, each day you get further away from your last relevant role. With that can come declining prospect interest.   With variable income, you choose to stay relevant with each new product/service/offering.  They are always timely.
1320015935948939265 2020-10-24 14:54:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justincardillo Not too badly. Haven’t spent a ton of time on here but have gone from 400 to almost 2,000 in the last 6 months or so. Slow and steady.
1319464090176290823 2020-10-23 02:22:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth I’m sure he’d say “good” in his private life.
1319463278075150338 2020-10-23 02:18:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth I’ll let you be the judge, but I’m pretty sure that’s what he said. He’s still a demon.
1319462731431464968 2020-10-23 02:16:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth I’ve watched a few times. As much as I hate him, I think he said, “Go head”. (Go ahead)
1319453486153666569 2020-10-23 01:40:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @garyvee I love political Gary Vee.
1319063758887636998 2020-10-21 23:51:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @FamousAlan Nailed it.   Knowledge is an asset.  Package it up.  Scale it up.
1319056914853093376 2020-10-21 23:24:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markymetry Thanks, Mark. When I realized this, life became easier.
1319055233503383552 2020-10-21 23:17:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ohpinion8ted Being a 19 year old jerk.
1319006408684208128 2020-10-21 20:03:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Same here.  I meet many amazing people who believe they have nothing to sell.   They explain their competency and it’s mind-blowing to me.
1319005774098665473 2020-10-21 20:00:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everything that you think is "obvious" is worth money to someone else.
1319004623798259715 2020-10-21 19:56:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Thanks, Daniel.  I haven't used iCal much, so I'll just need to familiarize myself. Appreciate that.
1319004403383345159 2020-10-21 19:55:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bcorcoran @dvassallo @dhh That's helpful, Brendan. I hadn't considered using that.   Will look into setting that up today. Thanks.
1319004158628954114 2020-10-21 19:54:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dhh @dvassallo That's a very fair point.  To be clear, I prefer HEY to Google in nearly every way, shape, and form.   The calendar would be the nail in the coffin for my usage of all things Google. And I'd welcome that.   Looking forward to watching the product continue to evolve.
1319002050148159488 2020-10-21 19:46:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @dhh They need a calendar desperately. Until they have one, it's super challenging for me to use. I love everything else about it.   I understand that I can add my GCal via .ics but it's an extra step that I find annoying.  How are you managing this, Daniel?
1318277883790577678 2020-10-19 19:48:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc @IFTTT I’ve actually found some pretty cool use cases recently. Tied my outdoor cams to inside lights so if someone walks into my front yard at night the dining room lights come on inside.
1318230560347688960 2020-10-19 16:40:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese NOW you're speaking my language :)
1316524718183329794 2020-10-14 23:42:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BTrautschold Damn. I couldn’t build this well in Sim City.
1316122516981772293 2020-10-13 21:03:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Shoot me URL!
1316119582004871170 2020-10-13 20:52:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese I’d get a zero with my salty attitude.
1316118931724271623 2020-10-13 20:49:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese They nailed that personality part though!
1316059044877160448 2020-10-13 16:51:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MiaKiraki I write for very specific reasons, namely to grow my business.   I've always stayed motivated by watching engagement grow and through strong qualitative feedback.   Be intentional, consistent and patient.
1316054233750405123 2020-10-13 16:32:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat Mostly LinkedIn, some public blog, some private writing.
1316046043373596675 2020-10-13 16:00:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tlob A Tweet doesn't (for me - just my personal take).  Usually, I write between 800 - 1,300 characters, but I don't have a hard and fast rule. I just want to publish something I'm proud of, adds value, and help my audience each day.
1316045769208737794 2020-10-13 15:58:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat I don't have a word target. My goal is just to publish anything (longer than a Tweet)...when I'm feeling creative, I might write two or three things. When I'm not, I'll push out one.   It's a good muscle to build.
1316020100919484418 2020-10-13 14:16:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thealibilawal Thanks, Ali. I appreciate that.  How often are you writing?
1316019149022273546 2020-10-13 14:13:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I committed to writing daily 18 months ago. Here are my results:  → 82.4% adherence → 445 unique content pieces → 40,000+ new social followers  Not 100%, but what an amazing journey.  I believe learning to write is a gift to yourself.
1314654975163805696 2020-10-09 19:52:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BearHeiser @thescottleese My touch is usually pretty soft :) All bark, very little bite.   Given the times we're in, everyone can use some more empathy. Appreciate the reminder. You also be well!
1314607202741760006 2020-10-09 16:42:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HenpeckedHal This gave me a good, hard laugh.
1314606041359945728 2020-10-09 16:37:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BearHeiser @thescottleese Just to be clear here, I do about 3 calls per week, pro-bono, to help people. They are just always reserved for people that have made an effort over time to build a relationship.   As someone who is self-employed, my time is my income.   This young lady was a total stranger.
1314342684006535169 2020-10-08 23:11:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmcody @kyleplacy Thanks, Cody. Kyle did a great job of making the environment a place where I could share openly.   All on the host.
1314326206221873154 2020-10-08 22:06:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy Smart.
1314324866607259649 2020-10-08 22:00:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy You back on the wine?
1314219984336322560 2020-10-08 15:03:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Thanks bud!
1314205904267403268 2020-10-08 14:07:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @kyleplacy  https://t.co/kvLxFKSeX7
1314205123174752256 2020-10-08 14:04:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy is putting together one of the most real, rawest podcasts online today.   I talk about priorities, outlets, and mental health. Give it a listen.
1314200601459388416 2020-10-08 13:46:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffbajorek How would you define expertise?
1313953999012454405 2020-10-07 21:27:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Expertise is a fallacy.  Experience is what matters.  Look a few steps behind you.   Those are your future customers.
1313901856289062912 2020-10-07 17:59:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianSexton13 @thescottleese @SalesRebellion @thejoshuadesha @strategyofstory @YouMapCreator Shoot me a note: hello@theofficialjustin.com
1313900445463711744 2020-10-07 17:54:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @meddpicc @jasonvana @thescottleese Haha.
1313900327645650944 2020-10-07 17:53:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrianSexton13 I choose podcasts that align with my audience and I feel are a good value for time. I don’t charge. Speaking events that are large and have tremendous benefit (SaaStr for example) I also gladly do.   Smaller speaking engagements I charge for.
1313848516406652928 2020-10-07 14:27:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegerhardt Immediately mute all channels.
1313846295791009792 2020-10-07 14:19:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @StabileGabe @thescottleese It comes with the territory, unfortunately.  I get this type of message every single day.
1313846035425394688 2020-10-07 14:17:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @thescottleese This remains my favorite Tweet on the matter:  https://t.co/ododbrHDn8
1313844461789761536 2020-10-07 14:11:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese "Disappointing"  https://t.co/5RZtPmpZdZ
1313649866019614722 2020-10-07 01:18:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy 2 mentions tonight? Man...I must have done something special.  In all seriousness, this was a refreshing show to be a part of. Thanks got having me Kyle.
1313645057753468929 2020-10-07 00:59:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort This was all around my convo with you. Led me down a really interesting path.   I thought it was "serendipity" per our text.  Not sure now. Feels more like effort + curiosity.
1313617738661875713 2020-10-06 23:10:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy @thescottleese @AvenueTP @morganjingram @TomBoccard Thanks, Kyle. I'm just a guy who hires smarter, more talented people to make me look good :)   I feel the same way about you for marketing. Cheers.
1313602170231705604 2020-10-06 22:08:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Serendipity does not exist.  It's the result of compounding effort + curiosity.
1313270853115801607 2020-10-06 00:12:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lilmac024 @alexpesta @TommysCoventry J. Riggins...wow...I remember that. That's a blast from the past.
1312823451921547264 2020-10-04 18:34:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy Ooh. Interesting. I’ll check this out.
1312818028388769794 2020-10-04 18:13:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy Weird to read this. Been restoring my cast iron today.   Vinegar + water to restore.  Grape seed oil to season.   That’s my routine.
1312441020450103299 2020-10-03 17:14:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst “Yep, I’m on, boss!”  https://t.co/CVNePbWh76
1312440357196492800 2020-10-03 17:12:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst That...yes. 100%.   Also, it’s just objectively messy.   I can’t imagine the time wasted on every zip code analysis. Good lord.
1312439002260070407 2020-10-03 17:06:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst I’m watching companies make the decision to base pay on the employees geography.   I just cannot fathom that decision.  Glad to see you’re making a different (and better) call.
1312097137342197762 2020-10-02 18:28:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @thescottleese @kyleplacy Guilty :)
1312094314001043457 2020-10-02 18:17:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @kyleplacy How do y'all stay up-to-date with the newest and coolest conspiracy theories?
1311733386554343425 2020-10-01 18:23:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @paulg This is such an important statement and lesson. Great to see you sharing it. Lots of amazing people suffer from impostor syndrome and that behavior only crushes them.
1311403882011152384 2020-09-30 20:33:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo That intersection between meaningful work, good income and freedom is what I’m striving for now.   I think you have helped push a lot of people toward that, Daniel.   Keep up the great work.
1311327262256529409 2020-09-30 15:29:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Congratulations, Scott! And what an awesome ride it has been to follow.  I'm on 425. It only gets better :)
1311325817956335626 2020-09-30 15:23:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @thealibilawal Agreed. What do you think is the most important thing to be consistent with?
1311323285058203649 2020-09-30 15:13:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @thealibilawal I agree that it's more than just consistency...I'd say what you focus on is key, but the points I listed above are still valid...(I think)
1311131865739337729 2020-09-30 02:32:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs It’s great for his supporters.
1311122061276971014 2020-09-30 01:53:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SVMansuri Nope. He looks terrible. It’s like deciding on the better CEO because of a 90 minute debate when one CEO has been fucking shit up for 4 years. Let’s get real here.
1311121099833454596 2020-09-30 01:50:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SVMansuri I’m not sure you know what presidential means.
1311107110709719040 2020-09-30 00:54:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit I laugh but then I cry.   Good times, indeed.
1311104494537711616 2020-09-30 00:44:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit Fanboys gonna fanboy. Can’t imagine waking up each morning to diligently serve someone who would slit my throat for $.10

1310555704722415616 2020-09-28 12:23:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arteeninLA Congrats, Arteen. What a great get!

1308918960176406536 2020-09-23 23:59:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmandaMGoetz Any great employer should be a happy participant in your growth journey.   I've found nearly all of my previous employers to be cheerleaders of growth, especially when you're candid.
1308803061582831616 2020-09-23 16:19:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales @samfjacobs @thescottleese Bonjour. Je suis heureux de me joindre au Canada en tant que citoyen. Pouvez-vous me montrer où est la bonne pizza, s'il vous plaît ?
1308746785628868608 2020-09-23 12:35:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IamBenforReal @dwilliamriggs @cullinmcgrath @jasonvana @Ned_Arick @JordanTParis Just seeing this. Thanks, David!
1308557891553685505 2020-09-23 00:04:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @domm This☝🏻  Enjoying watching what you all are doing over at @fast. Cheering you on from afar, Domm.
1308426931390550018 2020-09-22 15:24:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese I dunno man. I've seen plenty of SDRs and AEs in my day do the same stuff over and over again for months even though it's not working. IMO it's lack of training + lack of learning mentality + path of least resistance.   I hope it's not working.
1308157976512004096 2020-09-21 21:35:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randfish @ErwanDerlyn @caseyhen You're welcome. Figured I'd at least share it on the platform where I have some reach 😆
1308154727859978240 2020-09-21 21:22:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randfish @ErwanDerlyn I think you'll enjoy this:  https://t.co/TbtiMPLjgE
1308107117941919744 2020-09-21 18:13:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harrydry @fast is pretty damn impressive at this (IMO)
1308097956248260608 2020-09-21 17:37:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @YanceySanderson Yep, or as people we just need to rebrand what strength really looks like.
1308092517326430208 2020-09-21 17:15:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markymetry I always forget how impactful it is until I'm finished with a session.
1308091965465071616 2020-09-21 17:13:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> On that note, I'm glad to see companies like Frame ( https://t.co/tH6VNPYUgJ) and Headway ( https://t.co/xXcO3WBxcR) working on this problem.
1308091964424949760 2020-09-21 17:13:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Therapy is a cheat code.  Went for the first time in 7 years yesterday. Came out feeling like a million bucks.  The fact that there is a significant barrier to entry in the US is a catastrophe.
1308085045035503616 2020-09-21 16:45:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach Best part is the speed at which you can experiment.   - Try something. Flops.  - Try something again. Goes great.  All in less than 15 minutes...
1305630648426786816 2020-09-14 22:12:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arteeninLA @shl @gumroad @philip_kiely @jackzerby Nailed it with the @dvassallo hire as well. Been following his journey since the beginning.
1305563919394668545 2020-09-14 17:47:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randfish Signing up for my account now.   Bravo, @hotjar.
1305560548126461961 2020-09-14 17:34:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hoomanradfar @JWellsCFO @dwilliamriggs @MacSparky @cfoandrew @CooleyLLP @UpCounsel Hooman - thanks for this. It's small deals, so likely no need for a firm like Cooley, but sounds like UpCounsel is what I'm looking for. Appreciate it!
1305560326205845510 2020-09-14 17:33:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland Actually doesn't matter to me. Could be located anywhere.

1305514145253593088 2020-09-14 14:30:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @voiceofandre @UpCounsel Interesting. This is awesome. Thanks for sharing...
1305507599220183040 2020-09-14 14:04:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I want to invest a few thousand $$ in a local business.  Need simple paperwork to reflect a rev-share agreement.  Any lawyers that can make this happen?
1304828112585330690 2020-09-12 17:03:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelwolber Thanks, Mike!
1304816809674182656 2020-09-12 16:19:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmj External charm but internal sociopathy?
1304815789632036866 2020-09-12 16:15:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Great companies are built with great people.   It's easy to hire them when they want to work with you.   Start by becoming someone great people want to work with.
1304447693608169474 2020-09-11 15:52:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pereusfrance @ohpinion8ted Haha. I was just laughing at Darryl's response. I like words.
1304393604819898369 2020-09-11 12:17:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ohpinion8ted @pereusfrance Same process here.
1304201814015963139 2020-09-10 23:35:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvglantin I'm rooting for you too!
1304200276946096132 2020-09-10 23:29:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach Externally "successful" is subjective.   Internal happiness feels much more objective.   Optimize for the 2nd.
1304199908724011010 2020-09-10 23:27:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BlueHairdDodo If you can read and ignore, you're a Jedi :)
1304196905476517895 2020-09-10 23:15:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @vigorhabits Love it. Glad it's inspiring! Let's get it.
1304195704814997504 2020-09-10 23:11:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @randfish Show me the company that's been passed on multiple times over, that is now nailing it.   I'm more interested in how companies get from $0 to something than from $8B to $10B.    Relevancy.
1304195299351691265 2020-09-10 23:09:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I can't imagine being a hater.  I get too amped up watching people reach insane potential.   Root for people.
1304194802813218821 2020-09-10 23:07:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArlanWasHere Keep that noise out. Rooting for you to nail that 10x. 💪🏻
1304192572466831360 2020-09-10 22:58:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kumailn Matched.
1304097742583746560 2020-09-10 16:41:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @briannekimmel Interesting. I always enjoyed the opposite.  Up at 5a ET in NYC meant I had 6-7 hours before people from LA started reaching out...
1303821377603014657 2020-09-09 22:23:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram @thescottleese @AnandThaker I have a better hack for knowing when someone is doing lazy automation.   Read it.   If it’s shit, it’s lazy automation. 🙂
1303793462697963521 2020-09-09 20:32:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NathanLatka Thanks for sharing. I would know...I make my living off of it. 🤷‍♂️
1303790604334387201 2020-09-09 20:21:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NathanLatka Smart companies are hiring entertaining people to promote their brand as ambassadors.  And it's working.   Eyeballs and attention matter.
1303772180459794434 2020-09-09 19:08:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @shl Just started meeting with people that I know who are standing up MVPs. To clarify, I have not made one yet. Just set aside a decent chunk of my own capital hoping to find the right fit. Will keep you posted, though.
1303771242714066947 2020-09-09 19:04:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shl Just dipping my toe in. Small and focused.

1303496390744604674 2020-09-09 00:52:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joindgmg @guillaumecabane Anytime. I share what I enjoy, Dave.
1303441743459868674 2020-09-08 21:15:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy We could get these 2 guys involved:  https://t.co/grnf1eP8l8
1303425208628514819 2020-09-08 20:09:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @kyleplacy 😂
1303408692935692289 2020-09-08 19:03:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @kyleplacy NO. That is absolutely hilarious. Small world.   I'm now angry at you for not mentioning it.
1303404444483289093 2020-09-08 18:46:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy Want me to intro him to this guy?  https://t.co/tV3cZZFl72
1303362760621817856 2020-09-08 16:01:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Want to make 100k+ in side income next year?   Spend one hour per day building an audience online and NEVER ask them for anything.   Just give, give, give.   Next year? Ask.
1303337655267196928 2020-09-08 14:21:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @erikbison That's right. If you're not getting started, there is a pretty big opportunity cost IMO.
1303335951364755456 2020-09-08 14:14:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Most people work for 40 years for 10 companies that would replace them in 2 seconds.  Break free from the lifelong trap.  Create your own income.
1303156808316530691 2020-09-08 02:22:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EliusSantos It does. 6 month retainer usually.
1303096935432232968 2020-09-07 22:24:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nasela30 I love Toronto. Have always had amazing times there.
1303094212607594497 2020-09-07 22:14:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Nasela30 Depends on what! Joe Beef/Liverpool House dishes? Poutine? Montreal style bagels? Nanaimo Bars?
1303081000650633216 2020-09-07 21:21:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_beaumont It’s usually either/or. I’ll land a consulting client, finish project and end up on advisory board.   Reverse is I’ll start on board, and then they’ll come ask if I can help with a project.   I also sell a course that upsells to 1:1 coaching.
1303076998361812997 2020-09-07 21:05:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_beaumont Advisory is just a retainer payment for being available via phone/email.  Consulting is working with founders to complete a specific project with an SOW and deliverables.  1:1 coaching is generally weekly meetings with an executive who is looking to grow.  Definitely plan on it.
1303070123402711043 2020-09-07 20:38:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland This is awesome, thanks, Matt!
1303068329226231808 2020-09-07 20:31:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs I don't really "promote" outside of my daily LinkedIn post.  For 2 months, I promoted LI playbook 1x per week on LI. Those months I did between 10k - 12k/mo. When I don't, I do about 4k.   Consulting/advising I don't promote unless you count podcast appearances and what not...
1303064852911599617 2020-09-07 20:17:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mtrusler @mkobach Very much appreciated, Melissa.
1303063615499644938 2020-09-07 20:12:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasihlen @mkobach Much appreciated. Hope not to disappoint...
1303063493780832265 2020-09-07 20:12:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I spent 12 months building an audience on social before leaving my executive job.   Here's how I backfilled my income:  - 43.5% consulting (work + deliverables) - 31.8% advisory work (just being available) - 15.9% on 1:1 coaching (exec) - 8.8% on info products (one course)
1303060514717736961 2020-09-07 20:00:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach I walked away from my high-paying executive job in 2019 with nothing more than a decent following on LinkedIn. In the next 12 months, I tinkered with multiple income sources and made my income back and then some. I tweet about how I did that here (if that's interesting to people)
1303058810672734211 2020-09-07 19:53:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BTrautschold @markmcwatters Brian - educate me! I don't wanna be that guy 😦
1303056594125676544 2020-09-07 19:44:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_DaveyRussell Yep. The one in East Nashville. Love their brisket and banana pudding.
1303056366282715137 2020-09-07 19:43:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markmcwatters @BTrautschold That's where this pic is from. Delicious.
1303045786339610625 2020-09-07 19:01:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BTrautschold I'd like to do that. What spot do you recommend?   Btw, been getting exposed to great Nashville food from @markmcwatters
1303041261226602496 2020-09-07 18:43:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs I don’t understand how I ever lived without this.
1303038853511548929 2020-09-07 18:34:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I went from eating BBQ 2x per year in LA to 2x per week in Nashville.   Happy Labor Day.  https://t.co/pzMMSgs3us

Takers are people who don't make any effort to get to know you or interact with you. They just reach out and ask for free time.   Hope this helps.  https://t.co/luuYO9mwuJ

1300820048928542727 2020-09-01 15:37:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Is the variance in your revenue simply based on promotion?  If so, have you found a sweet spot in terms of the number of promotional posts per week?
1300803181102927874 2020-09-01 14:30:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Not too shabby company there.

1298756964483244032 2020-08-26 22:59:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk Get it, Jason! 🙌🏻 Enjoy following from afar.
1298747974969851904 2020-08-26 22:23:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tristajaye I feel like passion for mission, potential to make an impact, and confidence in team should be at the top of list.
1298746788158021632 2020-08-26 22:18:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram Comment ==&gt; content. Love it.
1298729017038823432 2020-08-26 21:08:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tcaponi Hahaha. Take a break for crying out loud, Todd. (Or get a new keyboard)
1298671709122441216 2020-08-26 17:20:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana It’s tough to see as it’s happening. But when you look far back? So easy.
1298668406229602309 2020-08-26 17:07:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When I look at my writing from 24 months ago, I don't even recognize it.  Put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) every day.  Consistency wins.
1298380984639946753 2020-08-25 22:05:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @david_perell Shared an interesting (yet potentially impractical) idea the other day on Twitter.  30 minutes later I had 3 calls scheduled from folks willing to lend a hand.   They can access your best thinking, and you can access theirs. Really cool.
1298316958790815744 2020-08-25 17:50:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit I used to believe money was meant for the market or real estate only.   I've now realized that investing in myself, my own business, and other people's business yields (so far) greater results.  Now, I'm attempting to continue diversifying.
1298306388070932481 2020-08-25 17:08:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales Time for a podcast studio or padded closet.
1298286285673697282 2020-08-25 15:49:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HanaaTameez @cassidoo @AOC I don't always agree with AOC on all platforms, but she certainly is thoughtful, intelligent, and clear-headed. This is such a well-articulated response to what is a clear national problem.
1298285054351769605 2020-08-25 15:44:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When brand building, you need strong opinions.  You'll get some haters, trolls &amp; naysayers, but that's OK.  In the end, they only push your core audience closer.
1297924140045930503 2020-08-24 15:50:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AlecTorelli This is spot on, Alec. Literally, exactly what I was thinking when I wrote this. Thank you so much for sharing this, and to @RafeFurst for creating this. Cheers.
1297876245254897667 2020-08-24 12:39:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AmandaMGoetz As a family that chose not to have kids, I support this.   Parents need support. I get every evening off through my decision, and can't fathom holding this decision against a business.
1297296239445323776 2020-08-22 22:15:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tpelligrino Thanks, Tristan!
1297275491498496000 2020-08-22 20:52:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_beaumont Appreciate you weighing in on this, Bruce. Thanks!
1297273695711502341 2020-08-22 20:45:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @itssarabeam @zoho @zohocrm @bigin Thanks, Sara. Trying to figure out if there is a CRM built specifically for this use case...might not be.
1297273556301156352 2020-08-22 20:44:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KevHopp I agree, just wondering if there was a CRM already built specifically for this use case.
1297273342207168514 2020-08-22 20:44:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bruce_beaumont Smart, thanks, Bruce. What I was hoping for was more real-time visibility. Considering just using Stripe/Zapier/GSheets.
1297268283503267851 2020-08-22 20:23:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Is there a lightweight investment CRM?   I'm making a few small investments in local businesses and need a CRM that can track revenue for rev share purposes.  Preferably via a Stripe/Square connection.  Does this exist?
1297198485373157383 2020-08-22 15:46:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GalemGirmay @thescottleese Try @heyhey
1297192624751890433 2020-08-22 15:23:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @smspecter @sbkaufman I have a family to feed, a mortgage to pay, and clients to support.   Why would I choose to spend 30 minutes of my time with a complete stranger so they can rummage through my brain, for free, instead of spending that time with paid clients or with my family?
1297164029518118912 2020-08-22 13:29:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Yoroomie Jack Dorsey. Time management skills.
1297163830238359552 2020-08-22 13:28:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @areebijaz @iam_kimtryke @mkobach Consistent daily, focused content and engaging with other people. Not too dissimilar from Twitter.
1297159210787131392 2020-08-22 13:10:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iam_kimtryke @mkobach Some people are really good at it, some are absolutely terrible at it. Just like here on Twitter.   I’ve built a pretty decent business just off of LinkedIn. So, I feel like it’s a platform worth exploring.
1297157527843594241 2020-08-22 13:03:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach I think that’s generally how people who use Twitter feel about LinkedIn.   I can tell you, as someone who is a LinkedIn user, the opportunity to get to know people very well on that platform exists just like on Twitter.   Just my two cents.
1296810609141571584 2020-08-21 14:05:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ColinKeeley It depends. If it’s someone I don’t know well, I do not reschedule.   If it’s someone I do know, I reach out and ask what happened.   If it’s the latter, and they no show again? Nah.
1296809728073445377 2020-08-21 14:01:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @iliketodabble I’ve got it automated 4x per month.
1296784948205178883 2020-08-21 12:23:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @afit @schlaf Nope. Never again.
1296556919809880066 2020-08-20 21:17:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Yes. Read everything you can about proper form. Don't just wing it.  As a guy with 2 back surgeries, I can promise you it's important. Enjoy!
1296467918671228932 2020-08-20 15:23:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk LI has been powering my business for 18 months now. It's only getting bigger every month...  https://t.co/QVgac3DAL4

1296222913209802761 2020-08-19 23:09:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NathanLatka I traveled to Austin frequently when this happened and it was a nightmare. I almost missed a flight waiting 30 minutes on a taxi...that you had to call...on the phone.
1296222303269814273 2020-08-19 23:07:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justincardillo I just might. I have an idea on this.
1296216233327681537 2020-08-19 22:43:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo I’m really interested to see how this goes. Will you be publishing the results, Daniel?

1296186149472526336 2020-08-19 20:43:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LandonAinge @SDinwiddie_25 @ArianFoster When I began building my own brand, I likely would have, with the understanding that the source of the investment would have been more important than the investment itself.   When I wrote this, I was thinking of solo creators/solo brands for the most part.
1296183010430267392 2020-08-19 20:31:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LandonAinge @SDinwiddie_25 @ArianFoster I agree. I've been kicking this idea around for a while now and modeling out how it would best work (caveat: I'm an operator by nature, not an investor).   I've spent the last two years investing in myself and the returns have been massive.
1296177215370080257 2020-08-19 20:08:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo Cool, let's do it. Shoot me a note: hello@theofficialjustin.com

Need to dig deeper to fully understand this concept. Reading about Fantex and @ArianFoster now.  Thanks for sharing.
1296174677027684357 2020-08-19 19:58:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tami__mcqueen Appreciate you right back. Cheers, Tami.
1296174459267817473 2020-08-19 19:57:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LandonAinge @SDinwiddie_25 @ArianFoster I'm not familiar with the approach of "tokenizing future earnings", but I'm digging into some articles now. Thanks for sharing.
1296173584835063808 2020-08-19 19:53:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tami__mcqueen Sure, didn't want to hijack your thread, but here ya go:  https://t.co/UEZrtDy0sH
1296172768048959489 2020-08-19 19:50:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tami__mcqueen Just wrote on LinkedIn about this today. Consistency + patience...
1296171791744892929 2020-08-19 19:46:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JayRevell @mkobach This should be excellent. Thanks for sharing.
1296171660807151618 2020-08-19 19:46:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> All I want to do is invest in people.   Not companies. Just individual people.   I've come across so many unique and interesting folks with incredible ideas. I think a small check + some guidance would be all they need to get rolling.
1296170459273125888 2020-08-19 19:41:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Seems like we're synced this week :)
1295816416495570949 2020-08-18 20:14:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People confuse income &amp; wealth.  Income is what your paychecks say.  Wealth is your situation if that paycheck stopped.
1295813621704994816 2020-08-18 20:03:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DomSutton_NZ For the love of god, unteach them.
1295721982873554949 2020-08-18 13:59:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Had a blast interviewing you. What an incredible story you have, Andrew.
1295705611011788802 2020-08-18 12:54:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markymetry Hustle 24/7 is a sham.   There will definitely be times in your entrepreneurial life when it's required to work a long day, but it cannot be constant.  Rest makes a better entrepreneur.
1295449208368005123 2020-08-17 19:55:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SalesRebellion 😂
1295446771678744576 2020-08-17 19:45:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek @cvonhuene Bingo. That's a great one, Derek.
1295412845023318018 2020-08-17 17:31:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @cvonhuene Basically, what Scott said. Either build a relationship or pay. I give some pro-bono time to those who invest time in building a relationship with me.  When people I do not know at all, just reach out and say, "Can I get 30 minutes of your time?", the answer is always no.
1295404084850233344 2020-08-17 16:56:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Can we all just agree to eliminate the "we've never met before, but can I pick your brain" request?  Let's cancel that.
1295163367146098689 2020-08-17 00:59:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the_perell_bot @david_perell School is built for the memorizer. Life is built for the thinker and the creator.
1295075095870873602 2020-08-16 19:08:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BridgetWesson Ain’t it though? Surprised it’s still so uncommon.
1295056272442654721 2020-08-16 17:54:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You gain control with a personal brand.  You have access to jobs, opportunities, networks, and help.  Without one, you're at the mercy of your company.  Want more security? Build your personal brand.
1293634693666136068 2020-08-12 19:45:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP Delete. I hate thread hijackers.
1293534846988554242 2020-08-12 13:08:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BlueHairdDodo It's just more blatant every day. Sickening.
1293534551348850688 2020-08-12 13:07:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stevenbroudy 100%. Always. Part of my early success was being onboarded with incredible salespeople. Pushed me out of my comfort zone and created intense competition.

1292903987981758468 2020-08-10 19:21:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana That's basically my process as well. I might add a little flair to make it interesting, but it's just the problems I'm solving.
1292515101656985600 2020-08-09 17:36:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Yep. I think I'm almost free from the grip. COVID likely accelerated a bit. May have taken me two years rather than one to unlearn the previous 15. Thanks for the reply.
1292513828593373185 2020-08-09 17:31:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo After 12 months of creating my own lifestyle, a big challenge has been unlearning my previous work/life cadence. Did this take you a while as well, Daniel?
1292277155381084161 2020-08-09 01:50:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @garrytan Wow. This hit. Perfect timing and an incredibly well crafted message.

1290326270748889090 2020-08-03 16:38:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst @Patticus It's a really great question. You've eliminated the obvious answers that come to mind, so product adoption was one...I'll give this some additional thought and pop back in.
1290324026133536772 2020-08-03 16:29:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harryhurst @Patticus To me, there are two:   1. Potential improved product adoption through a large financial obligation.  2. Canceling talks become infrequent. With monthly, I always assume customers are observing performance on a month-to-month basis vs. 12-month cycles.

1288497463683354626 2020-07-29 15:31:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJackieHermes @thescottleese I'm down.
1288483781305872385 2020-07-29 14:37:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Haha. Chris Holtz isn't his real name. He even took the time to make a fake Gmail. I know who it is but just don't care enough.
1288481606072709120 2020-07-29 14:28:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SchneiderKJ Definitely. Lots of great people and meaningful conversations. These wackos just stick out a bit more.

1288474131558735874 2020-07-29 13:59:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @KevinEkmark Based on the writing style they definitely have bigger problems.
1288474009655488513 2020-07-29 13:58:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJackieHermes I know! I have a calendar item this weekend to reach out to you. This move has been brutal during COVID. You will definitely be hearing from me. I don't know that I have your email address. Will you DM it to me?
1288473532939280384 2020-07-29 13:56:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shawnkwekinc I think this is hate-lite compared to some stuff I see.
1288472431468912640 2020-07-29 13:52:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJackieHermes Me neither. I sat there just scratching my head. I'm considering making it my new banner image. :)
1288472310043869186 2020-07-29 13:51:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana This was in response to sharing a positive story. People are losing their damn minds.
1288471390711095296 2020-07-29 13:48:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SportsBoyTony I'll bet you get this 100x worse on Twitter.
1288304779563851776 2020-07-29 02:46:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DerekShebby @paulsalamanca It was.
1288301562381639681 2020-07-29 02:33:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @paulsalamanca I'm just blocking now. I had some guy tell me I was a "piece of shit" and "ugly" today. Really weird given I just shared a nice story...I'm not putting up with it anymore. Just blocking.
1288234187011641348 2020-07-28 22:05:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @MatthewGattozzi Thanks man! That's how I intended for it to come across. Great feedback.
1288234100390854658 2020-07-28 22:05:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @MatthewGattozzi Develop away! We all have goodness to share.
1288233131301011456 2020-07-28 22:01:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MatthewGattozzi Awesome! Glad your enjoying it. Cheers.
1288156078858002437 2020-07-28 16:55:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales Love this. Implemeting today.
1287930684082921474 2020-07-28 01:59:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf The better you are, the luckier you get.
1287916420999913473 2020-07-28 01:02:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenrose1010 If you have a plan and you're evaluating it, you're the doubters worst nightmare. A motivated, curious person.
1287888835779723265 2020-07-27 23:13:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Ignore doubters.   Doubt is projection.  Someone else's insecurity pushed on you.  Create your plan. Work it. Be consistent. Be patient.
1286440382209888259 2020-07-23 23:17:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffbajorek Definitely. I can do anything for 5 hours but want to make sure I’m focused on the right thing without leaping at other options. Therein lies the challenge.
1286429505368870928 2020-07-23 22:34:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylesareus This is super helpful. Thanks, Kyle!
1286429389924847623 2020-07-23 22:34:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lilmac024 My struggle is when I think about a podcast I start creating. Logo, website, guests, etc. I get excited and start creating stuff. I’m worried any deviation will result in a rabbit hole experience.
1286422043978866690 2020-07-23 22:04:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BGroat @jasonvana I love that. Thanks, Brian. Appreciate it.
1286420187961528320 2020-07-23 21:57:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana I’m building out a new business and I’m creating a content plan and I get it all completed....  ...Then...  “Oooh! What about a podcast?!”  Down the rabbit hole I go.
1286391537404973064 2020-07-23 20:03:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mrpatrickmc I don’t think there is anything wrong with consumption. I consume all of the time. Was more focused on encouraging people to create. Consume, then create. You learn so much more from creation (IMO)
1285978875470774276 2020-07-22 16:43:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenrose1010 Thanks, man!
1285965521855434755 2020-07-22 15:50:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People work 40 years for 10 companies only to be replaced in 2 seconds.  Break free from the trap.  Start your own business.
1285712671543906304 2020-07-21 23:06:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales Even if there isn’t an objective truth, it will be to formulate opinions based on multiple sources.
1285702342201892864 2020-07-21 22:25:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Stop bragging to everyone that you read 25 books a year. Publish one.  Stop telling everyone about the podcasts you listen to. Record one.  Stop spouting off everything you read in blogs. Write one.  There's no reward for the most consumption. Creation?  That's a different story.
1285679856060190722 2020-07-21 20:55:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DerekShebby @heyhey Yes. It’s one challenge I’m facing.
1284152099190833157 2020-07-17 15:44:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarryStebbings @20vcFund Congrats, @HarryStebbings. Excited to follow along. Cheers.
1283900850394533888 2020-07-16 23:06:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @scottbsales Don't do it!
1283896535789580289 2020-07-16 22:49:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales Next 3-5 months...  (coming to you from Nashville)
1283761550319378434 2020-07-16 13:52:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc What a GREAT read. Very well put together. I've got some green in there, but have put my health in "red" to get those others to green. Hate that. This is good motivation to change.
1283549883903938560 2020-07-15 23:51:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ADT sending unmasked salespeople to my door at 7pm to sell home security systems.  Bold.
1283201478015033349 2020-07-15 00:47:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rogerdickey So stupidly good. I’m a Mayura on Venice Blvd. in Culver City, guy.
1283200772713390081 2020-07-15 00:44:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc If I could give you any advice (unsolicited) it would be this: your early 30s business energy is something tough to replicate. Use it to its full capacity, wisely, each day. Happy bday.
1282273207383478273 2020-07-12 11:18:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth HEY rocks. Better the more you use it too.
1282136958458826756 2020-07-12 02:17:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m @GalemGirmay @scottbsales @thescottleese @jeffbajorek @camilleeclemons @Tiffani_Bova @AvenueTP @aspirechrisrog - momentum - discovery - demo segmentation - authenticity

1282019041713033218 2020-07-11 18:28:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @harrydry @GoodMarketingHQ Thanks, Harry. Would love to learn more about who designed your site and what they used. Cheers and keep up the great work.
1281977179824324609 2020-07-11 15:42:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I just discovered @GoodMarketingHQ.  I don't know if I'll ever get out of this rabbit hole.  Excellent content.
1281949752041578496 2020-07-11 13:53:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach Finding partners in growth is one of the best and fastest ways to achieve.
1281715524335013889 2020-07-10 22:22:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @AvenueTP 100%. Bad sales is invasive.   It's like those people selling skin cream at mall kiosks.
1281714577420492800 2020-07-10 22:19:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @AvenueTP I'm not sure I understand what you mean...
1281713428172865543 2020-07-10 22:14:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @AvenueTP Good sales is better than this. Bad sales is much, much, much worse.
1281608819425124352 2020-07-10 15:18:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SchadenJake @thetakeout @BTParsons Awesome. Really intrigued by this world...thanks for sharing.
1281413199452045317 2020-07-10 02:21:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach We all did.
1281412483773759488 2020-07-10 02:18:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mkobach Requires a nation of complex thinkers where ideas are centerpiece, rather than a large audience rooting two sides of a Jerry Springer debate. (Topical, I know).
1281386644759891974 2020-07-10 00:35:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy @AvenueTP @thescottleese Moving across the country. 😣
1281364694012395528 2020-07-09 23:08:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @briannekimmel Help people get wins early.   Momentum is underrated.

1281302597882830848 2020-07-09 19:01:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> UPDATE: I'm now down to about 5 emails per day.   Perfect for a life focused on more free time.  @heyhey is far from perfect, but it's awesome.
1280625837105123335 2020-07-07 22:12:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarryStebbings Negroni.   Bitter, but in a smooth and delicious way.
1280602505316048905 2020-07-07 20:40:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DerekShebby @jasonfried @thescottleese Checking out. Thanks!
1280561618091417607 2020-07-07 17:57:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs Love this man. So awesome to see people take action. Thank you!!
1280513149733486592 2020-07-07 14:45:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If your friends or fmr. colleagues have lost their jobs, here are 2 things you can do in 10 minutes:  1. Write a short letter of recommendation or LinkedIn rec.  2. Make one intro to a leader or exec that you know is hiring  We're all busy, but let's lift our friends up.
1280269814293049352 2020-07-06 22:38:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Woah.   Money is out there. Get it.
1280159755609296898 2020-07-06 15:20:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo I've found the more small bets you make, the more likely you intersect with good timing.
1280157721518583809 2020-07-06 15:12:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector Your audience is also such a wonderful sounding board in the opposite direction. Your personal focus group that will give you real, raw feedback.
1280156046443655173 2020-07-06 15:06:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People think they have to be at "the top" to serve others.  Don't let this fallacy keep you from getting started.  Look a few steps behind you.   Those are your customers.
1279451414021001216 2020-07-04 16:26:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jspector The Nightman Cometh from @alwayssunny
1279196714742755329 2020-07-03 23:33:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collincadmus On our way...just a stopover!
1279189278082379776 2020-07-03 23:04:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Coming to you live from our patio in Austin...  https://t.co/SyUVgXI4oY
1279119354748174336 2020-07-03 18:26:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> America has become one big click-bait headline.   Constant consumption is the surest way to lose.
1278831557055336448 2020-07-02 23:22:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Thanks for the shoutout ⁦@SweetFishMedia⁩   https://t.co/7tmXwcwq4b
1278755654212227073 2020-07-02 18:21:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DerekShebby I ignore and press on with my business, time and life.
1278740054425440262 2020-07-02 17:19:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs That's right.   Ignore the arguing. Ignore the folks driving us apart.  Instead...build.
1278738292096327680 2020-07-02 17:12:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joelrandyblake That's why most people toil away rather than building their own life.
1278737333584572417 2020-07-02 17:08:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Imagine if everyone arguing on Twitter spent that same energy building something.
1278689566178922502 2020-07-02 13:58:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Happy birthday old man.
1278660073527619589 2020-07-02 12:01:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy I'm just got done driving through West Texas...0% masks.
1278434198550982657 2020-07-01 21:03:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Mazzeo Teach me your favorite complex idea like I’m a kindergartner.
1278364669804240896 2020-07-01 16:27:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MatthewGattozzi I’m stoked that you’re stoked!
1278283338919415808 2020-07-01 11:04:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenrose1010 Shoot a note to admin@theofficialjustin.com and Rachel on my team will share a menu. Thanks, Stephen.
1278107588895346689 2020-06-30 23:26:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @tami__mcqueen Anyone who shells first...I mean...I've got my eye on that person. Not leaving my sight.
1278099130582261760 2020-06-30 22:52:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Same. Sometimes you just get magic clients.
1278098470268780544 2020-06-30 22:49:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs @heyhey Both right now!
1278098037102051328 2020-06-30 22:48:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Had 4 personal coaching calls today.   They were all prepared, excited and ready to grow their business.  Some from SaaS. Some just building a solopreneurship.  All of them were as fulfilling as hell. ❤️
1278062140222513153 2020-06-30 20:25:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IMaddalozzo @heyhey I have. I really enjoyed Superhuman, but ultimately HEY gives me more control over my inbox. It keeps it super clean, rather than having to constantly triage.
1278030545851736065 2020-06-30 18:20:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DerekShebby @jasonvana @heyhey Yes. Multiple gmail accounts are being forwarded.
1278025074092670977 2020-06-30 17:58:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DerekShebby @jasonvana @heyhey Yes. One issue has been that since your email address will likely be similar when you reply, it sometimes triggers a phishing warning. Other than that, no issues.
1278021926703808515 2020-06-30 17:45:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rockyclark1 @heyhey Yep. All of my gmail right now.
1278017126817816581 2020-06-30 17:26:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @heyhey The more you use it, the more valuable it becomes, IMO. I've screened out so much junk and now my inbox is just important email. That's it.   If I want to read marketing newsletters, I can scroll them like Twitter. Brilliant.
1278015880509693952 2020-06-30 17:21:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @heyhey Sure thing. Thanks for the awesome (and affordable) product. Cheers.
1278015737756598272 2020-06-30 17:21:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HighTailTom @heyhey IMO, it's valuable for anyone who has a crammed inbox. I've gotten rid of all of the noise and junk that floats in...
1278014747489849344 2020-06-30 17:17:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My inbox is mine again.  In my first week using @heyhey, I've gone from hundreds of emails per day to just 10-15 important ones.   I feel like I've gained control over my email.  What a win.
1277968738319339529 2020-06-30 14:14:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JALyles @shahedkader I always try...  To me, interaction is a must. It's tough to interact effectively when you lose that highest level of engagement...(the present)
1277963120162426883 2020-06-30 13:52:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @jasonvana I’m turning 39 in 12 days. Feel ya’ll. I’m excited though.
1277959570766389248 2020-06-30 13:37:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Happy bday homie.
1277950400289738754 2020-06-30 13:01:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AdamMGrant @pqblair I feel the same way about certifications for many roles. Some are prohibitive because of cost. They keep folks locked out.   Imagine if LeBron James would have had to get "certified" to play basketball &amp; spend thousands of dollars to achieve that certification.  Let skills talk.
1277631752287203328 2020-06-29 15:55:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GalemGirmay I had a lot of fun, Galem. Can't wait to see your brand thrive :)
1277604233454522369 2020-06-29 14:06:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JALyles Smart. I can’t wait to get to Nashville and get back to routine-based living. (At least the exercising part of it).
1277603778796097536 2020-06-29 14:04:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana I’m struggling so just reminding myself...
1277602998705946625 2020-06-29 14:01:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JALyles Same. I've been road-tripping and have struggled to find the time. Plus, we've been eating and drinking too much. This is a reminder to myself as well...
1277601463578091520 2020-06-29 13:55:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Simple career advice:  -Practice everyday -Root for your teammates -Come in 30 minutes earlier  -Limit alcohol during the week -Start listening and stop talking -Surround yourself with winners  -Clear your head with a walk each day  "Being better" begins with your approach.
1277366892215316480 2020-06-28 22:22:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JakeTDunlap I’m finally in ATX. Sonora...interesting...no masks but a crazy good BBQ spot called Pit Stop.
1277356859427610624 2020-06-28 21:43:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_harryhurst  https://t.co/eMegv3lq5m
1277305814462726146 2020-06-28 18:20:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @markmcwatters Awesome, thanks, Mark!
1277281225292603392 2020-06-28 16:42:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SVMansuri Yup. Wrote an article on this a while back. It's weird how it happens.
1277227067306840071 2020-06-28 13:07:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BTrautschold Looking forward to arriving, Brian. Thanks!
1277210237980770304 2020-06-28 12:00:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HackItMax Absolutely....at it's finest.
1277059202922536960 2020-06-28 02:00:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Yep. That too.
1277048016575303680 2020-06-28 01:15:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo This guy holding a sign on the left also appears to be choking out a bald friend. I'm confused but intrigued.
1277047503603580928 2020-06-28 01:13:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo I'm not sure what's going on in this GIF but I like it.
1277045732097183744 2020-06-28 01:06:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyledackerman @BGroat I think as a solo brand, the longer you give...the more compelling ask. So basically what @kyledackerman said.
1277045146593484800 2020-06-28 01:04:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So many brilliant people think they are impostors.   So many impostors think they are brilliant.   This is part of the reason we have the America we do today.   🤷🏻‍♂️
1277021877551202306 2020-06-27 23:31:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10 days into our cross-country move to Nashville.  From Los Angeles, CA to Sonora, TX so far...  - Drive time: 17 hours - Dining cost: Down 60% - People wearing masks: Down 90%  https://t.co/bR5afML9mW
1276887682598293507 2020-06-27 14:38:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @cvonhuene Can't wait!
1276876970077323265 2020-06-27 13:56:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jumpcrew_noah @dvassallo Thanks, Noah - glad you liked it, man.
1276876763541487618 2020-06-27 13:55:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cvonhuene Do I sense some Donald Miller in there?
1276711856640528385 2020-06-27 03:00:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Doing the same right now. Moving out of LA and into Nashville. Crazy difference, especially given state income tax.
1276236085358743555 2020-06-25 19:29:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DerekShebby @thescottleese @gaetano_nyc @AvenueTP @aspirechrisrog @outreach_io Awesome, see ya there, man!
1276233436605435904 2020-06-25 19:18:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DerekShebby @MaximWheatley Lunacy. I just laugh and BUH-lock.
1276231551294902272 2020-06-25 19:11:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MaximWheatley Well. Someone reached out to my wife yesterday and said, “I know you’re married but I run a matchmaking service just in case you’re interested.”  How about that?
1276228513314545669 2020-06-25 18:59:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I love blocking people on LinkedIn.
1276198159178326016 2020-06-25 16:58:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IAmNadiyah Love that. That’s my mantra
1276176200034025474 2020-06-25 15:31:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SkuIIdouggery Ordering it now...sounds like my type of read!
1276173047339388928 2020-06-25 15:18:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've found the easiest way to upset someone is to suggest that they control their own destiny/life/career.
1276161912343080965 2020-06-25 14:34:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana @dhh @dwilliamriggs I'm absolutely loving it right now.
1276158315739918339 2020-06-25 14:20:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dhh @jasonvana @dwilliamriggs Looks like HEY is now open to the public.
1276140910342856704 2020-06-25 13:11:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @adtechmartech thanks, Justin!
1276000582600323072 2020-06-25 03:53:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo @DerekShebby @davegerhardt Good choices, Derek!
1275972843444908033 2020-06-25 02:03:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau @jasonvana Have zero invites so far. Expect some once I pay
1275915747978510337 2020-06-24 22:16:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales NVM. Saw it's Divi. Really nice.
1275915585457717248 2020-06-24 22:15:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales The thing I got from it is clearly defined CTAs and simplified headings. (btw - I'm not saying you aren't doing that).   I think, in general, the book outlines incredible website copy very well. It's by Donald Miller.  Side note: what website builder did you use? Looks sharp.
1275914155099373569 2020-06-24 22:10:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @scottbsales I like it...just something small missing that makes me and others (possibly) not connect all of the dots.   Have you read Building a StoryBrand?
1275897324997242880 2020-06-24 21:03:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabevillamizar Only a few hours in but seems like it. Really intuitive, fast, and gives me control back.
1275896580776710144 2020-06-24 21:00:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabevillamizar Just got access. Really loving it so far.
1275887506278559744 2020-06-24 20:24:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana Absolutely. I decided to ask you to do some content and then start a cross-country move. Whoops 🤷‍♂️
1275885404324052992 2020-06-24 20:15:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana I think once I pay for it, I'll get some and shoot it to ya.   I just emailed them, asked for one, and got one 72 hours later.
1275884055834382336 2020-06-24 20:10:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana I'm really enjoying the simplicity and how it's built for my control.
1275883987647582210 2020-06-24 20:10:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs So far, so good man. Just been using it for a few hours, but completely intuitive and protective of my space.
1275881555198648320 2020-06-24 20:00:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Super stoked to get access to HEY.   I already feel like I have control of my email again.
1275267113725202432 2020-06-23 03:19:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Matthew56179905 self employment + tax intelligence + expense reduction.
1275230438852685825 2020-06-23 00:53:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexisohanian This quote gave me chills. I just read it aloud to my wife and she said the same. I have never heard it, so thank you for sharing.
1275228984796540928 2020-06-23 00:47:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I’m so impressed by Gen-Z.   I don’t understand everything they do and I don’t always agree with it at first.   But by asking some questions, I always learn a ton. And, I usually end up changing my mind.   Really happy that earth is in their hands. 🌎
1275201152473276417 2020-06-22 22:57:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There has never been a better (or more urgent) time to redesign your life.   Those who are hyper-intentional about it will win.

1273667474597113857 2020-06-18 17:22:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Thanks for the nice shoutout in @crunchbase today, @thescottleese.    https://t.co/4TwvOQyQjH
1273316183467454465 2020-06-17 18:06:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HackItMax That's amazing. This made me smile, thanks for sharing, Max.

I nominate @brendanjshort @thescottleese @scottbsales @jasonvana @AvenueTP ... make the pledge and nominate 5 more.
1273003565267611648 2020-06-16 21:24:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Chad4short That sounds awesome! Thx for the share man. I’ll check it out online now.

1272310129266839552 2020-06-14 23:29:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs Following along here. Been wanting to try.

1272270843544891393 2020-06-14 20:53:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc @scottbsales I think the Lambda School model becomes more prevalent.
1272001368429965312 2020-06-14 03:02:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stephenrose1010 Unfortunately, nearly every minute that I'm not driving...
1271993278842302464 2020-06-14 02:30:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs Torchy's huh? Done.
1271993200236883968 2020-06-14 02:29:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP We're excited too, thanks, Amy!
1271972412230270977 2020-06-14 01:07:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rockyclark1 Thanks again, Rocky. hello@theofficialjustin.com
1271968146870566913 2020-06-14 00:50:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rockyclark1 Rocky, that would be amazing! Thank you for that. My wife and I love great food and good craft beer/cocktails. Feel free to hit me with your faves. I've never been to Alabama.

1271885354295943168 2020-06-13 19:21:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m @gaetano_nyc Not sure. Don’t know enough about it, to be honest.
1271879410849689600 2020-06-13 18:57:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc If you support the Confederacy, you are, in fact, a traitor to the United States of America.  https://t.co/5zxwfCMfSq
1271643517685837824 2020-06-13 03:20:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_DaveyRussell It sounds like an easy way to gain some poundage, but I'm super down.
1271638239829508096 2020-06-13 02:59:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_DaveyRussell Was literally next door to it all week. Didn’t order but will when I come back!
1271572798385860616 2020-06-12 22:39:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @magnusbilawal I hope so too :-)
1271541392096010242 2020-06-12 20:34:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Made one small bet this week.  Opened up one new revenue stream.   Doesn’t always work that way.   Always dip your toe in the water first.
1271193634067660807 2020-06-11 21:32:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP I vote yes.

1271187940740337665 2020-06-11 21:09:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc @ohpinion8ted Had a great time doing some debating...
1270924721576652801 2020-06-11 03:44:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SVMansuri @thescottleese You let your managers, directors, and ICs dictate how you hire departmental leaders? And how they get compensated?   That's a recipe for disaster.
1270897411465056260 2020-06-11 01:55:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SVMansuri @thescottleese Sahil - I’m curious how you might approach a situation where you have two options:  - a stretch VP comfortable with 4yr/1yr - a proven VP who wants milestone vesting allowing acceleration in 3 years by hitting stretch targets.   No tricks here. Just curious.
1270742040146575362 2020-06-10 15:38:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs I feel the same way about pods. If you must manufacture engagement then you're not doing something right.  It's also optimizing for the wrong outcome. It's not about engagement.   It's about end results.
1270741216422965251 2020-06-10 15:34:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> WeWork in East Nashville is empty as can be.   Great time to hammer out some content.   About to jump on a podcast with ⁦@gaetano_nyc⁩ and ⁦@ohpinion8ted⁩  https://t.co/FIIBNDtVgv

1270138050807562242 2020-06-08 23:38:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> PatientPop had a townhall today where our black employees spoke to the whole company.   It was simultaneously beautiful, moving, and uncomfortable.   I’m not sure I’ve ever learned more in 75 minutes.   I was moved to tears.   More of this, please.
1270053524207030276 2020-06-08 18:02:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mattragland I’m really excited, Matt. Thanks! Don’t know a single person here. Would be great to grab a drink sometime if you’re down.

1267108362392494082 2020-05-31 14:59:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm really proud of Seth Towns.   I'm really proud that he's a student-athlete at The Ohio State University.   This is what our future leaders look like.  💪🏻

1266083294019383296 2020-05-28 19:05:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kyleplacy @thescottleese @AvenueTP You'd better be there!
1265986603937193984 2020-05-28 12:41:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @thescottleese @AvenueTP @jamesbawden @morganjingram Thanks, Josh. Right back atcha.
1265786068671946752 2020-05-27 23:24:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegerhardt Gracias.
1265786000980099073 2020-05-27 23:24:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jchernov "I see that you work in internet."
1265784106987646978 2020-05-27 23:17:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegerhardt As a new podcast host, this is really helpful. Do you pre-plan questions or just ad-lib?
1265783786500796417 2020-05-27 23:15:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @morganjingram @gregorymsocial That's true. My response didn't exactly alleviate your problem. Don't work yourself to death, man. :) 🤗
1265782948067856384 2020-05-27 23:12:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki This is great advice. You have a few options, and one of them is to invest heavily in yourself.  The worst thing that happens is you fail, and a company sees your effort as bold initiative.
1265782594903240704 2020-05-27 23:11:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram @thescottleese @gregorymsocial Have u considered something other than Patreon?   Feels like it requires constant effort, above &amp; beyond what you already do on a regular basis.  Could create a 2-hour valuable course &amp; promote it for a year.   1 meaningful burst of content creation that lasts - just my 2 cents.
1265781430300246017 2020-05-27 23:06:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Getting fired 3x early in my career was a big blessing.   I learned, very quickly, that actions have consequences.   By learning that, I became a better professional, leader, and person.   I could not have built my business today, without those lessons from the past.
1265281665212968961 2020-05-26 14:00:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylesareus Damn't.
1265067786344095744 2020-05-25 23:50:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @christinaschim Can't wait to hear your feedback!
1265058797006938112 2020-05-25 23:14:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NathanLatka Shows you how the best in their craft have been consistent for many years...
1264301012757565440 2020-05-23 21:03:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @cjpattss @thescottleese Thanks dude!

1264271866916569088 2020-05-23 19:07:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffbajorek @TheJackieHermes I love Detroit. I lived in St. Claire Shores for a year back in the day. It’s experiencing a resurgence and I love that.
1264015895145246720 2020-05-23 02:10:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort Facebook, as a company, is irrelevant. It’s like asking how America Online is treating remote employees.   I don’t know a single person who would want to work there.  Remote work will be defined by companies that are significantly more nimble than some of these old giants.
1263976537696555008 2020-05-22 23:34:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffbajorek @TheJackieHermes Plus the crew there seems extremely creative. I love that.
1263976414107201536 2020-05-22 23:33:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @thescottleese @the1truederek As soon as one company is willing to pay SF rates to top talent in other cities...I feel like there's a domino effect. In the end, I don't care if my top performer is in NYC or Sioux City, Iowa.   What are your thoughts?
1263969121445658624 2020-05-22 23:04:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @the1truederek @brendanjshort I’m going Milwaukee, Nashville, Denver...somewhere.
1263969009705209856 2020-05-22 23:04:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheJackieHermes One of my top choices!
1263928574857248768 2020-05-22 20:23:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BradTonoff @dwilliamriggs @onepeloton is a game-changer.
1263927468068450304 2020-05-22 20:19:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort I don’t understand why this argument isn’t as simple as “pay the same for the same outcomes.”
1263925955778641920 2020-05-22 20:13:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @hustlesideofayo Glad you liked it, Ayo!
1263919670098198533 2020-05-22 19:48:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> COVID hot list:  - Multiple revenue streams - Planned exercise breaks  - States with low taxes - Reduced spending - The Midwest   My plan is to come outta this healthier and in even better financial shape.
1263672178756575235 2020-05-22 03:24:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo @naahrun I chortled.
1263667632718270464 2020-05-22 03:06:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo @naahrun Me: rye chip Wife: square pretzel   Square f****** pretzel??
1263663877503377408 2020-05-22 02:52:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @naahrun Thanks. Now my wife and I are in an argument.
1263638672215126016 2020-05-22 01:11:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc LA pretty nice my man.
1263617728675381249 2020-05-21 23:48:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> How could you NOT attend? 🍺
1263617675005054979 2020-05-21 23:48:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @AvenueTP @gaetano_nyc 489 son.
1263528837465337856 2020-05-21 17:55:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @justincardillo You’d think. People miss and then I get a note saying, “sorry man, I got caught in another meeting!”    When I charge? Always on time. Always there.
1263512981523927040 2020-05-21 16:52:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs Since they have very little experience, I would tell them to simply document their journeys...
1263504627137310720 2020-05-21 16:19:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TrentAnders0n All inbound or referral, yes.
1263480329211244550 2020-05-21 14:42:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana I've never had a free call turn into business. I second that, Jason.,
1263478788618321920 2020-05-21 14:36:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Charging for my consulting discovery call. An experiment:   1. Free discovery call: 40% show rate 2. $99 discovery call: 100% show rate  The lesson, as always, is that "skin in the game" is a better move for consultants or anyone that charges for their time.
1263278710473388032 2020-05-21 01:21:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Simplicity rules when it comes to brand monetization.  - So many complicated software products - So many "funnel hacking" tools - So many email nurture/drip marketing products  Build trust with your audience and serve them valuable products with a simple solution like @gumroad
1263261574216560640 2020-05-21 00:13:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc It really does. I get zero joy from it.
1263169186454355970 2020-05-20 18:06:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Block.
1263103047028183042 2020-05-20 13:43:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram 100%. Make an impact. Income follows.
1262929333674373120 2020-05-20 02:13:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelwolber @granthanson @gumroad Thanks, Mike!
1262928794924519425 2020-05-20 02:11:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelwolber @granthanson @gumroad Welp. That shows you just how much I know about Oregon. Interested. Researching now.
1262927320005787653 2020-05-20 02:05:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michaelwolber @granthanson @gumroad I absolutely love Oregon. PDX is my dream city, but rain is SO tough for me...how do you handle?
1262896923129925633 2020-05-20 00:04:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @thescottleese @kyletcoleman  https://t.co/QLh4YBOoTs
1262873037453455361 2020-05-19 22:29:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @fbourdeau @thescottleese @Josh_G_Roth @kyletcoleman Exactly. I didn't mean it in the context of me being someone special, just simply that nobody would respond to that :)
1262869830962536448 2020-05-19 22:16:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @Josh_G_Roth @kyletcoleman 10 minutes after I sent this, someone sent me their GTM strategy and asked me to review it and send feedback. I've never spoken or interacted with this person before. It's like I'm an assistant...
1262860799594213381 2020-05-19 21:40:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @Patreon Been considering using it for some time, but I can only commit once I have the free time. Looking fwd to that day.
1262850301624639488 2020-05-19 20:59:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @Josh_G_Roth @kyletcoleman I take a different approach. I ignore most messages because they haven't made a real effort to connect. They just connect and say "Hi, Look at my profile and give me feedback!".
1262792845557035009 2020-05-19 17:10:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @AvenueTP @gaetano_nyc @gaetano_nyc would I be out of bounds to request some Pearl Jam?
1262608479925067776 2020-05-19 04:58:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @elriclegloire @gumroad Don't love their response to COVID. what are your thoughts?
1262576923164545025 2020-05-19 02:52:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo @gumroad Done. appreciate the info 🙌🏻🙌🏻
1262576159855800320 2020-05-19 02:49:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo @gumroad FYI - I judged you.
1262576094219100161 2020-05-19 02:49:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo @gumroad Ok. That’s amazing. And you’re staying there? I’m interested in coming to visit MT
1262574208200015883 2020-05-19 02:42:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo @gumroad Wow. Damn. I’ve often thought about Missoula. I know nothing about Bozeman. What made you move there?
1262573259985305600 2020-05-19 02:38:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo @gumroad Tell me more. Where in Montana??
1262522617723936768 2020-05-18 23:17:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @granthanson @gumroad Original plan was CDMX. Was headed there but COVID messed it all up!
1262507867262730240 2020-05-18 22:18:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @gumroad It sure does...
1262507815580528645 2020-05-18 22:18:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_DaveyRussell @cjpattss @gumroad Been there once and couldn’t get a good feel for it. Need to def go again and check out East Nashville. Is that an area you would recommend?
1262507679559217152 2020-05-18 22:17:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @waitrewindthat @thescottleese @gumroad @morganjingram I’m thinking Atlanta definitely is in the running. Need to come explore. Good craft beer scene? 🙂
1262485523978833920 2020-05-18 20:49:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @gumroad Make the hotness stop.
1262485469108924417 2020-05-18 20:49:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryanlalllier @gumroad CA is killing me, dude:  37% federal 13.3% state 10.25% sales  Not to mention property taxes...it’s insane.
1262476969100210177 2020-05-18 20:15:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gumroad @dwilliamriggs @jasonvana Always.
1262476909583032320 2020-05-18 20:15:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamesbawden @gumroad I’m listening....:) I like what I hear. Tolerant?
1262476759192055809 2020-05-18 20:14:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs @jasonvana @gumroad I love Gumroad. Simple.

1262464890238676993 2020-05-18 19:27:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BradTonoff @gumroad @AdamSinger I love LA weather (and SO many other things about it). But the taxes are just unbearable. Utterly ridiculous.
1262464462222536704 2020-05-18 19:25:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @cjpattss @gumroad You had me until Reno. 😂 I’m looking even lower cost of living and smaller than these cities. New Hampshire is interesting. Also, seasons are key. PDX too rainy.
1262460031850516480 2020-05-18 19:08:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cjpattss @gumroad Doing research right now. Want lower cost of living, lower taxes, smaller...decent food scene. Tolerance. Any ideas?
1262457134970593281 2020-05-18 18:56:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My first months income on @gumroad is a nice second income stream in LA.   It could be a primary income stream in many other parts of the country.   Once COVID is over...I’m outta Cali.
1262204299464986626 2020-05-18 02:12:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Andreammusic Sell it in @gumroad ! 😃
1262200690060873733 2020-05-18 01:57:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo First time there. Left LA just for something new and stumbled upon that spot. Really delicious.
1262199122175483905 2020-05-18 01:51:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo 4th Horseman in Long Beach!
1262199052629708800 2020-05-18 01:51:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @sethschreiber Everything. All groceries, all food. Read a lot of stats today and finally felt safe to go out. (Safer)
1262198877093892097 2020-05-18 01:50:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Andreammusic 4th Horseman in Long Beach. Really good stuff. Enjoyed it and felt good giving to a small biz!
1262198658105106433 2020-05-18 01:49:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Andreammusic No no. Mask on!
1262198595521933312 2020-05-18 01:49:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort I’ve gone for walks and what not but I haven’t left my property in the car or anything. First time...
1262189560550707202 2020-05-18 01:13:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Got out of the house for the first time in 68 days today.   Mask on. Pizza eaten. Beer drank.  https://t.co/rs4658KLwE
1261884335637925889 2020-05-17 05:00:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Obama for the win tonight.
1261768083355516929 2020-05-16 21:18:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thedigitalmel Awesome! Thanks for grabbing it.
1261448030227742721 2020-05-16 00:07:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram Yet, you put ‘em all together and you still don’t have a WR as good as @Cantguardmike
1261397850493075457 2020-05-15 20:47:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lewisjkl 100%. Get the right data, in one system of record and combine that data with qualitative research. I find that many (not all) early-stage startups struggle just to get their hands on the right data. Fast forward 2 years and they are making critical decisions on bad data. Whoops.
1261340036932358144 2020-05-15 16:57:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese It's a pauper when it's garbage data.
1261325501383073794 2020-05-15 16:00:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> "The answer is always in the data" is ridiculous.   Most companies I work w/ have terrible data. They make decisions on a spreadsheet that some junior employee fills out with human error &amp; bias.  If you make decisions using only data, you'd better invest in it being excellent.
1261320517644021760 2020-05-15 15:40:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SchneiderKJ @AmandaMGoetz @BrianPBosche @mkobach @web @collincadmus @morganjingram @shl @ankurnagpal @racheltipograph @briannekimmel I’ll take being a part of this excellent group. Thanks, Keith!
1260739530933497856 2020-05-14 01:11:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc Shitty tacos is the worst. How does that happen? ❌🌮
1260687676199456768 2020-05-13 21:45:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs I would. Incentivize upfront payments with a discount and incentivize your reps to sell that.
1260638984624979971 2020-05-13 18:32:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @magnusbilawal When you lose many, do you know why?
1260638885253545984 2020-05-13 18:31:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs Quarterly NPS scores + sentiment analysis are super helpful.   Can you move your customers to monthly payments but annual contractual commitments?
1260625340956737536 2020-05-13 17:37:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> High churn annihilates every single piece of your business.   Execs, sales morale, onboarding, customer service, product team.   Everybody.   It’s literally company poison.

1260343871730417664 2020-05-12 22:59:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I have a favorite band and I buy anything they release, the day it comes out.   THAT is audience building.  Build even a small group that you interact with &amp; share joy with.  When the time is right - serve value &amp; ask them to participate in purchasing it.   Like my favorite band.
1260021870042083329 2020-05-12 01:39:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Candidly, your course applies to almost any social platform. The advice is very, very solid and actionable.

1260012671123910656 2020-05-12 01:03:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JakeTDunlap Exactly. Don’t wait, and instead...accelerate your own learning.
1259948426541715456 2020-05-11 20:48:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs @kyleplacy Thanks for listening, David!
1259922391393697792 2020-05-11 19:04:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @magnusbilawal Thanks, Ali! Own your development. Key to growth.
1259902327726592000 2020-05-11 17:44:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you’re waiting for your company to “develop” you, you’re likely going to be waiting awhile.   Take control.
1259886580556107776 2020-05-11 16:42:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Are you registered yet??
1259640050519703552 2020-05-11 00:22:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Instead of trying to fake your expertise in something, just be an expert in your own journey.   Teach people what YOU learned.   Sell you.   I’ll consume that.
1259631249896771585 2020-05-10 23:47:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegerhardt To me, it’s one of the most timeless articles. It’s as relevant today as it was when it was written.
1259582176837791744 2020-05-10 20:32:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In my first month, I'm pacing over $10,000.  And this is just my side hustle.  A few small changes = massive returns.  Next up? Expense reduction.   Then? Better investing.  Always growing. 📈  https://t.co/0pTOvT7lmP
1259582175826989057 2020-05-10 20:32:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A year ago I cut bullshit news &amp; politics from my life.  Started following people like @CJ_Johnson17th &amp; dug into his methodology. Grabbed his courses.  Then, I documented how I went from zero to 38,000 followers on LinkedIn and dropped it on @Gumroad.  What happened?👇🏻

1259320372068970497 2020-05-10 03:12:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth I gained 15 just eating 10 of them.
1259318817404026880 2020-05-10 03:06:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth I just gained 17 lbs.
1259317996016697344 2020-05-10 03:03:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Eff. My wife learned to make donuts.   😧  https://t.co/kgVzADjqFp
1259288060396662784 2020-05-10 01:04:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IsaiahAscher @LinkedIn Nice, Isaiah! Looking forward to your feedback and seeing you grow, man.
1259272052692840449 2020-05-10 00:00:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese I can sell ZocDoc or PatientPop with one eye open.
1259198674971709440 2020-05-09 19:08:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jamesbawden Tough for everyone. The moment you realize that you can accept some blame, you also realize you can attack the upside in life. It's SO freeing. I agree.
1259141480829956097 2020-05-09 15:21:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SMCPT They also don't believe that they have any control...so that ends up being true.
1259128617847492609 2020-05-09 14:30:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A big surprise to me is how many people rage when you suggest they have control over their own lives.
1258931499199430656 2020-05-09 01:27:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc @TODAYshow @nbc This is AMAZING.
1258760340541632513 2020-05-08 14:07:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @OldManChad_ Glad you liked it, Chad.
1258754376354545664 2020-05-08 13:43:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The internet has democratized earnings potential.   Anyone, whether they are 18 or 81 can transform their financial situation by building an audience.  No, it's not easy, but good things rarely are. The fact that it's possible is what matters.  Start today by just documenting...
1258741383042461696 2020-05-08 12:51:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MuhammadWahajk Exactly.

1258520122928427008 2020-05-07 22:12:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DennisDemori @realjoepirro When you’re building an audience, this is the strategy that’s worked for me. I have multiple audiences in multiple phases of growth, gives and asks.
1258509109369769984 2020-05-07 21:28:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BuiltNolan @tylerwdwyer Damn right. But you need to want some money off of your hard work at some point. That just allows you to serve more.
1258508918830952449 2020-05-07 21:28:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek Just LinkedIn.
1258507782283595778 2020-05-07 21:23:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everybody saying, "Don't sell on social media" has never sold on social media.   Do your thing💰  https://t.co/VD5RsIMbUa
1258477758012813312 2020-05-07 19:24:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SchneiderKJ Thanks, Keith. I need this reminder every week...
1258473698043899905 2020-05-07 19:08:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Always play the long game.   What that doesn't mean, however, is to let people take advantage of you in the short term.  Know your value. Know your worth.  Don't budge.
1258231792424726528 2020-05-07 03:06:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @4NIKKOLAS @ArlanWasHere Wow. Incredibly impressive.
1258231021322989568 2020-05-07 03:03:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs Love documentaries. You know title? I just watched the series Unorthodox. Was incredible.
1258226564400951298 2020-05-07 02:46:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Oh man. I've been watching some great movies during COVID.   Revisited Jurassic Park tonight. I was 12 when it came out.   Feel likes it holds up 100%
1258168337890078720 2020-05-06 22:54:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dwilliamriggs Yep. It's great to find content that inspires you. Never steal, just use it as inspiration.
1258168215936491520 2020-05-06 22:54:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lady_jecca Awesome, glad you enjoyed it, Jessica. Thanks for coming.
1258156087259381764 2020-05-06 22:06:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Want an easy way to improve your life?   Find 1 hour you waste every week doing the following:  Netflix Boozing Smoking Watching YouTube  Turn that time into:  Practicing a skill Writing a blog post Recording a podcast Building an online course Going to a virtual networking event
1257703606410772481 2020-05-05 16:08:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The catalyst to my big, sweeping change in life was acknowledgment.   We're moving so fast that we rarely take the time to acknowledge our satisfaction level with our current routine.  Everyone talks about change.   Acknowledgment, for me, was a powerful step one.
1257494226230788098 2020-05-05 02:16:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are 42 million minutes in the average human lifespan.  Look at your calendar &amp; be honest with yourself. What should you cancel? What should you outsource? What should you automate with software?  Wealth is about maximizing productivity while minimizing time-based effort.
1257462919836708864 2020-05-05 00:11:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TommyTahoe @NathanLatka @samfjacobs Thanks, Tom. They get better over time...I'm a harsh self-critic.
1257460910190407680 2020-05-05 00:03:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NathanLatka I've been a guest 50+ times. First time as a host? Surprising how challenging it can be to find your voice, rhythm, etc. This is definitely good advice.
1257388371829293057 2020-05-04 19:15:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HackItMax 👈🏻   Waiting for that really handsome guy who is going to talk about personal branding in a few days...

1257309034836705280 2020-05-04 14:00:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> This week, 1% of people will use their iPhone for:  ‣ Learning ‣ Building a brand ‣ Connecting w/ smart people ‣ Creating products and services  99% of people will use it to:  ‣ Buy stuff ‣ Binge Netflix ‣ Argue politics ‣ Complain ab life  Think about that.  ✌🏻

1257004451782463489 2020-05-03 17:49:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Been following along and just did $5,100 in my first 2 weeks on @gumroad. I made my course affordable, accessible, and robust. Thanks for the push.
1256620102172065797 2020-05-02 16:22:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit When you read things like this, what’s your first instinctual advice? Diversify income? Reduce expenses? Better investments? All of the above?
1256304128826830848 2020-05-01 19:26:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP Very infrequently do people “deserve” a VP role. You are granted the opportunity and must succeed in order to stay employed.
1256301867606237184 2020-05-01 19:18:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @snesareva But, if you don't wake up one day and get started, it never happens. But, your points are very valid.
1256301615167860738 2020-05-01 19:17:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I sold $1,768 in courses yesterday.  1. Posted on LinkedIn at 6am. Picked up momentum  2. Use @getshieldapp to see when momentum is gone (1pm)  3. 2nd post at 1pm w/ a screenshot of testimonials ab my course + URL.  Results: Siphoned momentum &amp; made 29 sales + 2 coaching blocks.  https://t.co/ukHgL6i1YB
1256296409063518209 2020-05-01 18:56:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ZadrazilRyan Oh, 100%. I think people don't start because they don't know how...It's not as hard as one might think. Just follow the steps.
1256294843778625536 2020-05-01 18:50:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Want to start a side hustle?   Here's what works:  - Work toward achieving something - Document the whole journey - Write about your progress - Tie it into a course/book - Share w/ your audience  What doesn't?  - Worrying about "expertise" - Not sharing the journey - Not starting
1256008780761853952 2020-04-30 23:53:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CJ_Johnson17th Have a plan. Get started. Be consistent.  Age not required.
1255859846521352194 2020-04-30 14:01:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CJ_Johnson17th Stocks are on sale right now. I'm buying.
1255848760539660289 2020-04-30 13:17:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Building a personal brand isn't about expertise.  Just get started learning something you truly are interested in.   Then:  - Document the process - Aggregate your learnings - Share your wins &amp; losses w/ others  People want to follow your journey.   That's what it's all about.
1255682726503395329 2020-04-30 02:17:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram @thescottleese @pereusfrance @Josh_G_Roth @scottbsales I’m hustling to move cross-platform.
1255644245899149312 2020-04-29 23:44:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ohpinion8ted @jeffbajorek I think we’re saying something similar. Content creates fans but I believe lead magnets tend to attempt to shortcut that process. Download. BANG. 15 emails over 15 days. Forget that. I’d rather read one tweet per day for 15 days then buy.
1255528731386527744 2020-04-29 16:05:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Growing wealth is about getting creative.  Every time you make a $1, ask yourself:  "Where can I put this dollar to make another dollar?"   Things like:  - Real estate - side project - stock market - learning a skill - Getting coached  Not like:  - shoes - clothes - video games
1255520418007482368 2020-04-29 15:32:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BurkeWriter @yoast @HubSpot @danmartell I can appreciate that. It's not how I buy, so I tend to follow the path that I, myself, would be influenced by. So...no more magnets and email nurtures.
1255503432225566720 2020-04-29 14:25:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Savage_Woodss @CJ_Johnson17th @gumroad @etrade 1. I make money consulting 2. Invest in my side hustle 3. She invests the side hustle income in stock market  #teamwork 🔥
1255498565025218563 2020-04-29 14:05:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MideRoyalty 💯 magnets are old school.  Tribe creation is new school.
1255497929877524486 2020-04-29 14:03:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @CJ_Johnson17th I just took the $2,500 I made from @gumroad, passed it to my wife, she invested it via @etrade and doubled it in 48 hours.   Money making money.
1255493063029514240 2020-04-29 13:44:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit @Jonherrington You can buy as many $3 lattes as you want if you pay yourself first...Love this.
1255483545839185921 2020-04-29 13:06:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jeffbajorek @ohpinion8ted I understand intent and I understand that not everyone who downloads a lead magnet will convert into a sale...just like each cold call.  IMO, the lead magnet to email funnel will only get worse over time as buyers get funnel fatigue. It's already happening.  Fans buy.
1255331954154770432 2020-04-29 03:03:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BurkeWriter Have you ever been nurtured via email to a purchase?
1255311962206097408 2020-04-29 01:44:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc @gaetano_nyc to add context, I've scrapped reading the books &amp; following best practices.  I've started to recreate the buyer's journey I've followed to purchase products.   It's been eye-opening. I'd love to learn what's working for you as I hold you in extremely high regard.
1255311352643584000 2020-04-29 01:42:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc Branding + credibility is focused on eventually turning prospects into customers though, no?   I just haven't made my way through a funnel or to a purchase by starting with a magnet.   On the flip side, I'll buy ANYTHING some people put out.   Their content nurtured me. Thoughts?
1255301238972985345 2020-04-29 01:01:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jbplat Thanks, Jim! When I take a step back and think about how I purchase things...it just becomes so obvious what the catalyst is.   I buy info products like I buy albums. I become a fan and wait for the release...  Email nurtures? Nah.
1255293242171633668 2020-04-29 00:30:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Lead magnets don't work.   I've downloaded 500+ ebooks, whitepapers, case studies, &amp; infographics.   Never bought a thing.   I've purchased 2 things online and they were from people I followed for months and loved their content.  Build fans. Not email campaigns.
1255226461432229892 2020-04-28 20:04:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m Thanks, Mike! Learning a ton every day and just trying to put it all out there.
1255214819013206018 2020-04-28 19:18:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Making money is NOT about your product.   It's about your audience.   Stop building that website. Put down the online course software. Pick up a copywriting book &amp; learn to tell compelling stories.  Stories ==&gt; Audience ==&gt; product
1255163292512706562 2020-04-28 15:53:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @supriya_85 @Gumroad for selling products and @Etrade for stocks...
1255142827106775040 2020-04-28 14:32:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Wealth creation cycle:  - Make money at your job. - Invest in your side hustle. - Make more money with that money.  Starting 2 months ago, I've deposited every dime from my side hustle into dividend-paying stocks.   That money is making more money.  The cycle continues.  https://t.co/T1P7AhE9UC
1254930787880689664 2020-04-28 00:29:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley THAT is funny.
1254924048984768512 2020-04-28 00:03:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I love hiring people with side hustles.  Don't focus on the distraction you envision. Focus on the motivation built into that person.   You want that. Trust me.
1254837961901793280 2020-04-27 18:20:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @Daniela_Boricua Connected with her. Thanks for the recommendation, Scott.
1254837847485329408 2020-04-27 18:20:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cvonhuene Thanks, Chris. It's much more digestible when you break it down this way.
1254100846951841792 2020-04-25 17:31:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @elriclegloire Don't use in copy of post. Significant decrease. I can't track comments vs CTA but anecdotally, the CTA seems to have driven more.
1254069493204004864 2020-04-25 15:27:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Motivation in sales.  How much is natural, and how much can be built? I dove into that and more on the Modern Sales Podcast.  Check it out here:   https://t.co/nVOMe8PcAB  https://t.co/ZOnBNi3t8b
1253845409639706624 2020-04-25 00:36:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @paulsalamanca Thanks, Paul. Have you been experimenting with the featured section CTA yet?
1253828555554697217 2020-04-24 23:29:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @magnusbilawal Thanks, Ali. It's been a lot of fun to experiment with the feature. Have you been using it at all?
1253818265664544768 2020-04-24 22:49:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The new LinkedIn CTA drives revenue.   Takeaways:  - With good reach, it's pretty easy to drive sales. - Posts are worth ab 4.3 sales @ $50 ACV - Live broadcasts convert ab 4.7% of attendees.   Daily posting + 1/wk live broadcasts should produce bt $1,500 &amp; $2,000 in revenue.  https://t.co/I3uhPuX7JJ

1253465355642531840 2020-04-23 23:26:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Part of branding is understanding your expertise.  We're all experts in something.

1252799220639096832 2020-04-22 03:19:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @M_Gagliano @amarjoshi112 Lots of experiments with LinkedIn CTA. Some experiments with Twitter. Always trying to understand conversion rates.
1252799022844112896 2020-04-22 03:18:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @M_Gagliano @contraocoronga @gumroad From 2,500 to 35,000 was about 14 months.
1252776830290952192 2020-04-22 01:50:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My personal network is amazing.   From finding my friends jobs, to working together on content, to simply supporting the heck out of each other...  Wow. I’m lucky and speechless.
1252668295129395200 2020-04-21 18:39:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @contraocoronga Right now, it's all profit. I've built an organic following on LinkedIn (~35,000) and when I post, I make sales naturally. The only expense is my monthly @gumroad membership ($10) and my time...
1252666421189816320 2020-04-21 18:32:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @amarjoshi112 Far from the revenue we want as a family, but we each are consultants making a full-time income. This money? Easy way to bring retirement closer.   Just had a $1,000 week experimenting. Ya know?
1252665565719621633 2020-04-21 18:28:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've been thinking about 6-figure info products w/ my wife:  - $50 product - 3 daily sales - $300 total rev between 2 people  $109,500 in revenue.  Much easier when you break it down like that.
1252630931921268739 2020-04-21 16:11:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m Thanks, Mike. I appreciate that!
1252596291768479745 2020-04-21 13:53:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonvana 100%. They don't think through a strategy...
1252400263547088899 2020-04-21 00:54:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3 reasons why personal branding gets sh*t on:  1. It can come off as self-serving even though the net impact is massively in favor of others.  2. It makes people uncomfortable to see you promoting. Discomfort spawns anger.   3. It's hard and people don't like to see you succeed.
1252398805518958592 2020-04-21 00:48:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek @pmarca The controversial part was that it required Americans to accept responsibility rather than to blame. Today's America is rather cyclical in nature. Left blaming right, right blaming left. Around and around it goes. Anything outside of that blame cycle is nearly inconceivable.
1252287579853996035 2020-04-20 17:26:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese and I will be talking personal branding on Thursday with @JakeTDunlap &amp; the @Skaled team. Come join us!
1252264499765063680 2020-04-20 15:54:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ErnestLehti @gumroad Awesome, glad you picked it up, Ernest.
1252245247645462529 2020-04-20 14:38:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SchneiderKJ You can definitely do that, but (maybe unfortunately?) polarizing works. Everything that we click on or interact with tends to provoke SOME emotion. Polarizing doesn't necessarily mean agree/disagree.
1252220877313208320 2020-04-20 13:01:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IMaddalozzo Enjoy, Italo! Hope you love it.
1252072948942266368 2020-04-20 03:13:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese 😂 I know you do homie.
1252054342485434369 2020-04-20 01:59:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You’re personal branding wrong.   You can’t be middle of the road. Lame. Boring.   You can’t be crazy. Saying stuff that doesn’t make sense.   Be polarizing.  65/35 agreement/disagreement.   Maybe 60/40.
1252001135717576704 2020-04-19 22:28:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rogerdickey Consuming and creating. Reading books, reading blogs, creating content, creating products. As much as I hate being stuck inside, it's forcing me into some decent habits I hope to keep.

1251680540391960577 2020-04-19 01:14:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @thescottleese Jordan was next level. Enjoyed hurting people’s spirits. As a Cavs fans...I would know.
1251677490851876865 2020-04-19 01:02:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @Josh_G_Roth I love Kobe. Anyone picking him over MJ...nah.

1251670067617488896 2020-04-19 00:32:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JakeTDunlap @GalemGirmay Skills pay the bills. 💰
1251622782204440576 2020-04-18 21:24:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m @catalystsale Same here. That exercise is critical. Hyper niche is where it’s at.
1251622092363034624 2020-04-18 21:22:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m @catalystsale Nailing it, Mike. Clarity is the key IMO. I've gone from nebulous to crystal clear lately and the results have shown.
1251617562011426817 2020-04-18 21:04:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Simple personal branding tip.  Cut "cute" language. Tell your audience the following👇🏻  - Who are you? - Who do you help? - What do you help them do? - How do they start working with you?  Fluff confuses. Clarity sells.
1251598480956510208 2020-04-18 19:48:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imbayoojo Yep.   1. Someone should follow me bc of X 2. I will only post about X, Y &amp; Z
1251508724054675456 2020-04-18 13:51:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @imbayoojo It took me about 12 months to build my LinkedIn following to be able to generate that daily. It's worth building though.
1251336799181369344 2020-04-18 02:28:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Klee_FilmReview Dear Zachary
1251327573746827265 2020-04-18 01:51:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort Yep. Same product. Different post, style and announcement.
1251291916651511811 2020-04-17 23:30:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @elriclegloire Yep - I'm learning a bit more each day how to use it effectively. Think it's a game-changer for anyone running their own business.
1251272898725068801 2020-04-17 22:14:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The end sales results:  - 3 purchases - 2 paid - $150 in revenue   2 day total is $450 for 2 LinkedIn posts with no ad spend.  Takeaways:   - Less success today because the post was motivational vs. tactical action steps. - Weaker CTA on my LI post drove fewer visitors.  https://t.co/RiJQtiCrlk
1251272897030615041 2020-04-17 22:14:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Drove 21 visitors to my Gumroad page:  - 6.3% of those who engaged - 21% of those who interacted  This is about half of what I drove yesterday. I have a few thoughts in the summary...  https://t.co/WOMsmkCedy
1251272895134699520 2020-04-17 22:14:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Day 2 experimenting with the new CTA on LinkedIn:  - 28,742 views - 336 engagements - 105 interactions  Conversion &amp; sales results 👇🏻  https://t.co/bt0U7L6T7K

1250931795312259072 2020-04-16 23:39:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shibasish4 I post 1x per day in the AM (6a)
1250904559678980096 2020-04-16 21:51:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek It's very attainable. I think people don't stop and break down the math enough. I just made sale #4. That's $300 on the day. That's $109,500 on the year...It takes time to build an audience, but it's so worth it.   And the day isn't over.
1250904234905661440 2020-04-16 21:49:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BradTonoff I'm seeing a lot of people in roles that hid in their teams or behind projects. With cost-cutting measures coming, CEOs are starting to ask, "What did this person/team accomplish that's tangible?". If you can't point to something...ehh...bad news.
1250896238913785856 2020-04-16 21:17:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ryancarson Absolutely.   Try @DrinkPartake , @AthleticBrewing &amp; @WellBeing_Brew. Will help you change the game up.
1250894047465533442 2020-04-16 21:09:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> COVID is exposing a lot of fluff roles in tech.   True needle-movers are having a moment.
1250879860358037504 2020-04-16 20:12:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Of the 58 who visited the product page, 3 purchased.  That's a 5.2% conversion rate.  $225 earned with one post.  If I had this luck each day, it would yield ~$82k per year.  Lots of learnings to unpack.  https://t.co/XNmHa3e4NE
1250879859435335680 2020-04-16 20:12:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Of the 473 people that engaged...  58 visited my @gumroad product page.  - That's about 12.3%  https://t.co/1bzdrWCib5
1250879857870831616 2020-04-16 20:12:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> LinkedIn's new "featured" CTA ain't half bad.  Wrote a post today about common mistakes on LinkedIn profiles and here are the results:  - 46,369 views - 473 engagements  But, the interesting thing is how that translated to traffic and sales.  https://t.co/kZhVGp5HxD
1250814779867815937 2020-04-16 15:54:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rcsomrak22 @salesforce + @outreach_io + @chilipiper
1250798949989969920 2020-04-16 14:51:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gabevillamizar Congrats, man. Huge round. Cheers 🙌
1250798286832689158 2020-04-16 14:48:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Sales leaders make it too complicated.   • Hire well • Train well • Coach well • Simple tech stack  The amount of sh*t you're buying because of FOMO...🤷‍♂️
1250770841991696386 2020-04-16 12:59:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BradTonoff @Vanguard_Group That's actually my irritation. It's not about predicting the virus. Of course, I wouldn't expect that from any firm. It's more their U/X. When I want to move money around it's like being on Compuserve in 1997.
1250587249713930240 2020-04-16 00:50:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cdorsey04 @Vanguard_Group @PersonalCapital Interesting, Chris. I used their software about 7 years ago but haven't since. Maybe I'll give them a holler. Thanks, man.
1250555429463052289 2020-04-15 22:43:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @chrishort_on What types of deals do you mostly work on? Any particular industry? Any dollar size?
1250542456380116992 2020-04-15 21:52:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JedCollins45 @TommyTahoe @Vanguard_Group I'm looking to move all of my money to someone who I have direct access to (I'm not sure if that answered your question). I used to have a wealth manager, but decided Vanguard had better rates. Have been really frustrated with the service and now looking to move back to advisor.
1250514429612982272 2020-04-15 20:00:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TommyTahoe @Vanguard_Group @JedCollins45 Thanks, Tom!
1250496244981456896 2020-04-15 18:48:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @Vanguard_Group @Betterment Interesting. I want to learn more. I know we have a chat coming up. Let's discuss!
1250484886269378561 2020-04-15 18:03:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek It's likely either #1 and they aren't trained on rejection or #3 and the process is broken. Just my guesses.
1250481438027214848 2020-04-15 17:49:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HackItMax Congrats, @HackItMax and team @outreach_io!
1250469672828329990 2020-04-15 17:02:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Really interesting. Thanks, Daniel.
1250468265580621824 2020-04-15 16:57:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Anything, in particular, you attribute this to?  Curious your takeaways, outside of Reddit simply outperforms.
1250462955893698562 2020-04-15 16:36:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit Did this at 24 when I was $30k in debt. Paid it off in a few years with some rigid behavior. Best move.
1250460362903670784 2020-04-15 16:25:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndyCabistan @Vanguard_Group @Wealthfront @RobinhoodApp Thanks, Andy. Looking for a personal investor but @Wealthfront looks really nice...perhaps better than wealthsimple which I use a bit.
1250436882799816704 2020-04-15 14:52:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jbplat Awesome, Jim. Glad you found it helpful. Most of the patterns of brand building can be applied across a variety of jobs/industries. Good luck!
1250265419811672064 2020-04-15 03:31:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TrentAnders0n @ScottAdamsSays And, to be clear, I love bumps from popular accounts. I try and impact as many people as possible on sites where I have some clout (LinkedIn) - but, again, when their content is solid and solves problems. Just my two cents.
1250264939123466246 2020-04-15 03:29:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TrentAnders0n @ScottAdamsSays I don't know that there's a specific definition (could be). I think what I'm trying to get across is that people focus on the outcome and get disappointed. Instead, focus on creating stuff that solves people's problems and you'll likely double your chances.
1250243493580042240 2020-04-15 02:04:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don't focus your personal brand on "viral content".  Instead: what's a problem you know how to solve?  Create content for that. If the advice is sound. If it's authentic.  Virality will come.   Be consistent. Be patient. Chip away. Incremental growth.  Tortoise vs. Hare
1250242516403630081 2020-04-15 02:00:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP @garyvee @EmpathyWines Enjoyed the rose, the white was a good change from New Zealand Sauv Blanc I usually drink, the red was too heavy (I'm a pinot drinker). All in all a good experience!
1250167000753569792 2020-04-14 21:00:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Making moves :)
1250127569514422272 2020-04-14 18:23:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Suggestions for your brand focus:  1. What do you like talking about? For free, for hours? Start there.  2. Niche. Who do you want to talk to? Who is looking for help? Aim at them.  3. Keep it specific. Not "sales".   Mine:  Who: salespeople What: brand building Why: increase 💵
1250066957526843395 2020-04-14 14:22:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @law4 Hell yeah. Can't wait. 🙌
1250062084643192832 2020-04-14 14:03:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram Old school or facetime? :)
1250061311641366529 2020-04-14 14:00:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SMCPT Thanks, Scott. I watch too many people make this mistake. Then...you have to start all over.
1250060246049005569 2020-04-14 13:56:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you’re brand building, make it about yourself, not the company you work for.   Lots of people spend years building for their prospects.   Then, suddenly they lose their job.   Building your brand for you means you can take it with you wherever you go.
1250048670382403584 2020-04-14 13:10:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're here visiting from LinkedIn, come on in.   Looking forward to interacting ✌🏻
1249881311763820545 2020-04-14 02:05:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort I also guess that didn't really answer your question, but I'd love to learn more about what you mean.
1249880436853047306 2020-04-14 02:01:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort I think there needs to be a cleansing of lots of practices that we see, like some of the ones I mentioned, plus others like webinars that don’t actually share information I.e. commercials. People will cease to provide email addresses. Gated content will go away.
1249877029266194432 2020-04-14 01:48:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @mikeyebio I think it will apply there too, Mike. I think people are tired of going through funnels and receiving emails each day. Tiring.
1249864437030248449 2020-04-14 00:57:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @morganjingram @masterclass I'm just consuming and creating on repeat. Gotta add Masterclass to my mix.
1249863350340575233 2020-04-14 00:53:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ZEEMZILLA @CJ_Johnson17th Invest. Compound interest. Dividends. Repeat.
1249862731819175941 2020-04-14 00:51:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @joserosado Just got done talking about this with a friend. People buy from those they trust. Trust comes from providing help...giving guidance. Love this.
1249859442016784384 2020-04-14 00:38:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Email sequences, no matter how good, always come across as disingenuous.   Adding value each day through Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.   That's where I'm most likely to build a relationship.
1249859167667367936 2020-04-14 00:37:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm convinced that ads &gt; squeeze page &gt; email sequences is dying.  I've entered hundreds of funnels, read thousands of emails and purchased nothing. Zero.   I've purchased 2 items, and it's bc of the trust those people built through social.  Social content is where it's at.
1249775285920100362 2020-04-13 19:03:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @AvenueTP Nailed it. I'm kind, but firm in my response. I spend 1,000+ hours per year creating free content :)
1249764498979713026 2020-04-13 18:20:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @AvenueTP My template:  "Thanks for reaching out, NAME. I’m attaching my menu of coaching services here - if those are in the ballpark, grab one, and we can hop on a Zoom call to chat through your situation in more detail. Sounds like something we could solve working together."
1249754804760403973 2020-04-13 17:42:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP People I don't know reach out to me every day and just say, "Hey - I'd like to get 30 minutes of your time so you can teach me X. Book some time with me here."   When I reply back that I charge for my time, they act insulted. My time IS my business.

1249168064404492299 2020-04-12 02:50:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @dvassallo I’ll ping you on LI.
1249167223719157760 2020-04-12 02:47:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_harryhurst Give it 30 days.
1249167025584422919 2020-04-12 02:46:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jason Bloated. And tired.
1249166951974305793 2020-04-12 02:46:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @dvassallo Def man. Let’s do a Zoom happy hour soon? 🍺
1249166778518945795 2020-04-12 02:45:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_harryhurst Mobile and desktop work exactly the same. There is no tag or snooze. You push to pre-defined times when you timebox emails. I check email only 2x per day now. I’d highly recommend giving it a shot. Just my two cents.
1249166313894948864 2020-04-12 02:43:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @dvassallo Just signed up for substack to share per your recommendation. Have a whole career shift coming up. Not too worried about the bomb to be honest. I’m a chameleon in interesting times 😁
1249165739325640705 2020-04-12 02:41:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_harryhurst Totally hear you. My unread was always my to-do. Superhuman allowed me to triage to times when I could actually do them vs. stacking up as a to-do list without assigned times. Anyways, been enjoying it more and more as I learn to use it.
1249164730415157262 2020-04-12 02:37:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_harryhurst Superhuman has been a game changer for me. Don’t like it?
1249164469294501888 2020-04-12 02:36:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @dvassallo Time Freedom, family, self-employment, happiness...could be interesting. Could bomb.
1249157503633547264 2020-04-12 02:08:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brendanjshort @dvassallo Brendan, I’m about to change it all up. Candidly...I’m sick of talking sales, SaaS, startups, etc. and have some thoughts on topics that are more meaningful to me.
1249123342021464064 2020-04-11 23:53:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Its_Jenn_Here @garyvee @EmpathyWines @TeamGaryVee Yes. Def.

1249095758764097536 2020-04-11 22:03:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Awesome. I’ve mastered LinkedIn but am still learning Twitter. You’re the #1 guy I read for advice. Looking forward to this.
1249095347046977537 2020-04-11 22:01:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @EmpathyWines @TommyTahoe @garyvee I’ll be pouring in about 2 hours. Stay tuned.
1249084898968657920 2020-04-11 21:20:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MCellarsOhio @garyvee @EmpathyWines Haven’t had them yet. Gonna try some tonight!
1249075048826060800 2020-04-11 20:41:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Finally gave into @garyvee and grabbed some @EmpathyWines   Can’t wait to break ‘em out tonight. 🙌🏻  https://t.co/sOH0csJcK3

1248259633061347328 2020-04-09 14:41:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit One of the most game-changing skills I ever learned. Great to see this happening, Ramit.
1248250376836399106 2020-04-09 14:04:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rmcgahen @StacyZapar Yep, the folks over at @outreach_io actually put together a whole job board:   https://t.co/t3QA2rI8QG
1248072348902625281 2020-04-09 02:16:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NaithanJones On it! Thx.
1248071727130628096 2020-04-09 02:14:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NaithanJones I wish I knew what that meant 🤦‍♂️ That’s on me. Off to research!
1248070647957188608 2020-04-09 02:10:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NaithanJones I love RZA yet I have no idea what this is referencing. My 90s hip hop is not keeping up with the 2020 times.
1248069992253288448 2020-04-09 02:07:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BrentBeshore This is absolutely the thing I needed to see tonight. Thank you.
1248040054875762690 2020-04-09 00:08:31 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If your friends or fmr. colleagues have lost their jobs, here are 2 things you can do in 10 minutes:  1. Write a short letter of recommendation or LinkedIn rec.  2. Make one intro to a leader or exec that you know is hiring  We're all busy, but let's lift our friends up.
1247732918878797826 2020-04-08 03:48:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @DoorDash It’s getting crazy. I’ve had full delivery orders, half delivery orders and just straight up theft.
1247660006356336640 2020-04-07 22:58:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Gong_io is just killing it with their content and I truly enjoyed moderating this panel of incredible sales leaders today.  https://t.co/N0ihzdm9zW
1247657078950260741 2020-04-07 22:46:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarryStebbings @onepeloton @MrVelvet @lessin @Nussenbaum @RobinNYC Robin Arzon (who I shared previously) and @jesskingnyc are amazing instructors.
1247656868433944576 2020-04-07 22:45:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarryStebbings @onepeloton @MrVelvet @lessin @Nussenbaum @RobinNYC 1. Getting the seat position right is key. Keep shifting until you feel really comfortable.  2. Stay at the lower end of the resistance recommendations unless you're a world-class athlete.  3. The "Live DJ" classes are a blast.   4. Start slow on each class - they get HARD.
1247650972236537863 2020-04-07 22:22:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarryStebbings @onepeloton @MrVelvet @lessin @Nussenbaum Might I recommend riding to the songs, style and motivation of @RobinNYC? She is an absolutely amazing instructor.
1247650293669449729 2020-04-07 22:19:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> There are so many things to be upset or scared by at this moment.  But, don't forget that an incredible amount of heroes and leaders will emerge from this time.
1247650024122535937 2020-04-07 22:18:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Amazing. Guy gets a ton of shit, but this is a big move. Props.

1247158152346267648 2020-04-06 13:44:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Are your deals starting to stall?   Slowing down a bit? Lost?   I'll be working with the @Gong_io team to moderate a panel of incredible sales leaders who are moving deals forward.  Tomorrow.   10am PT.    https://t.co/Cp9E1UybW5

1246210976690483200 2020-04-03 23:00:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit Thanks for the helpful response!
1246174028944920576 2020-04-03 20:33:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ramit I'm pushing a ton of money into the market now for long term gains. Right move?
1245902768897839105 2020-04-03 02:35:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk Dover or Maxwell beach in Barbados.
1245875774021754881 2020-04-03 00:48:26 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The same people that mocked COVID three weeks ago are the same people mocking climate change right now. 🤷‍♂️
1245749319761711104 2020-04-02 16:25:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @GalemGirmay @morganjingram Hope You enjoy it!

1245407118477291520 2020-04-01 17:46:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP @thescottleese As it should have been!
1245407059488559107 2020-04-01 17:45:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @AvenueTP Woah! I couldn’t think of a better co-host to step in than @AvenueTP. Gonna be awesome.
1245394952063815681 2020-04-01 16:57:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @garyvee Empathy &gt; fear.

1245077490831253504 2020-03-31 19:56:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I’m so damn COVID ready with ⁦@MargerumWine⁩  Bring it on.  https://t.co/cct6JxTLV5
1244633191161315332 2020-03-30 14:30:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk 15+ here. Keeping our customers happy but also understanding the messaging, talk tracks, etc. that are resonating right now. Using that to better speak to prospects.
1243741990270799872 2020-03-28 03:29:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheOutvoted @Crypto_Blurbs @C4liCrypto @kenklippenstein Significantly more. But that’s my choice my man.
1243741870473150464 2020-03-28 03:29:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheOutvoted @Crypto_Blurbs @C4liCrypto @kenklippenstein They STILL get skewered. Bill Gates has spent his whole life dedicated to philanthropy and gets crushed because he has money. I’m just tired of all of the blaming. Let’s put an end to it.
1243741483976380417 2020-03-28 03:27:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheOutvoted @Crypto_Blurbs @C4liCrypto @kenklippenstein I’m not ignoring the question. If I had 55 billion dollars (liquid - which I don’t and neither does he) I’d give away WAY more. I’m philanthropic by nature. But just because I would doesn’t mean that he has to. And when rich people DO give away way more...
1243741111857770496 2020-03-28 03:26:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheOutvoted @Crypto_Blurbs @C4liCrypto @kenklippenstein Its literally the WHOLE factor. You can’t give away what you don’t have liquid access to. Zuck is rich but he doesn’t owe anyone his money. None of us do. I don’t love the guy but I don’t hate this part of him.
1243740101257003009 2020-03-28 03:22:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Crypto_Blurbs @TheOutvoted @C4liCrypto @kenklippenstein Of course they are, but why let facts get in the way of a good shitting on success?
1243726856643198977 2020-03-28 02:29:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheOutvoted @C4liCrypto @kenklippenstein Imagine living in a system where you could exchange nearly anything...hard work, ideas, execution, etc. for currency. But...ya know..Sit around on Twitter and judge people giving their money to charity.
1243726433182265344 2020-03-28 02:27:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kenklippenstein You should be ashamed for this overly simplistic view of someone's net worth. You know better than this. Irresponsible.
1243726128331681792 2020-03-28 02:26:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheOutvoted @C4liCrypto @kenklippenstein *billion
1243726073721847808 2020-03-28 02:26:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TheOutvoted @C4liCrypto @kenklippenstein He doesn't have 55 billion dollars. His net worth is 55 million dollars. You understand the difference right?
1243725676655464448 2020-03-28 02:24:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @peterpham  https://t.co/cXpabttosf
1243721662672990209 2020-03-28 02:08:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IsaiahAscher Definitely. Which...again...just really surprising. I find it to be so easy, but the fact that so many others don't means there is opportunity there for some company.
1243721103110897664 2020-03-28 02:06:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IsaiahAscher My friends are like, "this is really confusing, can we just use facetime?". Really surprising.
1243720807034974208 2020-03-28 02:05:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IsaiahAscher Just like...my buddies and parents. If they don't use Zoom for their business they actually have a really hard time with it. To me, that's an interesting takeaway given how easy I think it is.
1243720513022603267 2020-03-28 02:04:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @IsaiahAscher I'm not talking about companies. I'm talking about friends and family outside of the tech community. It's like I'm asking them to write code.
1243720087636332545 2020-03-28 02:02:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One really interesting learning during this time is how few of my non-tech friends use or understand Zoom.   For as simple as it is, somehow, they don't get it.   Seems like a major opportunity to me.
1243349428271890433 2020-03-27 01:29:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Is that a Mac from 1996?
1243172401581445120 2020-03-26 13:46:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> We had a LOT of fun last Thursday.  So, we're doing it again. Wanna join?  @thescottleese  and I will be hosting a live happy hour:   "Thursday Night Sales"  Bring a drink, and bring your favorite sales questions.  Tonight: 5p PT.  See ya there.   https://t.co/xP0X4XzaCn  ✌🏻  https://t.co/KujvWj9GSF
1242564736660541441 2020-03-24 21:31:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Come join us on Thursday for sales and beers.
1242453558328324097 2020-03-24 14:09:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Pro-life until the economy hurts.   Then it's suddenly pro-sickness and pro-death.   Weird. 🤷‍♂️
1241741608392863745 2020-03-22 15:00:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese and I got a little shoutout in Bloomberg (@business) news for our virtual happy hour 🍻  Nice to see these happening...   https://t.co/YiYukZJDqH via @luxury
1241516245100277760 2020-03-22 00:05:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk This. 100%.

1241068664779976705 2020-03-20 18:26:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson I hope you are right, but most folks I talk to that have been supporting Trump are just digging in even more. There’s a new talk track from FOX and they are simply repeating. I’m flabbergasted.
1241009890333569025 2020-03-20 14:33:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @theyearofelan Sleepy brown beans.
1240732617357418498 2020-03-19 20:11:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Everyone is bagging on the spring break kids video. I get it.  But, remember, these kids are at a point in their lives where they are supposed to make really stupid choices.  I'm much more upset about the responsible adults who are fucking this thing up.
1240725880051130368 2020-03-19 19:44:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Come spend some time with @thescottleese and me to talk sales and career development.

1240700375226658816 2020-03-19 18:03:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @paulg @QBI_UCSF Done. Thanks for sharing!
1240665959695650816 2020-03-19 15:46:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek @JamesClear After reading 1,378,934 blogs on how to build a business, I can attest to this being true. Focus. Then begin.
1240659659117039617 2020-03-19 15:21:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @alexrkonrad I feel like every Grubhub story makes me less likely to use them.
1240659454707650560 2020-03-19 15:20:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m Exactly. We can all be problem solvers and help businesses and people in times that are scary and new. Let’s just be tactful.
1240657178307883008 2020-03-19 15:11:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People are shaming sellers right now, but a company I’m advising is helping doctors communicate more effectively with their patients during this challenging time.   Not all sales are bad.
1240656820319862785 2020-03-19 15:10:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @MorningBrew released a very solid guide on living your best quarantined life.    https://t.co/xStFCNTlt7
1240461261659242498 2020-03-19 02:13:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek A good lesson. Delivered many times over by people that are 100x less divisive than this guy. You’re better than to share his brain.
1240443821340553216 2020-03-19 01:03:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarryStebbings I think 2 in the sense that people will wash their hands more and avoid useless contact greetings i.e handshakes when there are better options. I think 1 is also likely because people will cherish physical proximity.
1240277443794989056 2020-03-18 14:02:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Come spend some time with @thescottleese and me.  Tomorrow at 5p PT, we're doing a Free Zoom Happy Hour🍺  Let's talk shop. Enjoy each other's virtual company.   Cheers.   https://t.co/5QQ7dAi0Ve

1240093318899363846 2020-03-18 01:51:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collincadmus I think you can buy for a year from now. That’s pretty awesome.

1240086662169767936 2020-03-18 01:24:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JakeTDunlap I just want you to enjoy your staycation, homie. Unplug. 🍻
1240066361226752001 2020-03-18 00:03:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collincadmus I'm considering buying every international trip I've ever wanted to take. Brazil in 6 years? Sure, why not.
1239734657442185217 2020-03-17 02:05:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Forbes This is such a predictable play. What a loser.
1239718632919191553 2020-03-17 01:02:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @taylorleese @TaylorInternet I have not done yet. Will report back when successful.
1239716969642778624 2020-03-17 00:55:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @taylorleese @TaylorInternet Just had this discussion with my parents. Time to move from FaceTime to Zoom. I’ve got screens to share for Christ’s sake.
1239344322345984000 2020-03-16 00:14:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> About to do my first Zoom Happy Hour with @the1truederek. Life is starting to change!
1239225842720337920 2020-03-15 16:23:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @LanceUlanoff Thank goodness. I did this for the first time, 30 seconds before seeing this tweet.
1239223589049479169 2020-03-15 16:15:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Just terrific.
1239222079334957056 2020-03-15 16:09:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JohnMBarrows @saywhatsales As someone who has built a bunch of orgs selling to "uneducated" buyers (meaning, they don't have a process), getting them to adopt a process can be really challenging. You can't just sell. You must guide.
1239214086191112192 2020-03-15 15:37:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Woke up. Looked at Instagram.   The amount of “breaking quarantine to party because it’s my besties bday!!”...staggering.   #StayTheFHome
1238996271597121536 2020-03-15 01:11:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson @Josh_G_Roth Yep. I’ve just seen too many things that flabbergast me with folks calling this “fake”. I’d love to be wrong.
1238993538362134528 2020-03-15 01:00:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson I believe the first part of this tweet, but unfortunately not the second. I really hope I’m wrong.
1238992240917106688 2020-03-15 00:55:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarryStebbings My wife told her parents that the death associated with it has been described as “drowning in your own lungs...”. That seemed to work, as morbid as it is.
1238991950100885504 2020-03-15 00:54:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk This goes especially poorly at companies without a lot of “A players”.   One guy/gal becomes the consistent go-to and then burns out.
1238917441771556865 2020-03-14 19:58:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek DJ + AOC? Now I KNOW the world is ending.
1238863154454491137 2020-03-14 16:22:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stretch_vp Thanks for sharing!
1238856088193085440 2020-03-14 15:54:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I created a free PDF on simple SaaS metrics for beginners.  It's designed to cover the basics.   (NOT complex SaaS formulas)  If you're new to SaaS and need help, head here:  https://t.co/20bGrCEGxv  Just punch $0 in the box and hit "I want this".  Enjoy! 🙏
1238846038707802113 2020-03-14 15:14:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese Insanity.
1238658549682593792 2020-03-14 02:49:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SchneiderKJ @onepeloton Yeah, the cost of the bike is tough. The membership is amazing. It’s the best workout I get.
1238645209581244416 2020-03-14 01:56:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SchneiderKJ It's a great time to be a @onepeloton owner. But it requires a pretty massive investment.
1238615273583677441 2020-03-13 23:57:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reckless Someone has to be a kid around here 🤷‍♂️
1238600522212368384 2020-03-13 22:59:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @reckless Open-faced pizza sandwiches.
1238593594635603968 2020-03-13 22:31:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @crystalegger @eusdtweets Wow. Good on schools for closing...it's the right move. I'm glad she's ok.
1238592498382995456 2020-03-13 22:27:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf The Zoom mullet.
1238592091002777605 2020-03-13 22:25:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> After hearing @CJ_Johnson17th talk about @gumroad for a long time, I finally took the plunge today. REALLY enjoying it so far.   Dropped a little course on SaaS metrics for salespeople.  Thanks, @shl!
1238298893365817348 2020-03-13 03:00:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @saastr @jasonlk @MarriottIntl @Marriott Any company prioritizing corporate greed over global protection ends up on my forever sh*t list.
1238298331824009216 2020-03-13 02:58:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk @saastr I used to stay at @MarriottIntl often but with this look? Nah. Best of luck, Jason. Super bummed to see what you’re going through.
1238290665944973314 2020-03-13 02:27:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ahassonn You can email me at hello@theofficialjustin.com   Cheers.
1238286155474321408 2020-03-13 02:10:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @DannyZuker I'm late to this but, man...this is just so damn good.
1238284933749080065 2020-03-13 02:05:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ahassonn I like early-stage technology companies. You're going to expedite failure and learning faster than your friends.
1238279284298407937 2020-03-13 01:42:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Me: I’m taking social distancing very seriously.   My dogs:  https://t.co/VldpqirIo2
1237976739613003776 2020-03-12 05:40:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Flexibility (might be covered in low cost of living). The ability to move from higher cost to lower cost quickly. Rent, Bills, etc.
1237201477594046464 2020-03-10 02:19:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @_harryhurst @rrhoover @pipe @joshmangel @weekendfund Congrats, Harry. Excited to see this. 🙏
1237199886124077056 2020-03-10 02:13:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley @Its_Jenn_Here You certainly can! It’ll take us some time which will hopefully give us some better insight into Coronavirus.
1237175124333195271 2020-03-10 00:35:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley @Its_Jenn_Here For reals.
1236484888024346624 2020-03-08 02:52:24 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Grubhub is the DMV of tech customer service.
1236070005495586817 2020-03-06 23:23:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 7 months ago, I stepped away from my executive role at a SaaS business. Here’s what I’ve learned since...  https://t.co/p6nZ9Njw8k
1232487215294382080 2020-02-26 02:07:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley Haha. I'm just playing. :)

1229971841130745856 2020-02-19 03:31:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @schlaf Good salespeople ask questions with a sales-centric goal in mind (ex: moving prospect to next stage).   Amazing salespeople ask questions with the customer’s problem in mind. They are empathetic and like solving problems. They truly care about their customer.
1229957396300124160 2020-02-19 02:34:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JoelGoyette @EemPdx was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The Chef's tasting menu at Oui Wine Bar (@SEWineColl) was also incredible.
1229949527089483778 2020-02-19 02:03:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo Awesome. Thanks for taking the time to reply.
1229948500047089665 2020-02-19 01:59:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dvassallo When you were just getting started, what was most impactful? Your tweets, your interaction with other people's tweets or something else?
1229948127123165184 2020-02-19 01:57:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP @FUNDConference @rjpahura This is great, Amy! Congratulations and SO well deserved, friend.
1229780578200776704 2020-02-18 14:51:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I think one of the underrated features of @Superhuman is the gorgeous background photos.  My wife walks in each morning and says, "Oooh! What's that?"
1229461584759492608 2020-02-17 17:44:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP @Josh_G_Roth Oh haha. I misread. Only in PDX is right.
1229454631337463808 2020-02-17 17:16:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @destinylalane Eem Thai BBQ was insane. Hat Yai was delicious. Oui Wine Bar was killer. Urdaneta Spanish tapas was lovely. All donuts came back with grade A rating.
1229452031552700416 2020-02-17 17:06:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth What is Frisbee? Food delivery?
1229451968898199552 2020-02-17 17:06:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @destinylalane LA has amazing, amazing food. Portland is really impressive though and the value is off of the charts. Both are excellent food cities.
1229435548994899968 2020-02-17 16:00:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Portland might have the strongest food game on Earth right now.   In 96 hours I consumed 3 of the best meals I've had in a long time.
1229226607069421568 2020-02-17 02:10:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulMinor4real Active recovery. Good man. Low key walking....get some rest. Nice work, dude.
1229110386948837376 2020-02-16 18:28:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've watched this twice this AM. So nice to see...  Happy Sunday.
1228918417941417985 2020-02-16 05:45:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulMinor4real Paul, you are an inspiration. Get it dude. Every day. I’m loving watching you shine.
1228808325690621952 2020-02-15 22:28:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulMinor4real Looking like a champion. Keep up the great work!
1228805828418953218 2020-02-15 22:18:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Pierre has gained a few ounces in #Portland, especially at @bluestardonuts   Portland might be the best food city in the US.   #pierregoesaround #pierregoesaroundportland #donuts #portlandoregon #oregon #doughnuts…  https://t.co/2TArNa0tHw
1228378055527133184 2020-02-14 17:58:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Such a simple decision.
1228002468027490306 2020-02-13 17:06:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @biz Any person that can't judge and control their volume in public places is a nuisance.

1227688539174817792 2020-02-12 20:18:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @AvenueTP @thescottleese @smckenna719 @TomBoccard @paulsalamanca Thanks, Josh!
1227611527156363264 2020-02-12 15:12:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PaulMinor4real Let's go, Paul. You got folks cheering you on...Don't let anyone else get your ear.
1227610964356263936 2020-02-12 15:10:36 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michelletandler Coffee --&gt; Lemon Ginger --&gt; Mint --&gt; Lunch --&gt; Green tea. Rinse, repeat :)
1227610293997490176 2020-02-12 15:07:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @michelletandler Might I recommend mate or tea? A good lemon ginger goes a long way.
1227289735799791617 2020-02-11 17:54:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth D7A
1226726209720967170 2020-02-10 04:34:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @arteeninLA I was 21 and still didn't understand this.
1226696496139030528 2020-02-10 02:36:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Can someone explain the relevance of that Eminem performance?
1225620964659974144 2020-02-07 03:23:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Haha. This didn't sound like you. We can resume our friendship.
1225620192014651392 2020-02-07 03:19:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth You're that guy?? Oh no. Two types of people: 10 minutes before flight people and 2 hours before flight people.
1225604093244084224 2020-02-07 02:16:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarryStebbings I'd pay money to listen to a great CEO talk about how he or she has mastered this...
1225487246075342848 2020-02-06 18:31:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson Glad it was helpful. Looking fwd to reading this.
1224699584384888832 2020-02-04 14:21:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @AlyintheATL @saywhatsales @rharris415 @thedandisney @AvenueTP I think they are important and it would be helpful for every employee to have a crash course upon entering the sales world. I was literally talking about putting together a webinar on this yesterday.
1224516419104264194 2020-02-04 02:13:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NortonSupport Hi Prasanna - it won't even let me send the URL in a DM (likely because of the blacklist). The full URL is www dot thelinkedinplaybook dot com
1224514240867758080 2020-02-04 02:05:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NortonSupport Hi Prasanna - Twitter won't let me send the URL through a comment or DM for some reason. Can you DM me the best email address to send it to??
1224512169728888833 2020-02-04 01:57:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @NortonSupport I've been dealing with a website security issue for over two months. How can I reach someone to talk about it? I'm struggling over here.
1224405712916205568 2020-02-03 18:54:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP Ahh..misunderstood. Hit me up when finished!
1224366088881750016 2020-02-03 16:16:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP Such a wonderful and sad book. So beautifully written. Glad you enjoyed it

1224207526868049920 2020-02-03 05:46:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @elriclegloire It was good minus being sick 2 out of 4 days. I missed both family dinner at Quintonil and Frida museum. I made Contramar and cooking class in Condesa. All in all disappointed that happened. 5th time there, first time ill.
1224163183838945280 2020-02-03 02:50:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Finally. Haha. They have a blimp can, sky cam, dancer cam, ref cam...need a goal line view? Nope.
1224162638529085441 2020-02-03 02:48:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> They have every angle but not straight down the goal line??
1224142254823968771 2020-02-03 01:27:11 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jason Disagree.
1224137138922381314 2020-02-03 01:06:51 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @davegerhardt I laugh all of the time. I very rarely get emotional. Google for the win since it tied emotion to a specific function of the product.
1224134877655773184 2020-02-03 00:57:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Google just crushed that commercial. Good storytelling, emotion, heart strings, but still focused on a product feature.
1224134512168189952 2020-02-03 00:56:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kumailn Ditto
1224134219615498240 2020-02-03 00:55:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @Google Literally made me tear up. Good work by @Google

1221528806667587588 2020-01-26 20:22:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth Crazy. I literally feel sick.

Been having trouble with my custom URL for over two months...Kajabi says it's a GoDaddy issue, and GoDaddy says it's a Kajabi issue. At this point, just need some answers...Can someone help? Nobody on your chat help can figure it out.
1219352079111581696 2020-01-20 20:12:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ProductHunt Burnout has become synonymous with overwork but I've found it's more closely tied to loss of control. So...prioritize and delegate/cut. Build in break times to make sure you don't go back to working on lower priority things...

1218257022497390593 2020-01-17 19:41:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I love to be motivated. In business, we have so many people that we can look to for that extra push...  My personal favorite? Nobody gets the job done like @RobinNYC. Period.
1218022157520781312 2020-01-17 04:08:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dgoldy216 Sure thing. 🎉
1218018138698072065 2020-01-17 03:52:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dgoldy216 When you’ve got opp creation and velocity (time to close) you got a pretty decent grasp on what’s going on. Once you close more deals I’d focus on what the bigger deals look and act like. Then narrow in on ICP opp creation by rep.
1218017745628889091 2020-01-17 03:50:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dgoldy216 And Since revenue is important but you’re sorta guessing, I’d add opp creation by rep or team.
1218017661944131584 2020-01-17 03:50:14 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dgoldy216 Cool. I don’t know if I care that much about close rate because the denominator (opportunities) is more important. Closing 1 for 2 at 50% isn’t as compelling as 4 for 10 at 40% ya know?
1218014035028742146 2020-01-17 03:35:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dgoldy216 How are the prospects coming into the funnel? What’s the ACV and sales cycle?

One cancelled on me last minute  One didn’t know why she was there  One told us they didn’t know if they took our insurance  Yes, healthcare is broken, but so are many physician practices.

1213539685957455872 2020-01-04 19:16:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PhilGuesty @saastr I 100% will. Thanks, Phil!
1213538765253169155 2020-01-04 19:12:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cvonhuene @saastr That would be dope. Want to shoot it over to hello@theofficialjustin.com ?? Thx so much for that, Chris.
1213536140680032256 2020-01-04 19:02:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Jason An almond croissant and a cup of hot coffee.
1213535353212030976 2020-01-04 18:59:09 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @luigimallardo That's a good thought. Barcelona is out (simply because I've been there recently - I love it) so Lisbon was high on my list. Italy could be a great time, but I've always felt like it deserves like 2 weeks, no?
1213535141546430464 2020-01-04 18:58:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @PhilGuesty @saastr Haha. Love me some warm, brown beer (I actually am a fan of real ale). Have you been to Lisbon yet?
1213534993466572800 2020-01-04 18:57:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bcnorange @saastr I love Barcelona, but been there recently. Went to London about 10 years ago, but haven't been back. Never been to Lisbon. Is it that you love London, or just don't favor Lisbon? Or both? Curious.
1213534764809900032 2020-01-04 18:56:48 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cvonhuene @saastr Any thoughts on the best neighborhood to stay in?
1213319461140234240 2020-01-04 04:41:16 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @shuggilippo @saastr Ooh. “Thorough country report”. Tell me more! What did you love? I’m really excited and Lisbon is def where I’m going.
1213273261028470785 2020-01-04 01:37:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @evvie85 @saastr Gracias.

1213244183193870336 2020-01-03 23:42:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmj @typesfast The setting that blasts reps theme music when they close a deal is epic. Our office was a mixture of Nipsey Hussle, Bon Jovi and Madonna. Chaos, but fun. @AmbitionSales is great.

1213214578324070400 2020-01-03 21:44:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @farnoushouts I haven't been to London in a decade and I loved it the first time. What's a really hip part of the city to stay in for good craft beer/wine/foodie experiences?
1213214388368265217 2020-01-03 21:43:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth @collincadmus @saastr My parents are headed to Split soon. Waiting to hear back on what they think, but it's on my 2021 list!
1213214298845007872 2020-01-03 21:43:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collincadmus @saastr Was considering Italy but have this notion it requires like 2-3 weeks. Lisbon seems like a city I can do in 6 days (maybe I'm wrong though)
1213143243115753477 2020-01-03 17:01:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @thescottleese @saastr Awesome. Lots of votes for Lisbon!
1213143173083459584 2020-01-03 17:00:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @saastr @thescottleese Definitely, but have been recently. Never been to Lisbon and haven’t been to London in over a decade. Looking forward to seeing y’all in Paris.
1213142982540447745 2020-01-03 17:00:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jcmrgo @saastr I’ve got 5 or 6 days. Lisbon seems (obviously) way cheaper. I just don’t know a whole lot about it. People seem to love it though.
1213129397563203586 2020-01-03 16:06:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So many salespeople leave their roles today for an extra $10,000 in salary. They do it without thinking about the stuff that actually matters: company, team, culture, product, equity, comp plan, responsibility, career pathing...  Don't be that salesperson.
1213122731350167554 2020-01-03 15:39:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Headed to @saastr Europa this June in Paris.   Planning an after trip...two choices:  1. #London 2. #Lisbon  My wife and I are foodies and drinkies. Would love to hear thoughts from people who have been there.

1211151089501794304 2019-12-29 05:04:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Tough loss for the Buckeyes tonight. Great season, really great team. Worked hard and came up just a bit short. To next year.
1211139321962455040 2019-12-29 04:18:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m Yeah I know. Not questioning the call as the rules are the rules. Just strange that you can snag a ball with one hand and drag a toe for .2 seconds and it’s a catch. But the same logic doesn’t apply when you’re wrapped up by a DB. Just weird.
1211137709357568001 2019-12-29 04:11:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m I love how catching a ball and taking 3 steps with the ball securely tightened isn't a "catch" but tapping one toe in bounds is a catch. 🤔 Color me confused.
1211119915903508480 2019-12-29 03:01:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m Terrible rule. Changes games completely, kicks kids out for split-second reflex plays...just silly.
1211118748465188864 2019-12-29 02:56:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Targeting calls literally change games.

1210630665680506880 2019-12-27 18:36:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc Well, shit...thanks, man. I appreciate that. You're one of my fave follows as well! Here's to a big 2020 (and let's get some content ideas lined up together).
1210592682407604225 2019-12-27 16:06:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you can only work on three things in your career make them these:  ⓵ Your brand. ⓶ Your attitude.  ⓷ Your network.  If you get these right over everything else...  You'll win.
1210368331628212224 2019-12-27 01:14:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I just discovered @IFTTT and I am now MacGyver. That is all.
1210319882354597888 2019-12-26 22:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> My dad grew up in a 1-room house w/ 4 siblings. Stepdad was illiterate. Mom ran a bar. Dirt poor.  Put himself through college, married his sweetheart, pestered college counselor to help land a job, &amp; 30 years later was their first HOF inductee.  You can do anything. Merry Xmas.

1208849997053038593 2019-12-22 20:41:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BradTonoff Find a niche. Establish your voice.  Create content regularly.  Stay consistent.  Engage with others in your niche.
1208793140921917440 2019-12-22 16:55:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jmj This is a GREAT idea. I've found that with being distributed, whiteboarding sessions is what I've missed the most. The lack of collaboration hurts. Interested to see who is solving this.
1208772699180265473 2019-12-22 15:34:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nayar_amit Definitely. The tech scene here has become really interesting and I only think there's more $$ on the way.
1208588469598998528 2019-12-22 03:22:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @nayar_amit I've been here for almost 4 years and I (quasi) agree. Weather is great. Housing is still ridiculous (although much better than SF).   One particular thing I love about LA is the access to top young people: UCLA, USC, LMU, Pepperdine...Huge talent funnel.
1208573426601869320 2019-12-22 02:22:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @ArlanWasHere Politics seems like a place where disparaging your opponents is widely considered normal. I wonder if someone ran a different playbook (humble, gracious, empathetic) if they wouldn't stand out? Maybe this is why I'm not in politics?
1208571565094236160 2019-12-22 02:14:49 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Nearly all career problems can be solved w/ personal brand building.  Want to sell more? Build your brand. Want to hire better people? Build your brand. Want to make more $$? Build your brand. Want to get a better job? Build your brand.  Why isn't everyone doing this?🤔It's FREE.
1208140504983932928 2019-12-20 21:41:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abrowning100 Haha. Read while on the couch and then it's 2 birds.
1208055962055127040 2019-12-20 16:06:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's tough to create wealth for yourself when all of your time is spent creating wealth for someone else.  Take at least a few hours each week to think about long-term wealth creation. Break free in your after hours.

1207070715284840449 2019-12-17 22:50:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cvonhuene @coefficientlabs Love that, Chris. I think there are certain benefits to m having a 1:1 mentor as well. I love the back and forth and the bouncing of ideas. Just my two cents.
1207070497147478016 2019-12-17 22:50:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @cvonhuene @Superhuman They have really thought through how people use Gmail and have built a software that keeps me looking at my email only twice per day without fear of missing things. It literally streamlines how I work now.
1207054868193697794 2019-12-17 21:48:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> What are the information gaps that are out there for people who want to learn about accelerating their careers? I'd like to spend 2020 creating content that fills those.  What knowledge are you missing?
1206683563955032074 2019-12-16 21:12:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I call BS on "not being able to find a mentor". Get creative.  Make it happen.   I sat down with Sean Goldfaden over at @coefficientlabs to talk about what it takes to find a good mentor.  Invest in yourself.   Remember...long game.  https://t.co/BldxWHn5yP

1205246449002393606 2019-12-12 22:02:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Curiosity is the differentiator.  It's often the difference between the star and the dud.  I want to find someone who digs deep. Who goes layer after layer. If you find that person, you might find their persistence annoying.  Don't. You'll love it when it's for your business.

1204838765015060481 2019-12-11 19:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You can "hack" a lot of stuff at work.  But, consistency ain't one of them.
1204518158897418240 2019-12-10 21:48:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So excited to announce the release of my course, The LinkedIn Playbook!  Everything I've learned the past 12 months growing my brand on LinkedIn and 10x'ing my followers.  All wrapped into a nice, neat, AFFORDABLE, 2-hour package.

1202437078954336256 2019-12-05 03:58:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Austen I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed Nipsey Hussle being interviewed by Gary Vaynerchuk.
1202435667872993280 2019-12-05 03:52:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek Likely host a podcast but that doesn’t really scare me. I’d like to speak in front of 5k+ people. Still doesn’t really scare me shitless. Maybe bungee jump? I want to face an incredible fear and conquer it. Heights is one.
1202302055009996806 2019-12-04 19:02:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In 2020, I want to commit to doing something that scares the shit out of me. Join me.  You could:  Run a full marathon. Speak up at work. Host a podcast. Speak in public. Be vulnerable. Make a video. Act onstage. Network.  What are you afraid of, that you will overcome in 2020?
1202056919759802368 2019-12-04 02:47:57 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SchneiderKJ I don't know if it's truly sales-related, to be honest, Keith. I think it's a personality trait. I believe I'd flip-flop between these emotions if I were doing any role in any department. That's just my take on it...
1202056639940972546 2019-12-04 02:46:50 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @lilmac024 It's DEFINITELY not just you, Matt. It's all of us that strive to be successful in our careers. It's just good to know we're not all alone in these feelings/fears.
1201981435785166855 2019-12-03 21:48:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> It's been surprising (and relieving) to meet with so many high-performance individuals and find out they too have self-doubt.   Flip-flopping between "I'm going to fail..." and "I'm the greatest ever!" seems to be very common.   Self-doubt drives.
1201694036605599744 2019-12-03 02:45:59 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JakeTDunlap Love this, Jake.
1201609990085197825 2019-12-02 21:12:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you have a bad manager, it's amazing how much you can still thrive &amp; grow by combining time spent with internal superstars + external mentors.
1200579388288335873 2019-11-30 00:56:46 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @gaetano_nyc @MFormisano2 Gaetano - is the the first time you’ve seen one of these? I’m genuinely curious. They were everywhere in Ohio as I was growing up. The fact that you rarely see them anymore is a good thing. Next, we need to cancel Juul. Cancer-slingers.
1200173018741383175 2019-11-28 22:02:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> An amazing group of supporters to thank this year:   @saastr @SalesHacker @BoweryCapital @MeridianStCap @coefficientlabs @xvoyant @catalystsale @mailshakeapp @Close @SalesDevelopers @outreach_io  @startupsalesio  Excited for the next 12 months.
1200074793569128450 2019-11-28 15:31:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki Hey, thanks, Andrew. That means a lot!
1199823991738945538 2019-11-27 22:55:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TommyTahoe filling last-minute no-shows in their practice. Then I added it to their Google My Business page and the Voicemail tree and it started working instantly. My boss called and was basically like, "F*** yeah!". Then we spread it company-wide.
1199823750331539458 2019-11-27 22:54:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @TommyTahoe Definitely, Tom. I remember when I got moved from SF to Boston to launch a new market for Zocdoc. The pitch was always, "more new patients" but MA had statewide healthcare. Doctors didn't need new patients. So rather than keep trying that, I just flipped it to....
1199823411322732544 2019-11-27 22:52:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collincadmus Same here, Collin. I wasn't allowed in pharma or med device. As soon as I got to Zocdoc, I saw something broken, tried something new, and it worked. My boss? He said, "f*** yeah". And then we shared it with the whole company. I was hooked.
1199765336989540352 2019-11-27 19:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In my career, if I saw even a 60% chance of fixing a broken process, I always went for it with or without permission.   it's hard to screw up too much stuff in a siloed experiment, but the upside is huge if it's replicable across everyone.  Just go do that stuff. Am I off here?
1199672626903318530 2019-11-27 12:53:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I pinch and zoom a lot on Google Maps to see street names and then complain when I can't.   Now it's just mocking me.  https://t.co/pv8OllTVyS
1199444723200667649 2019-11-26 21:48:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In order to grow in my career, I had to figure out how to be successful when things were really challenging. Really bad. You should do it too.  Once you figure it out. Repeat. Build that brand. Be that person.  That will never go out of style.
1199348091247185920 2019-11-26 15:24:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Suhail 1. Declining reimbursements 2. Patients themselves often don’t respect the physician’s time i.e. high no-show rates means “schedule stuffing” to guard against.
1199208391161217026 2019-11-26 06:08:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndyCabistan This is super, Andy. Thanks for sharing!
1199073275839754241 2019-11-25 21:12:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Complaining about your job is usually meaningless.  YOU control the majority of your success.   Yes, there are outside factors.  Yes, your manager matters. Yes, poor company process can hurt. Yes, you should have had more training.   But in the end…it’s typically just on you.
1199012234241818625 2019-11-25 17:09:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Spot on.
1199012199462658052 2019-11-25 17:09:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek Love this.
1198985578399719424 2019-11-25 15:23:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @dennisyu @LinkedIn It’s not at the moment. Will likely get turned into one at some point.

1197609028173680641 2019-11-21 20:13:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A few rules that made me better at work:  1. Don't state your opinions as facts when they aren't. 2. Don't use absolutes...very rarely is something "always" or "never"... 3. Listen and ask clarifying questions. Good decisions get made when you fully understand.
1196908006841208832 2019-11-19 21:48:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Excuses are like candy, alcohol or cigarettes. You get addicted. Make them for life.  Same w/ success. Success requires that you deliver MORE success. So rather than being a complacent, lazy addiction like excuses, it's the opposite.  Hard work + accountability =  Better outcomes

1194691902857191425 2019-11-13 19:02:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Was really nice to see Obama talking about the call-out, victim culture this past week. Too many victims, not enough effort. Step away from the angry groupthink &amp; begin to weaponize for your growth. Your weapons?  Consistency. Authenticity. Work ethic. Patience. Content. Effort.
1194375092773388288 2019-11-12 22:03:07 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Josh_G_Roth 💯 Audit frequently.

1193617918606467073 2019-11-10 19:54:22 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SportsBoyTony They should have pitched it back into the end zone a few yards
1193597558494416897 2019-11-10 18:33:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @SportsBoyTony I can’t figure out why pitching the ball backwards 5 yards to the 6 doesn’t work.

1192602525544910850 2019-11-08 00:39:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rrhoover Just posting a newsletter each week. LinkedIn is pushing these newsletters hard to their audience. They are doing it all. I accumulated 26k subscribers in about 4 months. I wake up each day and there are 75-100 new subs.
1192596426855010305 2019-11-08 00:15:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rrhoover This has been an incredibly valuable feature for me.

I’d love to see you use it to expose lessons you’ve learned to the LI audience.
1192493800956018689 2019-11-07 17:27:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP Thanks for the shout, Amy. I see companies missing this by confusing culture and amenities.

1191893679482519555 2019-11-06 01:42:52 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jim_brown @woutdispa Flying into Auckland, then Queenstown, Marlborough, Hawkes Bay, then back to Auckland and home to LA. What were your favorite places?
1191891250586238976 2019-11-06 01:33:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP @simmons_m I get WAY more outcomes from Linkedin, but that's just because I haven't dedicated the same time to Twitter.
1191891083036446721 2019-11-06 01:32:33 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @woutdispa Haha, maybe. LinkedIn powers my business, which powers my revenue, which powers my freedom. Freedom = getting out a lot. I'd share more, but I'm off to NYC, then New Zealand for a few weeks 😛
1191860762626732033 2019-11-05 23:32:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m That it is, Mike. I love LinkedIn, but Twitter feels way more raw.
1191850050219065344 2019-11-05 22:49:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndyCabistan Thanks so much, Andy. Very humbled that.
1191834576374706176 2019-11-05 21:48:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I love #LinkedIn but I feel like on Twitter it's more unique and personal. Everyone on LinkedIn just regurgitating what they read in business books. No real-world stuff.
1190296353416478720 2019-11-01 15:55:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP @simonsinek Wow I love that. Thanks for sharing!
1190011070909427712 2019-10-31 21:02:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> HOW you get there is just as important as getting there.  Step on a lot of toes on the way up OR have the support of your peers?  Many choose the former. I recommend the latter.  Don't fall victim to games and impatience.  The fall is hard.
1189956964727447552 2019-10-31 17:27:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I had a great time sitting down with @BoweryCapital to discuss mental health at startups.  #Mentalhealth #burnout
1189650072226582528 2019-10-30 21:07:34 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndyCabistan Exactly, man. Get inspired rather than jealous. Super simple way to level up.
1189603390390751233 2019-10-30 18:02:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Every time that you make a decision to hate on someone else's success, you miss a major opportunity. Take other people's success and flip it into an opportunity to strengthen your network.  There is no strength in hate.
1189321880529985536 2019-10-29 23:23:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @simmons_m @annaelwood Exactly, Mike. What I’m suggesting is that cost of entry and risk are so minimal and upside is so maximal.
1189282762676756482 2019-10-29 20:48:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> You can set up a website and sell courses in less than a week for less than $100.  You can earn thousands of dollars over the course of time by selling your knowledge.  What's the catch?  Hard work. Patience. Effort.  Time.
1188631194545446912 2019-10-28 01:38:55 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Just read “Catch and Kill” by @RonanFarrow on a cross-country flight. Could not put it down. Wow.   The systemic abuse in both politics and Hollywood is sickening.   These “old boy’s clubs” must be dismantled.

1187555293510754305 2019-10-25 02:23:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndyCabistan @marceloclaure This is awesome, Andy. Thanks for sharing! 🙌🏻
1187479000245002240 2019-10-24 21:20:30 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @JakeTDunlap Thanks, Jake. Appreciate that, man.
1187474347339870208 2019-10-24 21:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 10 years ago, I stopped thinking about my career in terms of "role".  SDR, AE, Manager, Director, etc.  I started thinking in terms of "brand". The guy that gets sh*t done, fixes problems, executes, rallies the troops, breaks into new markets.  Who do you want to be?
1187066661888843776 2019-10-23 18:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you hate your job and you're not using:  YouTube to educate Shopify/Squarespace to create Social media to distribute  What the hell are you doing?   Right now... Risk is SO minimal. Reward is SO maximal.  #sidehustle
1186782964832788480 2019-10-22 23:14:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @the1truederek Same here. But I know what they mean.  Been hearing it for 10 years 😂
1186746045851754498 2019-10-22 20:48:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've noticed that when I share big ideas or grand plans with people that have never stepped outside of their comfort zone, the initial reaction is one of ridicule.  Ideas are "crazy" or "bad" or "silly"...  Then I go make them work.  Just a note for everyone trying something new.

1184937631769153552 2019-10-17 21:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> See a lot of companies going pure outbound on 4-6k ACV. When I ask why...  Didn't get many inbound demos Inbound was hard Economics didn't work  Need more demos? Think inbound is hard? Those economics weren't good?  Oof. I think you're in for a big surprise.  ✌🏻  #inbound
1184529943386042375 2019-10-16 18:02:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 99% of people invest more of their 💰 in vices than their own career.  Here's an idea:  Take $200. Cancel a few brunches. Don't buy the booze. Invest in a headshot. Put it on every social profile.  Rinse and repeat.  Next up? Website. Podcast.  Vices have a 0% return   #branding
1184336158030888960 2019-10-16 05:11:58 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abrowning100 Thanks, Aaron. I was in awe of the accomplishment and found it to be very relevant to almost anything we strive for. Bravo to this guy.

1179864201222918154 2019-10-03 21:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Your 1st sales hire is a tough one. You need someone who can build strong process.  A thinker.  But also action-oriented. A do'er.  Comfortable operating on a few assumptions, crappy collateral, &amp; wonky expectations.  They don't complain about resources.   A true purple squirrel.  https://t.co/RvbBRPXiYG

1179789142927929344 2019-10-03 16:03:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Kajabi Hi team - having a really difficult time getting a response from one of your service team members. Can you help me?
1179788891261243392 2019-10-03 16:02:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @bMi2 It's in there! :)
1179529717138874368 2019-10-02 22:52:53 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson Your last sentence is the hypothesis I had to begin with. I really appreciate this dialogue, Patrick.
1179514630202281984 2019-10-02 21:52:56 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson Gotcha, that I did not understand. Thanks for providing that detail...interesting. Learning more each day.
1179488672233607168 2019-10-02 20:09:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson ...it just feels like this is another example of the risk/reward game being tilted very far towards ONLY the CEO and those who invested. I may be very much misunderstanding it though. But I guess...if I am, are others? All things I'm thinking about. Hope all is well!
1179488395321430016 2019-10-02 20:08:41 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson what (appears to be) equity that is no longer valuable. (note: I don't know enough about this to make that statement confidently) I wonder how many times this happens before it becomes very, very difficult to attract top talent? Equity is already such a finicky beast...
1179487886254600193 2019-10-02 20:06:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson Thanks for such a thoughtful response, Patrick. This is exactly why I asked the question. It's interesting as we're probably looking at it from two very different viewpoints, you as the VC and me as the recent operator who feels (SO strongly) for those who have...
1179456520465059841 2019-10-02 18:02:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> One of the best lessons learned in my career is that you HAVE to term someone the moment you realize they are a culture killer.  You can't wait a month. You can't wait two weeks. You gotta get them out ASAP.  Doesn't matter if it's your top performer.  If they're poisonous? Gone.
1179228896841080834 2019-10-02 02:57:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Yep.
1179227853411557382 2019-10-02 02:53:23 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson I really appreciate this take,  but ultimately wonder what your personal view is of the impact on others? Sure, he “played the game right” along with his VC pals, but man...this whole situation just strikes me as quite sociopathic by all involved. Maybe I’m naive?
1179154958676971520 2019-10-01 22:03:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AndyCabistan @jasonlk SMB leaders, IMO, tend to run fast-paced experiments often. They are constantly changing &amp; tweaking parts of the process because they have so many at bats. My assumption is that's less possible in Enterprise but I can't speak to it well enough.
1179082199401783297 2019-10-01 17:14:37 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @abrowning100 Definitely. Servant leadership is a must. Energized for me is tricky. I've seen folks who were a bit more low key but could whip a crowd into a frenzy if need be.
1179073035967401984 2019-10-01 16:38:12 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rstone57 Definitely, Rich. I tried to capture effort in competitive but it should have been it's own. Attitude is on point. Coachable as well.
1178840959905255424 2019-10-01 01:16:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk Damn. I love this one.

1178764452122025985 2019-09-30 20:12:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Really great sales leaders are hard to find.  There are LOTS of traits they need.

1178026314487361536 2019-09-28 19:18:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don Julio was so laughingly bad it’s unthinkable to me that it would be included. Restaurants like Contramar in CDMX are so incredible I can’t imagine them being left off.
1178026312532774912 2019-09-28 19:18:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Over the past three years, my wife and I have traveled LATAM for restaurant experiences.

1177600282559221760 2019-09-27 15:06:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Equity is so often worthless. A major risk.  Strong employees will start looking at startups differently. They will take the risk on themselves.  I can freelance and make the same 💰 Doing less work. With no boss.  Why make someone else money?   #startups
1177327483609321473 2019-09-26 21:02:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Out with @JUULvapor CEO.  I've been mortified by watching Juul and the amount of money they have taken in from investors.  Poisoning the youth.  I watched nearly 50% of my sales team hitting the vape. Sickening.  I can't imagine leading or funding a company like this.  #juulsucks

1170401069194604544 2019-09-07 18:18:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @pmmathieson Come to the other side....
1169990145971499009 2019-09-06 15:06:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Sales leaders love when reps proactively ask how to get better, but I don't see that behavior from the leader to their boss. Why?  Are you really waiting until your next performance review to learn what your boss thinks you're doing well &amp; poorly?   Not me.
1169756009721524224 2019-09-05 23:35:40 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @kylesareus Get them in as early as possible and make finding an incredible VP of #Sales that much easier...
1169717339992072198 2019-09-05 21:02:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've run into numerous SaaS founders recently that proudly tell me, "We don't do any marketing!".  As a revenue leader, this doesn't make me excited. It has the opposite impact.  How much better could your company be if you had a skilled #Marketing VP?
1169617311331827713 2019-09-05 14:24:32 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @agazdecki I didn't always believe this...Heard it from Lemkin at SaaStr and experienced it myself first hand...now I'm a believer.

Leadership project - how a candidate thinks through real-life challenges. How do they approach a problem?
1169309654507298819 2019-09-04 18:02:01 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm seeing a trend where interviewers are asking sales candidates trick questions, or questions that are intended to impress others in the interview room.

1169036350743621633 2019-09-03 23:56:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Want to improve your sales process?

1168617593411969030 2019-09-02 20:12:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The key to leaping from employee to business owner appears to be this:  Figure out the worst thing that can happen and make peace with it.

1163977872706375682 2019-08-21 00:55:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @collincadmus @AvenueTP I agree that certain people are more motivated than others. What I don't believe is that all motivated people succeed in every situation. I've watched motived people fail at one company, move to a different company (still motivated) and succeed. What changed?
1163966313317855233 2019-08-21 00:09:29 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP Just fine but I think disappointed. People believe there is a secret to motivation. Like it’s hidden and you just have to turn over enough rocks to find it...unfortunately it’s just hard work to build a program that people go through to be successful.
1163813448968392705 2019-08-20 14:02:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Had 3 client calls yesterday with CEOs from tech companies.

Nah  Motivation comes from:  Training Onboarding Enablement  Give them the "how", the "why" and the skills. #Motivation to follow.

Check those boxes, but always make people #1  Logos move down resumes over time. Products come and go.  Amenities won't matter.  Great people?   Highest ROI there is. Build a network. Never need a resume again.
1162064780200308736 2019-08-15 18:13:28 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @miles_matthias @naval I really enjoyed Atomic Habits by James Clear, as well as Factfulness by Hans Rosling
1162064608846217216 2019-08-15 18:12:47 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Boom.
1161742880148348929 2019-08-14 20:54:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> U begin to believe that you’re destined to succeed as you continue to work the way you always have. Then it snowballs from there. That's the win! Impostor syndrome will always be there. Under the surface. Ready to strike. I hope this gives you a little ammo to handle it.
1161742879624065024 2019-08-14 20:54:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 6: The Snowball Effect. I think I finally have my impostor syndrome under control. I believe in myself, and when I look back on my accomplishments, I feel really satisfied. I no longer believe I’m lucky or simply instinctual. When you contain it, you start to gain confidence.
1161742879003271168 2019-08-14 20:54:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Look back! Be good to yourself. Smile when you see the upward trajectory of your career. Make this a quarterly or bi-annual commitment to yourself. I’m process-oriented, so heck - put a reminder in your calendar right now. You’ll begin to see that you are truly worthy of praise.
1161742878437064706 2019-08-14 20:54:21 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Take the time to review your accomplishments and celebrate how far you have come. Sales managers with impostor syndrome are likely to view their successful teams as luck and won’t stop to think about where they were as leaders five years prior - pounding the phones as top SDRs
1161742877891784704 2019-08-14 20:54:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 5: Ponder your accomplishments. It all comes back to the question I posed at the beginning. “If a stranger shared these accomplishments with me, would the logical conclusion be that they are all a strike of luck and therefore a fraud?”
1161742877161951232 2019-08-14 20:54:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Instead, start thinking about how you actually approach not knowing something. Focus on curiosity, diligence, and your work ethic. Those are the things that matter much more than what you know.
1161742876604170240 2019-08-14 20:54:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> We’re trying to solve similar challenges, figure out complex problems, and we end up trading failures and lessons learned. So stop worrying about what you do and don’t know, and believing you should know it all. That’s a tall order.
1161742875761135616 2019-08-14 20:54:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> They’re all probably very smart, and know a lot about their industry &amp; business. But they don’t know everything. I’ve discovered many times that when I sit down with a well-respected thought leader for the first time, we’re in the same boat.
1161742874880299008 2019-08-14 20:54:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> The processes you can install get new acronyms and get more complicated every 6 months. It’s impossible to keep up. That’s ok. It doesn’t matter who you idolize, whether it’s a particular sales leader, CEO, or internet personality.
1161742874356011008 2019-08-14 20:54:20 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4: The stuff you don’t know? They might not know either. I’ve been building SaaS sales teams for over a decade now, and I’m still learning new techniques, skills, technology, and process every single day. The amount of knowledge available to us is unlimited and growing.
1161742873810722817 2019-08-14 20:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I sat there with my mouth agape. Needless to say, this has been a very similar story in many of my engagements. Remember that the information you’re familiar with is not always common knowledge. You know more than you think you do
1161742873156435968 2019-08-14 20:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> When I walked in and sat down with the client, we started going through his sales funnel, and I was surprised to find that he didn’t know what MQLs, SQLs, or SALs were. He didn’t have a funnel. He wasn’t measuring conversions. He didn’t have sales technology.
1161742872300810240 2019-08-14 20:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I remember preparing for hours to make sure I was ready to have the most robust conversation about SaaS sales in history. I had workbooks, notepads, excel sheets of information and formulas. I was ready.
1161742871487107072 2019-08-14 20:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Let me give you an example: I signed my first consulting client a few years ago. The client was the CEO &amp; founder of a VC-backed health tech company. When he signed the agreement, I was simultaneously excited and completely terrified. What was I going to teach a CEO?
1161742870958624768 2019-08-14 20:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 3: The curse of granted knowledge. Granted knowledge is when you’ve learned something and have known it for so long, that you can’t imagine other people not knowing it. To me, this is an extremely important component of impostor syndrome.
1161742870425919488 2019-08-14 20:54:19 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> So, if you’re questioning your own legitimacy, write out your accomplishments and ask yourself, “If a stranger shared these with me, would the logical conclusion be that they are all a strike of luck and therefore a fraud?” Probably not. Ur likely more talented than you think.
1161742869851283456 2019-08-14 20:54:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> As more wins and accomplishments pile up, they aren’t able to clear the cobwebs and look at their achievements for what they really are: high performance.
1161742869339656192 2019-08-14 20:54:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Following this logic, they conclude that they’re fraudulent and it’s only a matter of time until the luck runs out, and they’re exposed. It’s an unconscious refusal to assign credit appropriately. A mental rearrangement of the facts.
1161742867502493696 2019-08-14 20:54:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 2: You’re probably more talented than you think. Impostor syndrome tends to impact top performers because they struggle to express how and why they perform the way they do. Because they can’t quite “put a finger on it”, they revert back to luck.
1161742866852409344 2019-08-14 20:54:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> As I’ve peeled the layer back, it’s clear that most of these decisions are made in a process-oriented, diligence-first way. The process and diligence are often so automatic, that it feels like instinct. It’s not.
1161742866294562816 2019-08-14 20:54:18 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People often attribute good decision making to “luck”, because they are not always able to effectively describe why they made a decision or why they made it at a particular time.
1161742865170460673 2019-08-14 20:54:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 1: Luck and timing are real (sort of). I think my dad said it best when he told me, “The better you are, the luckier you get.” As I’ve examined my own career and spoken with top performers, executives, and leaders - one thing has become really clear:
1161742864604209152 2019-08-14 20:54:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> In an effort to overcome my own impostor syndrome, I attempted to break down the evidence and examine it as though I was helping one of my own clients. To remove “me” from the equation. Here’s what I’ve learned over the past year:
1161742863593398272 2019-08-14 20:54:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> But that has never been the case with my own accomplishments. In my mind, my achievements were always a heaping helping of luck served with a side of great timing. I couldn’t feel grounded in the fact that my hard work had paid off.
1161742862305730561 2019-08-14 20:54:17 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> THREAD: What I learned from my own Impostor Syndrome:   I consider myself a reasonable and rational person. With a combination of good context and supporting evidence, I generally think I assess situations correctly, and with confidence.   #impostorsyndrome

1161264747880206337 2019-08-13 13:14:25 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @AvenueTP @NotionHQ @notejoyapp It just appears to be a tool that I can use to manage all of my docs, tasks, travel, notes, etc in on place. It's powerful but I'm not sure if I'm even scratching the surface yet.
1161264551918129152 2019-08-13 13:13:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @andreasjonssonn @NotionHQ I'm using it to manage tasks, aggregate documents, take notes, etc. But I'm not sure I even understand the power of it yet.
1161150314910609408 2019-08-13 05:39:42 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I'm a few days into using @NotionHQ for my business and personal life.   I'm loving it so far but feel like I'm just scratching the surface bc I'm so rooted in old #tech.  Is there a great primer out there?  #notion

1161022063416680449 2019-08-12 21:10:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I don't get the overnight "I'm an expert" fad I see on #LinkedIn.  I mean, I guess I get it. People want to make $$.   The sad part? Most of ya'll aren't fooling anyone.   Play the long game. Become the ACTUAL expert and guide along the way.  Much more fun. Much more real.   ✌🏻

And you're already stressing about the next one.   Q's to consider:  How do I enjoy the day-to-day? How do I maintain identity when this is gone?   ✌🏻

1156667116541685765 2019-07-31 20:45:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Don't create content to go viral.  What's a common problem that you know how to solve?  Create content to teach people that.   If your content is well done. If your advice is sound.  If you're authentic. If you're humble.   The virality will come.

Throw a tantrum.  Tell everyone how much you hate your job. Burn bridges.  I wrote an article for @SalesHacker outlining your choices.    https://t.co/FsdgArOXXZ

1151958594369282061 2019-07-18 20:55:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> "The grass is always greener..."   In business, it's meant to suggest another opportunity is probably just as bad as your current one.   Sometimes the grass goes as the gardener goes.  You're the gardener.  You carry your own hose.   It's up to you to water your grass.  ✌🏻

1151647167347511296 2019-07-18 00:17:35 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> A lot of shiny object syndrome comes in the form of new distribution channels with high upside.   Miscalculation is in speed to revenue.   If you're early in, double down on distribution channel that's working.   Open to wildly different thoughts.   #SaaS #sales
1151599981612154881 2019-07-17 21:10:05 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Consistency.  The key to nearly everything you want to do in your career.   You can't "hack" it.   It requires planning, patience, time, &amp; effort.  It separates the real from the fake. The posers.   Marathon vs. sprint mentality.   ✌🏻
1151511910178668544 2019-07-17 15:20:08 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @Saket___ Agreed. They also have a game plan for dealing with these things. Stay the course. Be consistent.
1151509549225897986 2019-07-17 15:10:45 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @HarvardBiz That’s because people likely optimize for short-term earnings potential vs. mission/vision/values. Get aligned somewhere with those things and find joy + long-term earnings.

Do you have a process/approach for evaluating whether or not your product is underpriced? Have raised prices multiple times in my journey with very few problems. Other companies I speak with are incredibly apprehensive. Thx.

Being scrappy as hell. $10M? Understanding the trends and data. $50M? All mental. Can we all keep our minds pushing forward? Interesting. #startups
1135562545228636161 2019-06-03 15:03:03 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> People are more likely to engage with me on problem solving when I'm honest ab my level of confidence. Even if low. Or I'm nervous that I don't know how to solve. There's an aspect of honesty and vulnerability that resonates with people that you don't get with bravado and pomp.

1134979806657826816 2019-06-02 00:27:27 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I’m really feeling @MarcoPoloApp for quick video communication with family/friends. I see a business play on it, too. Trying to figure that out. Feels like it should have a bigger user base.
1134623258278367232 2019-06-01 00:50:39 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @jasonlk Gimme state school.
1134260363153690625 2019-05-31 00:48:38 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @turing_police @Its_Jenn_Here hahaha
1134097900760444928 2019-05-30 14:03:04 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Do you take chances at work? Find something broken in your process. Know how to fix it? 90% positive? 60%? Do it. Run your play. That's what do'ers do. Don't wait for permission. Start small. Measure results. Wrong? Try again. Right? Find something else. That's the game 😃
1133973994397286400 2019-05-30 05:50:43 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @allisonbraley @nickabouzeid I'm more than 2 hours early for any flight. 6am included. I'll still hustle @Its_Jenn_Here luggage through like we're 20 minutes late. Gotta have goals.
1133914737874354176 2019-05-30 01:55:15 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @stevekovach My CEO is at 4.53  When he showed me it was like looking at a photo of Bigfoot.
1133810999318982657 2019-05-29 19:03:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> 4% YoY annual raises (or whatever big box co.'s are doing now) will never get you to the BIG money. Asking for 5k and 10k raises every 12 months won't do it. People need to stop thinking short-term. Go get a big bundle of experience. Some are worth $50k. Some? $150k. Go long.
1133735502518116360 2019-05-29 14:03:02 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've often found that people who use a lot of jargon do so as sort of a defense mechanism in their careers. Gives off the sense that they know way more than you do. Self-protection in a way. Usually, they just never get any shit done. Give me simple and results-oriented all day.

1133373107887120386 2019-05-28 14:03:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you want access to executives, spend time on LinkedIn &amp; get to know their direct reports. Find a consistent challenge. When you have enough info, go for the exec. But don't go for the sale. Make an intro to another exec you helped w/ same problem. Long-term selling, baby.
1133025819419447297 2019-05-27 15:03:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Been looking around and notice that there is not a lot of executive-level education for salespeople. A lot of sales 101 (objections, hitting quotas, etc.) But not much ab salary negotiation, building op plans, equity comp. So I'm building it. Late 2019.   https://t.co/KbBmKbaC25

1132704491894190081 2019-05-26 17:46:10 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I've been leaning towards @webflow for my personal website, but can't find a ton of examples of personal brands being built on it. Should I be going @WordPress instead? Is there any example of @Webflow sites someone can share? #webdesign #nocode
1132678465272991750 2019-05-26 16:02:44 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @BradTonoff @Vanguard_Group Definitely a good fee structure and nice service...but man...The online portal is just a disaster. How does that happen in 2019?
1132654427360206848 2019-05-26 14:27:13 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> I moved all of my money to @Vanguard_Group. I'm one month in and I just can't fathom that they are satisfied with their online experience. It's like 2004. Some company is going to crush them simply by being easy to use. Holy moly.

1131900151952547840 2019-05-24 12:30:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> Salespeople always want raises but rarely want to build a business case to go get it. Getting extra $$ that isn't tied to commission just means the company is paying a higher % for every sale that you make. You need a business case. Lay it out. Make it good. Ask for a f/u date.

Starting to feel like Twitter. I have a hard time hating on people for creating. It's SO easy to be kind to people. Let's start encouraging good content not destroying it.

As a guy who has had some decent success,  I think the middle ground is hustling and not telling everyone about it.
1131053295013773317 2019-05-22 04:24:54 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @rogerdickey Depends on what you consider hustle porn. Shutting up and outworking your competition or broadcasting the fact you had a late night for all of your fans.  Nobody really hustling has the time to tell you about it.
1131028682728861696 2019-05-22 02:47:06 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> @brian_armstrong Nah. It's a balance between short and long.

1130822552304128000 2019-05-21 13:08:00 +0000 <thejustinwelsh> If you're a #salesperson or #salesleader and you're reading a ton of sales books, you need to stop and think about whether or not you've executed on any of the lessons learned. If not, put down the books and start executing. Output, not input.
